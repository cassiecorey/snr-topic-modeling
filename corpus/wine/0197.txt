My last bottle of this.  It's really a relaxed, fully mature, attractive and balanced wine.  Enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that I remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance.  Very good.  I notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12.5% alcohol. ***
