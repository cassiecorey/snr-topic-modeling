Sold to me in Oddbins as the wine that beat Dom Perignon in a recent competition. Actually it might have been the NV Blin that did this - different assistants in Oddbins attributed the result to both wines. This wine is good, but not DP good. There's a touch of sweetness and some heaviness of hand. **(*)
