Quite mineral, but this seems a bit flabbier, flatter and lacking freshness than I remember.   I could worry that we have a touch of premature-oxidation disease here although the wine is perfectly drinkable.   I hope it's an odd bottle, the one I had in July 2004 was fine and I've had a couple since which I did not note because they were similar.   **
