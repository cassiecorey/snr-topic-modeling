Talento is apparantly a trademark of a consortium of growers in Northern Italy making Methode Champenoise fizz from mainly Champagne grapes.   This is made by Prosecco producer Bisol.   It has the charcteristic yeasty character, fine fruit, it's dry but not over-austere.  Nice - it might make an interesting ringer in a flight of growers Champagnes.  ***
