I haven't tasted this for eight years, I think.   I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich, extravagently viscous texture. There's a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish.   Very lovely, but I have slight reservations about the complexity -  it does seem, as one might perhaps expect from the grape, a touch one-dimensional given its other qualities. ****
