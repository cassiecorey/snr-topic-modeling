Light to medium weight, elegant, complex and nutty, quite long.   Just occasionally it seems a little oily/keroseney on the palate but that may be the food I am having with it.   Really pretty good, although probably for drinking over the next couple of years.  A good deal from Oddbins at not muchover ≈Å20. Bare ****
