The things one finds when cataloguing the cellar - an auction purchase of a couple of bottles I seem to recall.  I opened one with trepidation but no need: actually a healthy light colour and a lovely, fresh, tar and roses Barolo nose.  The fruit had that underlying sweetness that good Barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins.   Not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking.   ***
