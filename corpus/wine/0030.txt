Huge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather.   I find this a bit much. Returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit  and to be a substantial wine in its way, although I find it hard to decide about it. Many will admire this, and I may too given time to consider it - I had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed.  I think I'll reserve judgement for now. Not Rated
