My memory of vintages of this Provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good: Provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box.   Very much a point and it has kept well.  A little simple perhaps but I believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property.   Good effort - I'd like to try some other vintages. ***
