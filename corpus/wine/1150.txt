These three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that FWD isn't always very kind to Beaujolais. I tasted these with LJM (sometime contributor to FWD). I'm afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about Beaujolais. But they have persuaded me that I need to try a few more.
