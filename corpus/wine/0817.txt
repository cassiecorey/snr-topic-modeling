A bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner.   Bright and attractive raspberry, cranberry and beetroot Pinot - a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style.   Very pleasant drinking but not profound.   Will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long-term wine. ***
