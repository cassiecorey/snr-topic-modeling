The Lamaione is a disappointing wine. I remember having it for the fist time (before FWD, in 1995 or earlier I guess). Then it oozed class, and in 1997 I still rated it highly. But since then it has declined, and now one word will do: 'undrinkable' - although I've expanded slightly beyond that below. I wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making (carb. mac.?). There aren't many wines I've poured down the sink, but this was one of them.
