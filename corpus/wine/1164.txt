This is half Chardonnay and half Pinot Meunier - the latter not that apparent. Very yeasty, seems a bit four-square at the moment (perhaps that is where one sees the P-M). Rich and really very  long.   Clearly need quite a lot of time,  and I can see it could well be very good in a decade or so, although it might be a bit light on finesse.  Bare **(**)
