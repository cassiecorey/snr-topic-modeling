OK, so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage. The label wasn't in the best condition. The next morning I was just sorting through the corks when I noticed we had really been drinking the 1982. The last time I had this wine I was disappointed, and I was again this time. It's OK, but it hasn't got the structure or depth expected. ***
