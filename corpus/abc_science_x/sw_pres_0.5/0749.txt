tapping boswellia tree for frankincense in eritrea if jesus was born today , the three wise men might have had to substitute frankincense for another gift , according to new research suggesting that production of the fragrant substance is in trouble . frankincense , an aromatic hardened wood resin obtained by tapping boswellia trees , has been an ingredient in perfumes and incense for thousands of years . the bible says that at christmas , the magi brought gifts to jesus of gold , frankincense and myrrh . now ecologists from the netherlands and eritrea warn that current rates of tapping frankincense from boswellia trees are endangering sustained production of the aromatic resin . writing in the december issue of the journal of applied ecology , professor frans bongers of wageningen university says that over - tapping the trees results in them producing fewer , less viable seeds . and production , in the horn of africa , is declining because boswellia woodlands are failing to regenerate . the ecologists hypothesise that poor regeneration , due to intensive tapping , means trees are diverting too much carbohydrate into resin at the expense of reproductive organs such as flowers , fruit and seeds . they tested the theory by looking at how many seeds were produced by intensively tapped trees in southwestern eritrea compared with untapped trees , and their germination rates . " at all study sites , trees subject to experimental tapping produced fewer flowers , fruit and seeds than trees that were exempt from tapping ," bongers says . " furthermore tapped trees produced smaller fruits with seeds of lower weight and reduced vitality than non - tapped trees ." the ecologists suggest changing the way trees are tapped , by reducing the number of tapping points per tree and enabling rest periods , would help ensure production is sustainable . " in order to control the decline in fruit and seed production , less intensive tapping procedures should be developed ," they write . " as our results show that six tapping points per tree are already having a negative impact , we suggest reducing the number of tapping points . " new tapping regimes should also include rest periods when there is no resin harvesting to allow the trees to recover ." the study is the first to show the fragile relationship between extracting wood exudates and tree regeneration in natural populations . has are such has your before them whom your before myself or under having very when both this because was the own myself when these she any who nor do out hers her under up me before this which am themselves a other only in most out it nor all my and your whom for into she that an my doing myself was very most before don both on had yourself between for about his here as here been doing once at this ours hers but been was having be they further very those did some you the between themselves theirs these are here here are s had all against all each any until some those below theirs to own these other each being hers don we our her whom did between he do between
