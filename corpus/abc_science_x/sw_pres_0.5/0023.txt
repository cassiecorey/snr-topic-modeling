pericles probably died of typhoid fever , as did as many as one - third of his fellow athenians modern dna analysis of ancient dental pulp suggests that typhoid fever caused the plague that helped to end the golden age in athens , scientists say . the dna collected from teeth from an ancient greek burial site is similar to a modern organism that causes typhoid fever , an infection spread by contaminated food or water . " studying the historical aspects of infectious disease can be a powerful tool for several disciplines to learn from ," says dr manolis papagrigorakis of university of athens , a co - author of the study published in the international journal of infectious diseases . " we believe this report to be of outstanding importance for many scientific fields , since it sheds light on one of the most debated enigmas in medical history ." up to one - third of athenians are thought to have died from the plague that spread to greece from ethiopia , egypt and libya in 430 - 426 bc . several diseases including smallpox , bubonic plague , anthrax and measles have been suggested as the cause of the plague , one of whose most prominent victims was the athenian golden age leader pericles . the plague is thought to have changed the balance of power between athens and sparta , ending athenian dominance . the scientists describe how they extracted dna from a mass burial pit in a cemetery dating back to the time the plague struck greece . papagrigorakis and his team say the dna sequences resembled salmonella enterica serovar typhi , the organism that causes typhoid fever . that is the i there he if a all why or up t will how should does through he or before for if against be whom what other into above yours and out don then what being each yourselves but hers did who those yours again it yourselves those themselves which our s than too her at been during over himself are when do these her not he because off herself doing is he she her which more no against having own have there
