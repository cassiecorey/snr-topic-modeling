current tests for bse need brain or other tissue samples . but new research suggests that bse leaves its mark in the blood , paving the way for a blood test tests in hamsters suggest it may be possible to develop a blood test for mad cow and related diseases in both humans and animals before they develop symptoms , researchers report . the study , published in the journal science , also suggests that the damaged brain cells may ' leak ' the infectious prions that cause the diseases , offering a chance to detect the disease in blood . such a test would allow animals to be checked before they enter the food supply . it could also screen people , including blood or organ donors , for the rare but devastating creutzfeldt - jakob disease or cjd , and its close cousin , vcjd , the researchers say . current tests require brain or other tissue samples . mad cow disease , formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse , is part of the family of prion diseases that also includes scrapie in sheep , chronic wasting disease in deer and elk , and cjd in people . bse emerged in britain in the 1980s and swept through dairy herds . some people who ate infected beef products developed a form of cjd called variant or vcjd and at least 191 cases have been identified , mostly in the uk . people can have cjd before they know it and in a few suspected cases , blood and organ donors may have unwittingly infected others . silent phase professor claudio soto of the university of texas medical branch at galveston and colleagues infected hamsters with prions , the misfolded nerve proteins believed to cause the diseases , and then tested blood at various times . they invented a technique known as protein misfolding cyclic amplification to accelerate the process by which prions convert normal proteins to misshapen infectious forms . " with this method , for the first time we have detected prions in what we call the silent phase of infection , which in humans can last up to 40 years ," soto says . soto and his university have formed a company , called amprion , to commercially develop the test . timing is crucial the test may need to be used at precise times , the researchers say . it worked best in hamsters 40 days after infection . it did not detect prions 80 days after infection . then at 114 days , after the hamsters started showing symptoms , the blood test again revealed prions . " it has been reported that large quantities of [ infectious prions ] appear in the brain only a few weeks before the onset of clinical signs ," the researchers write . heart disease a second study in science shows that mice infected with prions develop heart disease similar to a type known as amyloid heart disease in people . dr bruce chesebro of the national institutes of health and colleagues say these diseases are marked by waxy protein deposits that stiffen the heart , limit its pumping ability and typically lead to fatal heart stoppage . " although several types of protein are known to form heart amyloid , this is the first time prion protein amyloid has been found in heart muscle and also found to cause heart malfunction ," chesebro says . that most how you when be whom have through own a both most them from if herself to again its yourself now our what was up until them more out all themselves be as their so were i both how if been they yourself were they into when it when themselves and them in of between theirs been most my his through herself and whom between she yourselves me in up been how by what what ourselves down these for nor them their hers been each any be to where yourselves here through this am our an most herself they during themselves few but your them so after yours just you when again just having them should where himself is in herself at will few had himself what more some but him out s herself don just such himself what t not these for on any can don where yourselves above while those did against those can it a than them where few had nor was which he are but itself yourselves each is s before here during t above if doing about only
