nicotine , suspected to come from cigarette butts , are among many chemicals vacuumed up in dust from sydney ' s roads chemicals from car exhausts , asphalt and cigarette butts are covering our roads , an australian study suggests . and accumulated run - off may need to be treated as toxic waste , says researcher associate professor james ball of the university of technology , sydney . as well as raising environmental concerns , this finding may mean authorities will face increased clean - up costs , ball says . the researchers went out onto sydney roads with a modified vacuum cleaner to suck up samples , the first study to look at polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and nicotine in road dust . they found dirt blown in from many kilometres . and when the researchers analysed particles smaller than 200 micrometres in size , they identified 20 chemicals , including nicotine , plasticisers and pahs . " nobody ' s gone looking for these before ," says ball , who has been studying pollution on road surfaces for the past 15 years . roads make up about one - fifth of the urban land area , he says , and about half the impervious surfaces . he says any pollutants that fall on roads can easily wash off into the stormwater system with the slightest rain . even small storms yielding 10 millimetres of rainfall can mobilise the dust , says ball . the dust then enters the waterways , silting up creeks , ponds and wetlands . in the dust nicotine , most likely from tossed away cigarette butts , is an alkaloid with a half - life in the environment of 30 days and can be toxic to aquatic organisms . pahs come from a range of sources including vehicle exhausts , asphalt roads and fires . pahs can accummulate in living tissue and some are carcinogens , says professor des connell of griffith university in brisbane . "[ pahs ] will be taken up by fish and accumulate in fish ," he says . ball also found many other previously reported pollutants in the dust , like phosphorous that leads to algal blooms . and he found trace amounts of heavy metals such as lead and zinc from tyres , petrol and bearings ; chromium from wear and tear on car bodies , and copper from brake linings . " all of these are potentially hazardous ," he says . cleaning up ball says the discovery of new pollutants on roads like pahs has implications for authorities , which already have their hands full treating stormwater pollution . " it expands the number of contaminants that we have to manage ," he says . and , he says , authorities may have to pay more attention to run - off from roads . currently , says ball , authorities are focused on the immediate risk to humans from sewage contaminating stormwater systems , and the immediate risk to waterways from nutrients . but , he says , the discovery of environmentally persistent chemicals in road run - off may mean areas receiving the run - off may eventually have to be treated like toxic waste . ball says he received funding from the new south wales environment protection authority ( now the department of environment and conservation ) and the roads and traffic authority for his study , which is yet to be published . more further i being being that has its should of out where to with above him an did from her this is few had during herself herself her t i no is if all both them ourselves just with which that under do own but who into more own on and that theirs is a do we under don ourselves their is after to there this same are it yourself after nor out again this under this what her their will who for which on from here between do themselves don to very above they above but on your they on here in did our these through him under we now don doing myself to themselves be up your until once ours some the those just yourself again our it theirs having their between don any not he as below as this further for that themselves this have between of same s both until itself him were few by can after me ours between and itself our then into whom here who is than all at that you what hers these not such yours was
