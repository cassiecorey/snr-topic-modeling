the pinwheel galaxy contains one trillion stars the largest and most detailed image of a spiral galaxy has been released , including surprising views of its star - forming regions . the image is of the gigantic pinwheel galaxy , or messier 101 , and was compiled from 51 images from the hubble space telescope , with extra data from ground - based telescopes . the image reveals a giant spiral disc of stars , dust and gas , some 170 , 000 light - years across , about twice the diameter of the milky way . a high - resolution version of the image , which shows individual stars , is available on the space telescope science institute website . the galaxy contains about one trillion stars , about 100 billion thought to be about the same age and temperature as our sun . its spiral arms have large star - forming nubulae , star nurseries in hydrogen clouds . and bright young clusters of newborn blue stars trace out the spiral arms . the disc of the galaxy is so thin , the researchers say , that hubble easily sees many more distant galaxies through it . the pinwheel galaxy lies in the northern constellation the great bear and is about 25 million light - years from earth . the light we see from the galaxy today is as it was at the beginning of the miocene period on earth , when mammals flourished and the mastodon first appeared , the researchers say . the composite image was compiled from images originally taken to study the expansion rate of the universe , star cluster formation , x - ray emissions and blue supergiant stars . down these your again same because out into up more between only against under once themselves do all at or than myself is below more why after here because up herself does myself as they her am with too him are more you more that yourselves been an off further theirs both while hers each whom up which does that was yourselves such very your again i very and other when again doing and been do me yourselves of to his is where their own before from we just
