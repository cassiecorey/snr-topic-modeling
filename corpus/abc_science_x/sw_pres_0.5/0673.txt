picture books help 2 - 3 year olds learn about the world . but are some books better than others ? toddlers can re - enact what they see , hear and learn from picture books , new research shows . the finding suggests that picture books may play a much greater role than simply entertaining toddlers and may help them understand the world . researchers from the university of queensland and the university of virginia publish their findings in the latest issue of the journal developmental psychology . researchers know that picture books can help 4 - 5 year old preschoolers with a range of literary and ' life ' skills . but it is harder to assess what 2 - 3 year olds learn simply because they don ' t have the language skills to tell us . " so what we did in our study was to let toddlers show us what they know using a re - enactment , or imitation paradigm ," says australian author dr gabrielle simcock , a postdoctoral fellow at the university of queensland . researchers read toddlers a picture book that described how to make a toy rattle . they then asked the toddlers to make a rattle using the objects supplied : a green wooden ball , a stick attached to a plastic lid and a clear plastic jar . some 36 children in each of three age groups ( 18 months , 24 months and 30 months ) were read either a picture book featuring colour photographs of a rattle being made , a picture book with coloured pencil drawings of a rattle being made , or not read a book at all . overall , children across all groups shown the colour photograph book were more successful in their attempts to make a rattle than those shown a colour drawing book or no book . toddlers aged 24 months and 30 months did equally well with both versions of the book . but the 18 month toddlers shown the colour photograph book did much better than those shown the colour drawing book . " the 18 month children needed the representation in the book to be highly realistic and to match very closely to the real world before they could understand , while the older children were much more flexible in their ability to use the pictures ." the control group was least likely to be able to make the rattle . simcock says the findings are exciting , but don ' t mean that parents should only read their children only picture books with real - life photographs . " i think it ' s through cumulative exposure to a wide range of different types of books and illustrations that children begin to abstract that the pictures in the books can represent real world things ," she says . " and not all books are informative about the real world ; often they might be animals talking and doing things ...
