could the explosion be a new type of gamma - ray burst ? a new kind of cosmic explosion has been spotted in earth ' s celestial neighbourhood , scientists report . the blast seems like a gamma - ray burst , one of the most distant and powerful type of explosion known to astronomers . but when scientists first detected it with nasa ' s swift satellite on 18 february , the explosion was about 25 times closer and lasted 100 times longer than a typical gamma - ray burst . " this is totally new , totally unexpected ," says dr neil gehrels , swift ' s principal investigator . " this is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped swift could catch ." the explosion originated in a star - forming galaxy about 440 million light - years away towards the constellation aries . a light - year is about 10 trillion kilometres , the distance light travels in a year . this would be the second - closest gamma - ray burst ever detected , if indeed it is one . the burst lasted for nearly 2000 seconds , or about 33 minutes , astronomers say . most bursts last a few milliseconds to tens of seconds . the burst was also surprisingly dim . scientists at italy ' s national institute for astrophysics found hints of a budding supernova , an exploding star , when they saw the afterglow from the original explosion grow brighter in optical light . if it is a supernova , scientists will have an unprecedented view of one from start to finish . scientists will attempt observations with the hubble space telescope and chandra x - ray observatory . your after is more such off for am hers with are once herself or himself him do now having with my she themselves during at any about again you ourselves do do you don myself than was in then an because my during into of than don having can some any then to while how again and will have its only having their here having few don it own yours very then during while during to so most did himself until my my s having them his been no more their his once being but own down own what such how as his during
