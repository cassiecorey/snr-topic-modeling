jupiter ' s great red spot , with its smaller cousin red spot junior , seen through a special filter that samples thermal radiation from deep in the cloud layer astronomers have taken images of jupiter ' s lesser known red spot , a smaller landmark called red spot junior . the smaller spot is about as wide as earth and formed from the merger of three white spots sometime between 1998 and 2000 . red spot junior only turned red in december 2005 , astronomers say . using the keck ii telescope on hawaii ' s mauna kea , scientists from the university of california , berkeley , and the wm keck observatory captured a high - resolution picture of both small and large red spots late in july . both are located in the same area and appear to be racing each other around the planet . the larger great red spot rotates westwards , in the opposite direction to the planet , the scientists say . as alternating bands on the surface of jupiter move in opposite directions , the nearby smaller spot moves eastwards . the two spots are about the same colour when seen in visible light , but red spot junior is much darker when viewed at infrared wavelengths , the scientists say . that difference could mean the smaller storm ' s cloud tops are lower than the big storm ' s . astronomers have known about jupiter ' s great red spot , a high - pressure storm on the big planet ' s surface , for centuries . this better known spot is nearly twice its smaller companion ' s size and has been circling jupiter for at least 342 years . them or during are when here before been them out more they yourselves below be such at any above own why too in few than was between if was should herself ours ourselves how himself and are and between most on not very from and own out she be too am now it theirs nor am yours themselves any other on not then those he nor to during will through other these too the they against than once for just too he she once be to we yours until having this themselves over that why
