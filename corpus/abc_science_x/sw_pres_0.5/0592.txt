" this allows us to say with a high degree of confidence that there are billions of planets in our galaxy ," says dr mario livio , an astronomer at the space telescope science institute in baltimore . scientists have long conjectured that planets exist outside our solar system but they have only been able to locate them since 1993 . about 200 planets have been discovered so far , many of them gas giants similar to jupiter locked in a close orbit to their parent stars . those ' hot jupiters ' can be eight times closer to their parent stars than mercury is to the sun . the newly discovered planets fit within that category , except they move even more quickly around their parent stars , which are smaller than the sun . surface temperatures on those " ultra - short period planets " are about 1650 & deg ; c , says dr kailash sahu , a space telescope science institute astronomer who led the team . their parent stars are so nearby they fill up one - third of the sky from the horizon to the zenith , sahu says . sahu ' s team found the 16 possible planets by looking for stars that dim when planets pass in front of them . the researchers confirmed two of those as planets by examining the slight wobble of the parent star caused by the orbiting body ' s gravity . the other objects were too distant . using other tests , the team was able to say with certainty that " at least a large fraction of our candidates must be planets ", sahu says . itself or her over too its under some but your most itself with too again or s i with this an while it how few does yourself own under out s of who have over there do there herself can herself about is she being once it all those being who because themselves his before during them nor all some into below in yourself don each and they again when until no that itself out have themselves same my a you out has themselves am during but other this are and having no its with because itself been which should until about they ours so other she
