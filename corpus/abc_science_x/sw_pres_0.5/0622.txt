the fish skull emerging from the rock it was found in fish developed features characteristic of land animals much earlier than once thought , say researchers . dr john long of museum victoria and colleagues base their conclusions on an uncrushed 380 million - year - old fish fossil found in western australia . " the specimen is the most perfect complete three - dimensional fish of its kind ever discovered in the whole world ," says long , who reports the team ' s findings online today in the journal nature . " it looks like it died yesterday . you can still open and close the mouth ." long says the preserved remains of a gogonasus fish from the devonian period were found last year in the remote kimberley area at the gogo fossil site , once an ' ancient barrier reef ' teeming with fish . previous analyses based on limited material suggested gogonasus had relatively primitive features , says long . but when his team used a ct scanner at the australian national university to analyse this new fossil , it found the fish had a number of features common to land animals . " it ' s hiding a lot of deceptively advanced features that were not recognised before until we had such a perfect specimen ," says long . for example , gogonasus had hole in its skull similar to that found in the first land animals , he says . this hole eventually became the eustachian tube in higher vertebrates , says long . his team ' s analysis also revealed the fish ' s pectoral fin had the same pattern of bones as the forelimbs or arms of land animals , called tetrapods . " it ' s definitely a fish . it ' s got gills , it swims in water , it ' s got fins ," says long . " but it ' s a fish that is showing the beginnings of the tetrapod ' s advanced body plan that would eventually carry on to all living land animals ." gogonasus also had a cheek bone structure similar to early amphibian and a single pair of nostrils , like we have , says long . wolf in sheep ' s clothing earlier this year scientists reported the discovery of tiktaalik roseae , a 375 million - year - old species of fish that filled the evolutionary gap in the transition between water and land animals . while tiktaalik had a skull that was identical to an amphibian , gogonasus looks much more like a fish , says long .
