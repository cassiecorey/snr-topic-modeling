latest image of the first light in the universe fresh evidence of the first objects to emerge after the big bang has left scientists debating what these could be . researchers say the cosmic glow could be the first stars or quasars , but are not sure which . dr alexander kashlinsky and colleagues at the nasa goddard space flight center will report their findings in the 1 january issue of the astrophysical journal . using nasa ' s spitzer space telescope , the researchers analysed infrared radiation from deep space . they first removed the bright signal of recent galaxies in the foreground to detect the the ancient background glow . the researchers saw clumps in this infrared background radiation they believe comes from the first objects to emerge from the big bang . " observing the cosmic infrared background is like watching distant fireworks from within a brightly lit city ," says kashlinsky . " it ' s as if we have turned off the city lights one by one to see the bursts more clearly ." building on their study published in the journal nature last year , the researchers say they could be picking up light from the earliest stars , stretched to infrared wavelengths by the expansion of the universe . alternatively , they say the distant glow could be from quasars - large black holes that consume enormous amounts of gas and debris and re - emit the materials in powerful burst of energy . less certain the glow comes from stars last year the researchers were reportedly certain the signals from deep space were from the earliest stars . kashlinksy says this was because his team failed to explain that current equipment does not allow the researchers to pinpoint individual sources of the radiation . " we did not make this point sufficiently clear in the nature paper in 2005 and , hence , added a caveat on this in the new papers ," says kashlinksy . " while we can ' t resolve each spark in the fireworks , we can see the large scale structures and their glow ."
