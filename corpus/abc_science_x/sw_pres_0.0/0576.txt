this costa rican zebra tarantula has an archaic way of sticking to surfaces tarantulas secrete sticky silk from their feet to help them adhere to shiny surfaces , says an international team of scientists . spiders are already known to have two mechanisms that allow them to walk upside or cling to smooth vertical surfaces . one is the use of thousands of tiny hairs that generate a weak electrical bond , using van der waals forces , with the surface . another is tiny claws that lock onto rough surfaces . but scientists at the max planck institute for metals research in stuttgart and us colleagues have now found , in tarantulas at least , there is a third gripping tool . tarantulas have microscopic nozzle - like structures on their feet that secrete a viscous silk - like filament . the researchers report their results today in the journal nature . the team carried out its research with zebra tarantulas ( aphonopelma seemanni ) from costa rica , which were induced to walk around a slick , vertical glass surface . to walk up , the spiders used their distal claws to keep a grip . to walk down , they exuded fibres between 0 . 2 and 1 . 0 micrometres in diameter from all four pairs of feet that adhered to the glass and stopped them sliding and falling . the german team , led by dr stanislav gorb at the institute ' s evolutionary biomaterials group , says the new discovery raises questions about spiders ' evolutionary past . arachnids also have an abdominal pouch , a spinneret , which produces the silk to make webs . gorb theorises that spiders may have started making silk with their feet before they began to do so with their spinnerets , as this would have helped their survival by avoiding catastrophic falls . the next step is to carry out a genetic analysis of the foot silk proteins to compare it to the spinneret silk proteins . industrial chemists study spider silk as they are eager to make a synthetic copy that mimics its strength and resilience .
