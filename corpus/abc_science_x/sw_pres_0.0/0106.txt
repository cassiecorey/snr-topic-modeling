in their lifetime , western women will have four times as many periods as women from some traditional societies regularly skipping menstrual periods using methods including the contraceptive pill might help reduce the risk of some gynaecological cancers , a conference will hear next week . professor ian fraser , a professor of reproductive medicine at australia ' s university of sydney , says the fewer periods a woman has , the better . the modern consequences of too much menstruation include breast , ovarian and endometrial cancers , endometriosis , uterine fibroids , polycystic ovary syndrome and severe cyclical menstrual symptoms , he will tell the human reproductive health through the ages conference in adelaide . " the belief is regular menses means ' a good clean out ' but having lots of periods is not a healthy process ," fraser says . " in our society women have many more periods than in primitive societies and each menstrual cycle leads to big swings in the ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone ." fraser says this overstimulates reproductive organs and the breasts . " the uterus , lining of the uterus and breasts were not designed to cope with this and it causes some cells to grow and regress each month , which means a greater chance of error in the proliferation process of abnormal cells ," he says . " breast cancer in our society is 100 - fold greater than in primitive societies and having lots of menstrual cycles probably plays a role in that ." he says substantial increases in the risk of endometrial cancer occurs as the uterus lining grows and regresses each month and in ovarian cancer as ovaries grow and regress during egg release . " my view is we probably have sufficient , strong , supportive anecdotal and suggestive evidence , although no solid long - term evidence , that for many women taking the pill or an intra - uterine device ... for extra years than they might have done for contraception may help later protect against a number of conditions ." fraser says present day kalahari bushwomen have about 100 periods in a lifetime compared with western women ' s 450 . in our society , girls menstruate earlier and women have more periods before giving birth than women like the kalahari . women from traditional societies breastfeed for extended times , often conceive soon after menses return , average five to six pregnancies and have an earlier menopause , all factors that reduce the number of periods they have in a lifetime .
