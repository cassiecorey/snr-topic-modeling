the biological clock ticks for both men as well as women a man ' s fertility appears to decline after the age of 40 , in much the same way that a woman ' s ability to conceive fades after 35 , say french researchers . dr elise de la rochebrochard and team , from the french national health institute inserm , report their findings in the may issue of the journal fertility and sterility . their study , of nearly 2 , 000 couples undergoing fertility treatment , found that pregnancy attempts were 70 % more likely to fail when the man was age 40 or older than if he were younger than 30 , regardless of his wife ' s age . " as an increasing number of couples choose to postpone child - bearing , they should be informed that paternal age over 40 years is an important risk factor for failure to conceive ," say de la rochebrochard and team . because all the women in the study were completely sterile and undergoing in vitro fertilisation ( ivf ), the age of the fathers was key . and while past studies have suggested that older men are less likely to father children , the extent to which this was related to biological changes or to decreased sexual activity has been unclear . " our results provide , for the first time , strong evidence for a paternal age effect on failure to conceive that is linked only to biological male ageing ," the researchers say . according to the researchers , the lower ivf success rate among relatively older men may be due to poorer - quality sperm . it has long been known that women are less likely to conceive after the age of 35 than before , say the researchers but the current findings , they say , suggest that for men , the age of 40 is similarly important . " in reproduction ," the researchers conclude , " age must no longer be considered as the concern of the woman , but as that of the couple ."
