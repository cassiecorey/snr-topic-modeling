the aircraft ' s ' belly ' has been designed to improve lift plans for a new generation of silent aircraft , designed to slash noise output while also cutting fuel consumption , have been unveiled by uk and us aeronautics experts . the single - wing aircraft would hold 250 passengers and use 25 % less fuel than the current average , say its creators who hope to have it flying commercially by 2030 . the silent aircraft initiative ( sai ) has since 2003 gathered some 40 researchers from the university of cambridge and the massachusetts institute of technology , as well as an array of aeronautics - linked firms . as well as cutting engine noise , the designers focused on adapting the structure of the aircraft , which is responsible for half of the noise a plane creates on landing . to do this they created a single flying wing , with the body of the aircraft also functioning to give lift . this allows a slower approach which reduces noise as well as improving fuel efficiency at cruising altitudes , the researchers say . the new plane also does away with flaps , a major source of noise , while the undercarriage has been simplified and its aerodynamics improved . the engines are mounted on the top of the aircraft , to screen much noise from the ground . some backers of the project admit to having had doubts at first about its viability . " my first reaction on hearing of the silent aircraft initiative was profound scepticism ," says dr john green of greener by design , which promotes environmentally - friendly air transport options . " three years on , i have to concede that the sai has surpassed my expectations by quite a margin . the team has produced a ... credible design that is predicted to meet the original target ."
