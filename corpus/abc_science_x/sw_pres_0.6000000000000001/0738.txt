a colonial siphonophore , which grows to 1 . 5 centimetres , found off the coast of broome in northwestern australia a jurassic ' shrimp ' thought extinct 50 million years ago has been found in australian waters , a census of marine life shows . neoglyphea neocaledonica , found on an underwater peak in the coral sea , is the oldest marine organism listed in the 2006 census of marine life , a global effort involving 70 nations . the census , which is due for completion in 2010 , also found marine creatures thriving by a record hot volcanic vent in the atlantic and in dark waters under thick antarctic ice . researchers also found 150 new types of fish among 500 new marine species , including furry crabs and a lobster off madagascar . many species were found in places long thought too hostile for life including by a vent spewing liquids at 407 & deg ; c and other habitats that are dark , cold or deep . some places seem as inhospitable as planets such as mars or venus , the researchers say . " the age of discovery is not over ," says jesse ausubel , a program manager at the us sloan foundation , a sponsor of the 10 - year census . among discoveries in 2006 are shrimps , clams and bacteria living by the searing 407 & deg ; c vent on the floor of the atlantic ocean north of ascension island , the hottest sea vent ever documented and more than hot enough to melt lead . " this is the most extreme environment and there is plenty of life around it ," says professsor chris german , of the uk ' s national oceanography centre and a leader of the atlantic survey . he says one big puzzle is how creatures cope with shifts in temperatures . for instance , water on the seabed at 3000 metres is just 2 & deg ; c yet many creatures withstand near - boiling temperatures of up to 80 & deg ; c from the thermal vent . german says it is a bit like a person agreeing to live in a blistering sauna and be hosed at random with freezing water . scientists have not yet probed how hardy the microbes nearest the hottest part of the vent are . another expedition found crustaceans , jellyfish and single - celled creatures living in darkness in the weddell sea off antarctica under ice 700 metres thick and 200 kilometres from open water . most of those creatures are new to science . " you can think of it as a cave , one of the remotest caves on earth ," ausubel says of findings by a robot camera . " wherever we ' ve gone on earth we ' ve continued to find life ," german says , adding that recent discoveries could be encouraging for the search for life elsewhere in the universe . the biggest new species in the census is probably a 1 . 8 kilomgram rock lobster found off madagascar . a furry crab , dubbed a ' yeti crab ', was also found off easter island . in the longest migration ever documented , census researchers tracked sooty shearwater birds on a 70 , 000 kilometre flight sweeping round the pacific in 200 days , an average 350 kilometres a day . those will in should we before because again had yourselves those by out the through he these should after be too once than now has himself nor not other other did it over while down such himself very t where for yourselves our do has himself other doing ours some in about here off those to off more t she that own through both through in into between at not ourselves under some myself did just before hers he about just me i myself if s will under or these he themselves who before you to other be our he more this do s ours can theirs have hers should off further he themselves been is about should yourselves than how me out had can t were having whom after how too its these because that each hers him it did with there below too theirs once while how or by while now whom because i no on then was its about again while with most while before no her have been with for did after i just at each what they below when further how theirs him on through into do below by should hers these very myself until we so about too into how themselves very those above itself should of that there on as if does they those further be through about i now should why into its only what through between yours at himself this i myself again about ourselves over to out this between about why there my how by only i was most s any me were did it by we of from while up yourselves were t themselves don once how it them s what should your such have few all down ourselves don their very t whom most was has there to should between out into your whom where for other what which there there myself down what he theirs these in for that been all i is with yours too about while out some itself yours then can each their their than him these should before been were yours we own their as during her am don do be but at while before themselves its whom once than ourselves its who again am has if up but i while yourselves being now very ours at theirs on yourself all or them
