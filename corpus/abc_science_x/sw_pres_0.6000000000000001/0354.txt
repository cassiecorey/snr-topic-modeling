relationships , family and social standing are all sources of stress for female baboons - sound familiar ? female baboons get stressed about males and even suffer from premenstrual tension , a new study shows . according to the research , the number one cause of stress for female chacma baboons ( papio hamadryas ursinus ) is when a new male enters a group and may threaten to bully and kill other baboons , especially infants . " that suggests to me that females are highly aware of the risks presented by violent young males entering the troop ," says dr anne engh , lead author of the study , which was published recently in the journal animal behavior . engh , a researcher in the department of biology at the university of pennsylvania , and her team studied approximately 70 male and female baboons over a 16 - month period in botswana ' s moremi game reserve . they collected faecal samples from females for stress hormone analysis . prior research has found that glucocorticoids , a class of steroid hormones , rise when apes , humans and other animals feel stress . baboons get pmt too besides male immigration , reproductive state , predation , rank instability and infanticide also triggered female stress . the stress hormone rise during reproductive stages is normal , and indicates that female apes , like women , could experience a potentially cranky pmt phase . female baboons usually exist in stable , hierarchical groups , but the researchers observed two instances where low status females tried to pull rank and stress levels rose . in one case , an adult female , her adult daughter and a sister all attempted to usurp the power of another unit . after a week of fighting and high stress , the lower - ranked group gave up . in the second period of observed instability , an adult female named cat ran off with a high - ranked male for several days . when she returned , a " cat - fight " ensued with the other females . the fights not only lowered the status of cat , but also placed the unfortunate baboon ' s daughter , sisters , aunt and their children to the bottom of the hierarchy . " our best guess is that poor cat just had very bad timing ," engh says . " when she left the troop with the alpha male , more than half of the troop ' s females were cycling , so there was probably quite a bit of competition between the females to catch the alpha ' s eye ." anxiety levels also rose when males , attempting to assert their power , killed infants . for several days after an infant ' s murder , its mother would scream and flee whenever the killing male approached . what can baboons teach us about stress ? engh says friendships with less aggressive males and grooming with females seems to reduce the females ' fear and stress . professor joan silk , a university of california at los angeles anthropologist noted for her work on the evolution of social behaviour in primates , says she has worked at the same reserve where the new study took place , and that this " account seems consistent with what i know of the females there ." she says , " the results provide independent confirmation of the supposition that sociality has important consequences for females ." baboons in their natural habitat appear to cope with stress better than humans do , engh says . " humans , in contrast , get stressed out about many things , often things that are of little significance in our lives or are completely abstract threats ," she says . " we would probably be better off aping baboons and worrying only about the important things in our lives ." their so themselves up me at when then those only him himself myself just am did their herself once such him s had all will me my few theirs or after have ours an not each now you have the under with our am be nor until who very who should below at your myself not into s this me the are so you during itself against as too any being itself until theirs off myself its it having only ours that by me my but to because hers until these him he on was on both but herself its that yours him had our just can before because very your whom he their him is having the do his while am before itself after them to herself on from off through theirs which before them i off whom s only ours than yours do that as which for yourself own under any not these few own themselves both most its these some myself been each of hers own a that the that between his i why am their with from will but its theirs same he until as t its once has yourselves below you of am yours so his because very over these he if by where do its same who not some over here up that myself during if few while whom further for below did he nor more be about he into do do or for doing by you an had when but after what himself all but such into in against while is from my their an hers then how once was those once from while these during herself am but those why after you a has as me how we between our but no how her the our at yourselves s yourself there be very by we before the doing which under by again few were some yours other who when between been been she not all had are she because a t on out up those so here been an hers an only who on whom off each such further out their ourselves once our through herself the under other very my that a further having between will what ours did by does own herself of all myself do only so the between very not all his of herself against for your down our not myself the these as itself an or here doing should their is don s but is or up his below am more the whom which where than than to there own were this only whom most a myself or were being again had
