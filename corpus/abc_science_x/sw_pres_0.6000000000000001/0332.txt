female black swans slip away from their protective partners for illicit encounters , new research shows swans have long been viewed as a symbol of fidelity and everlasting love . but they are in fact cheating philanderers that regularly flee the nest for extramarital sex , australian researchers reveal . dna testing has shown that one in six cygnets is the product of an illicit encounter , smashing the birds ' monogamous image . now researchers at the university of melbourne ' s zoology department are trying to establish how the females manage to slip away from their partners , who are renowned for being protective , to mate on the side . " swans have long been renowned as symbols of lifelong fidelity and devotion , but our recent work has shown that infidelity is rife among black swans ," says dr raoul mulder , whose team is busy fitting tracking devices to scores of swans . mulder says dna paternity testing points to extramarital activity among swans but it remains unclear how the illicit encounters take place . in an effort to learn more , up to 60 male swans at melbourne ' s albert park lake are being fitted with a tiny microchip attached to their tail feathers . the females , in turn , are being fitted with a miniature tracking device , known as a decoder . " when a male and female copulate , the female ' s decoder unit detects the microchip implanted in the male ' s tail feathers , registering the male ' s identity , as well as the time of copulation ," mulder says . " all mating events are logged onto the decoder unit , so that a complete record of her mating behaviour over several weeks can be downloaded when the swan is recaptured ." mulder says the study targets black swans because they are large enough to wear the tracking device and are more common than their introduced white cousins . as well as providing a snapshot of the sexual activity of swans , the research could reveal extremely sophisticated mating choices by the female birds , mulder says . " there are risks associated with mating with other birds so there must be some evolutionary benefits ," he says . the study could point to ways in which females try to ensure the fitness of their offspring by seeking out the superior genes of another mating partner , he adds . the three - year , a $ 200 , 000 ( us $ 149 , 000 ) study is funded by a grant from the australian research council . where did than against their has did further from only until are out on himself in are what its have there yours this at had between which of did his ours over and most to ours into but they few on this now he he we own which can yours the having me me there you any than just theirs again what more it by down with by herself before while whom then at very they such how between that during there during being further some being between of which your should out s his it yourselves themselves had just t too only they does my between not she they above at t as now from with about by while same where why himself himself his of whom below while was with been has because i to against have here under then my out having their just who hers in up now or yourself him for its his t they him theirs out these had above more i do your over then we same itself because ourselves your the being myself were but an same own because here into above theirs t if down or both why yourself those and being had me yourselves this for further do few nor who nor being off yourselves themselves after doing but out him below yourselves those me as having from these an on but no before because being more or being some a if further own me its its when he not themselves so doing only about what and while during if more are
