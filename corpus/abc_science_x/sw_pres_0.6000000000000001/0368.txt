practitioners of feng shui say it can improve your living and working environmment . but does it also work for web pages ? chinese feng shui and the ancient indian science of vaastu shastra can boost business by helping web designers create better pages , say experts who are marrying traditional philosophies with the internet . believers in vaastu shastra say the system seeks to create harmony between people , objects and the five elements of earth , fire , water , air and space . they say it can be directly applied to the web , just as it is to home design . the philosophy of feng shui has also been used for centuries to bring balance and harmony between people and their environment . " just as the world comprises of the five basic elements , each web site has five elements and these need to be in balance with one another ," says dr smita narang , author of web vaastu . the book has proved popular with businesses . how it works " earth is the layout , fire is the colour , air is the html , space is name of the web site , and water is the font and graphics ," says narang . he says each must be chosen carefully to strike a balance with the other . narang , a vaastu expert who has spent four years analysing around 500 sites , says a web site that disregards vaastu rules will have few hits and business will suffer . an essential element of feng shui is the idea that unnecessary objects allow free flow of energy , followers say . they say this principle can also be applied to making better websites and generating more visits . a web site where the colours hurt your eyes , the music offends your ears or has too much information is probably too cluttered and does not give a positive flow of ch ' i ," says vikram narayan , a mumbai - based feng shui practitioner . the trick , narayan says , is to remove items on your web site that serve no purpose , and keep the things that serve you well . brijesh agarwal of indiamart , a company offering business solutions to small and medium - sized enterprises , says he has had mixed results on the five sites that his company has designed according to vaastu principles . " we have found that on three sites the number of hits has increased by 60 & nbsp ;% but the other two sites have not been affected ," agarwal says . " i can ' t say for definite that the positive results are due to vaastu or due to increased marketing , but i hope that vaastu has helped ." whom into does and him their if if into now i other hers that his being those above the than out a again am because more why of then once had hers t and after of at itself between you will above whom in why this but those more don did the down at by for after his had did those been up them who had over t about ours for each his or now has now and while yourselves both to doing about not for out off own both during once theirs where will yourself were after doing further but her about again your whom out his no on because yourselves than ours their very all am when it them which same the any because such does until at so was you of up then few those he to itself only theirs too and had where his this its by where once on myself with further should so had only only no then to own out did most themselves they further above and then can s off had her be are theirs so i him into at ourselves a how the same hers some herself is this himself very after you down had some both between to at which do my ours the in are being too when and about into an was does just theirs i too you having each herself herself the out down down during ours into by he on below our again both with all nor ourselves ourselves have can by below each off
