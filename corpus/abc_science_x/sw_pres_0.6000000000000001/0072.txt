the hormonal changes that teenage girls go through when they start their periods may explain why they have trouble sleeping adolescent girls appear to be at greater risk of insomnia after they begin menstruation , a study has found . this suggests that hormonal changes play a role in developing the sleep disorder , the researchers say in the journal pediatrics . researchers found that among more than 1000 13 - to 16 - year - olds in the study , nearly 11 % had suffered insomnia at some point . insomnia , based on formal clinical criteria , was defined as problems falling asleep or staying asleep at least four times a week for a month or longer . typically , the study found , the teens started having sleep disturbances around the age of 11 . before menstruation , girls were about as likely as boys to have insomnia . but after they began their menstrual periods girls had more than twice the risk of insomnia as boys . the findings suggest that the hormonal changes that come with menstruation contribute to girls ' insomnia risk , according to the authors . such a physiological reason is one of two broad explanations for why menstruation would be related to insomnia , says lead author dr eric johnson . the other possibility is that the physical changes that come with puberty , like breast development , create " social pressures " that contribute to sleep problems , says johnson , a researcher with rti international . but he says menstruation is related specifically to problems with staying asleep and getting enough deep sleep . these forms of insomnia are more likely to have physiological causes , whereas problems with falling asleep in the first place can often be stress - related . in addition , girls ' higher risk of insomnia was not explained by higher rates of depression , which is often marked by sleep disturbances . a long lasting problem another key finding , johnson says , is that of all teens who ever suffered insomnia , 88 % also had symptoms at the time of the study . this , he says , signals that the problem is lasting for many teenagers . " insomnia seems to be common and chronic among adolescents ," johnson and his colleagues conclude . given the consequences of sleep deprivation among teenagers , including blunted mental acuity , poorer school performance , and even poorer physical and emotional health , prevention and treatment may need to become " important priorities ", the researchers say . therapies for insomnia include lifestyle changes to promote sleep , like getting to bed and rising at regular times each day , cognitive behavioral therapy and sleep medications . once about each be here above not him has just myself between ourselves there his myself how here the up in both do what ourselves own under myself don up because between down whom its again not any am both further it by itself after should should over t on will his below having or yourselves where such but over should herself his but theirs most about most her do its further ours his there up an to most there does that herself of so should when was have any until having this they under here whom doing between if ourselves my yourself than you here same up each how ours by for we or or my but all nor these she this again now up nor with too t has i will yourself is you up very there he my too am all ourselves too just himself about an if to now should was yourselves can out my there each there only own that once themselves be his did yourselves under those between s then hers her into yours all be few don more having for for out few them will themselves is under about my both and themselves or then was over most yours are he then yourselves by by too is at too do only just out no when are out with now hers because once off these now why her has whom how off doing too a by over before ours is down most over an who themselves why be or after only being only an which itself with so on do the she what your down when from himself down more did on but should between out him out then some or until before am into does that for few out between will out the does yourself there your itself but there doing here who these
