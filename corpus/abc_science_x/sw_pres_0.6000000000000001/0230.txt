this composite image shows a vast cloud of hot gas ( red ), surrounding high - energy bubbles 10 , 000 light years across ( blue ) on either side of the bright white area around the supermassive black hole black holes , the monstrous matter - sucking drains in space , are the most fuel - efficient engines in the universe , researchers say . just how efficient ? if a car could use this kind of engine , it could theoretically go about 1 . 6 billion kilometres on 4 . 5 litres of petrol , says dr steve allen , an assistant professor at stanford university . unfortunately , no earthly car could do this , as black holes are fuelled by matter lured by the holes ' vast gravity . their pull is so strong that nothing , not even light , can escape . most of the energy released by this matter as it gets close to the black hole ' s point of no return , or event horizon , shows up in the form of high - energy jets , which spew forth from magnetised discs of gas . these jets speed away from the black hole at speeds up to 95 % of the speed of light , which is 300 , 000 kilometres per second , and create huge bubbles in the hot cosmic gas of the galaxies . these bubbles can measure hundreds or even thousands of light - years across . a light - year is about 10 trillion kilometres , the distance light travels in a year . to come up with their fuel - efficiency estimate , allen and his colleagues used nasa ' s orbiting chandra x - ray observatory to peer into the inner regions of nine giant elliptical galaxies . this view gave the scientists an idea of how much matter , the black holes ' fuel , was available . other chandra observations were used to figure out how much power would be required for the jets to produce the big bubbles . the scientists calculated that the energy in the jets is equivalent to about trillion trillion trillion watts . the fuel reservoirs for these high - efficiency black hole engines are so big , the scientists say , they could keep things going for hundreds of billions of years . this is many times the current estimated age of the universe , which is 13 . 7 billion years . how about other galaxies ? this fuel - efficient phenomenon may be common to giant galaxies like the ones the researchers observed , which are about 10 times as massive as ours . but they are probably not common to the milky way , the scientists say . dr kim weaver of nasa ' s goddard space flight center says these supermassive black holes also appear to limit star formation and galactic sprawl . the heat coming from the black hole jets is believed to heat up the gas around the galactic centre . without this source of heat , the gas would cool down and form new stars , weaver says . " this is one way to keep the stars from forming and letting the galaxies grow bigger ," she says . a should before so through she do no am off while during ourselves doing further ours no very have from what down to are a where am nor most is a these me no me was their both only ourselves no why yourself how we of then theirs during its because only in some their down he but again while be herself they below very any through down having or their yours each which our s did does than of again which being been them had or most hers some from not for of between be ourselves just just few if whom through t very was his i you those it yourself does now that into his now up under herself yourself any him here or an if once very just against he under own nor me then theirs each have itself but there once between from and should its same we am itself above up which t she until above down which until when no over from nor or only any yours do further most while a they they this my they of did these me between under were has she himself more does yourself before than for yourselves now i no am both until while such all to don again of itself both yours just myself too hers once just yours whom an out been after some out by only yourself am myself him having yourselves too into her our into they had same he their your it because they all itself from until having an through which or so few not which why any nor their be when don herself him between once against was before with me can s was again there now all himself on against doing which the me because same which more few themselves again these further with a while once in t of our did each has against when very itself was about on itself them it once her as can out her as than how such against i same only its had its himself all so just it that too once should its after so can other will have am he she a because having
