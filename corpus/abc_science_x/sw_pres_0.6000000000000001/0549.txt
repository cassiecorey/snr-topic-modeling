the double - pulsar system put einstein ' s theory of general relativity through its paces , with what ' s believed to be the most stringent test yet pulses of radiation emitted from a pair of distant stars have confirmed that einstein ' s theory of general relativity is at least 99 . 95 % right , scientists say . an international research team including scientists working at australia ' s parkes telescope measured the radiation from a ' double pulsar ' system 2000 light - years away to put the theory through its paces . according to results published online today in the journal science , the 91 - year - old theory came through with top marks . " general relativity has passed all our tests ," says co - author dr george hobbs from the australia telescope national facility . the double pulsar system , called psr j0737 - 3039a and b , consists of two highly compact neutron stars , each of which weighs more than our own sun but measures only about 20 kilometres across . the two stars whirl around each other at a million kilometres an hour , emitting lighthouse - like beams of radio waves . researchers used three of the world ' s largest radio telescopes , the uk ' s lovell telescope at jodrell bank , the parkes radio telescope and the robert c byrd green bank telescope in west virginia in the us , to observe those beams over a period of three years . their measurements offered a number of ways to test the accuracy of the theory of general relativity . the most precise is called the shapiro delay , and concerns einstein ' s prediction that massive objects warp space - time . " einstein says that the whole concept of space and time are connected and that gravitational fields warp both of them ," explains hobbs . this means that when one pulsar passes behind the other , its signal travels through the warped space - time created by the one in the foreground . using einstein ' s theory , the researchers calculated that this warping would add a 90 microsecond delay to the arrival of the signal on earth , which is just what their measurements found . " the first thing to say is that the prediction and the measurement agree ," hobbs says . " but it isn ' t possible for our measurement to be 100 % precise ." what the scientists can say for certain is that einstein ' s theory is accurate to at least within 0 . 05 %. " general relativity is used in astronomy all the time , on the assumption that it is correct ," says hobbs . " this is the most stringent test ever made of it in the presence of a very strong gravitational field ." should a t there each was doing if themselves it itself his most him she did other am until they has now no what have into just while through who s while by what me ourselves no over don there an after on just him own other these from it is itself the doing further these no of of about having between against s who each for when any under we there between about its the for out you against she above their itself few who s same why or further its each between am then who where me above each ourselves be few or whom this herself not if s there the themselves are some this yourselves their most having over she ourselves my their is whom not both he ourselves have been and me were some here nor is while just very there nor from more what under too herself so other why when his in before they herself her there i they having more between other them we own no below himself is than these be against so me these just just than most between each until hers t should t because between doing no what by by himself hers through t me he theirs into through she so from when against her against theirs them theirs before in this very most after few where its doing yourselves too as t here will between her off both more an each by other if has ours for him only for below my hers doing t are doing me against himself so hers ours his own more has was at his them what before am each and itself any they has as until just about her any same
