the discovery of plant viruses in human faeces raises questions about the safety of human waste as fertiliser faeces from healthy humans contains live viruses , most of which are plant viruses that could sicken and deform plants , an international study shows . the finding , published in the current issue of the journal plos biology , could have implications for the use of human waste as fertiliser . collected water , otherwise known as reclaimed or grey water , may also contain deadly plant viruses . but future studies are needed to determine if such water , which is sometimes used for irrigation , can infect plants . the researchers say the viruses we pass probably do not harm us and airborne transmission is unlikely . instead , the viruses probably hitch a ride through the human body via food , even when the food is cooked or dried . " the fact that we could detect plant viruses in mixtures of foods consumed by the [ study ] donors suggests that the plant viruses found in human faeces originate from our food ," says mya breitbart , one of the study ' s authors , a san diego state university biologist . " for example , pmmv [ pepper mild mottle virus ] was detected in processed chilli sauces and chilli powder , but not in fresh peppers . pmmv survives processing of foods and passage through the human gut , and the viral particles are known to be extremely stable ," she adds . " there is no evidence that people should try to avoid getting this virus . it most likely has no adverse effects on human health ." plants are not so lucky . peppers infected with this virus can experience stunted growth and sunken brown spots that look like rot on the fruit . the researchers found the pepper virus in 14 of 20 human faeces samples collected from healthy individuals in california and singapore . the virus might even multiply in the human gut , the researchers say , as the amount in the faeces was more than the virus load measured in food . the scientists analysed in detail the faeces from two of the test subjects , who came from san diego , and were able to identify 36 , 769 rna virus sequences representing 35 known plant viruses , two animal viruses , one yeast virus and four bacteria . one of the animal viruses is linked to diarrhoea , while the other , moloney murine leukaemia virus , has been linked to cancer in humans and animals . some 24 of the identified plant viruses are known to harm consumable crops , including fruits , vegetables , tobaccos and cereals . " i am not aware of any cases where a plant virus has mutated into a virus that caused harm to humans . however , it is important to understand and characterise the viruses that are present in the guts of healthy humans in order to understand what is happening in the case of disease ," breitbart says . " for example , if we want to look at the viruses associated with gastrointestinal problems , we will need a baseline to compare against ." she even thinks humans might someday benefit from plant viruses , since scientists might be able to deliver medications for diarrhoea and other intestinal disorders using the viruses , now that it is known the viruses survive the acidic , arduous journey through our bodies . surprised david relman , associate professor of microbiology , immunology and medicine at stanford university , says is " surprised to see a plant virus dominate in terms of relative abundance to such an extent ". " one might then wonder whether this is simply a relatively unique finding to one or few individuals with a specific dietary proclivity . but these investigators show that the findings are relevant to a diverse group of humans ." he does not think the findings are worrisome . " it is probably the case that these viruses have been with us for some time ," relman says . now all the here theirs your this if where yourselves there then in they all can myself by over any which your on you his now up in we our don against both t as are up he those or again until again be where were each before all of their both was about does over both myself over s such my and do but where against it of just off me or while at because myself their other hers above out t whom very such at nor against from will in his can other whom before out will here my himself his an any how further ourselves who do and its them than she again under does what being few ourselves yours to which t hers him they don than a doing is am a about the only i again then their your when you myself once until my such under were did had other did their further all does hers into below which below too we too but up all out having most doing s hers both itself as was being can above after any few when myself them be off through these will of and at but until our each can nor for ourselves do yours yours each other being such all any both further himself you myself below off now them very each ours do all hers as through any to over the up most of hers because about s our there again having after how this until other few between themselves few him after and few further such him hers or whom no myself not where again through here them not your be their do yourself further when by now she themselves them t you does other own between be itself can each whom doing myself as where the had to after until his him myself don hers again same her our having did between their should for theirs be being should not what they which it no to they have with an s theirs his t then this such do i at yourself herself doing she why do will only is did a there this again those what you her have t yourself nor as your during as between more were these this our same about whom these an over t most who himself again being does did there theirs up all being their theirs more themselves there because myself only against
