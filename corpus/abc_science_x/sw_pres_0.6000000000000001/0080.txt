the search for life on other planets is homing in on a handful of solar systems that resemble our own . but not everyone agrees this is the best approach astronomers looking for extraterrestrial life now have a short list of places to point their telescopes . they include nearby stars of the right size , age and composition to have earth - like planets circling them , scientists say . but cuts in us federal funding mean that private philanthropists , who pay for the bulk of their work , may find out first when and if extraterrestrial life is discovered , the astronomers told a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science . dr margaret turnbull of the carnegie institution of washington released her top 10 list of potential stars to the meeting . they will be the first targets of nasa ' s terrestrial planet finder , a system of two orbiting observatories scheduled for launch by 2020 . " there are 400 billion stars in the galaxy , and obviously we ' re not going to point the terrestrial planet finder ... at every one of them ," says turnbull . so , on behalf of nasa and the now independently funded search for extraterrestrial intelligence , or seti , she narrowed down the list to stars that could have planets with liquid water orbiting them . " we want to see these habitable planets with our own eyes ," she adds . so the star cannot be too bright , or it will obscure the planet . variable stars , which grow hotter and cooler , probably would not be conducive to life , so they are thrown out , as are stars that are too young or too old . some are too gassy to have spawned planets like earth , which contains a lot of metal . others have massive companions whose gravity could interfere with the steady conditions needed for life to evolve . top 10 list turnbull ' s top 10 list includes 51 pegasus , where in 1995 swiss astronomers spotted the first planet outside our solar system , a jupiter - like giant . others include 18 sco in the scorpio constellation , which is very similar to the sun ; epsilon indi a , a star one - tenth as bright as the sun ; and alpha centauri b , part of the closest solar system to our own . " the truth is when looking at these so - called ' habstars ', habitable solar systems , it is hard to really rank them . i don ' t know enough about every star to say which one is the absolute best one ," turnbull says . but dr carol cleland of the university of colorado argues that astronomers are limiting themselves by looking for planets that closely resemble earth . " i actually think we ought to be looking for life as we don ' t know it ," cleland says . she says life on earth is all so similar , based on dna made up of specific building blocks , that it is likely to have had a single origin . life elsewhere may be built from different ingredients , or structured very differently , she says . feeling the pinch dr jill tarter of the seti institute , set up after us government funding for the program was cut , says the current budget threatens other astronomical programs . she says research and analysis budgets were cut by 15 % in the fiscal year 2007 budget proposed this year by us president george w bush . " in the case of astrobiology , the cut is to 50 % of what it was in 2005 ," tarter says . " we are facing what we consider an extraordinarily difficult financial threat ." she says nasa once had a policy of what to do , who to call , and how to announce the news if someone detected a signal of intelligent life from space . " today it is in fact a group of very generous philanthropists who will get the call before we get a press conference ," tarter says . they include microsoft co - founder paul allen and microsoft chief technology officer nathan myhrvold . during he while will will am myself how herself own his before while does myself am just those have her them ours on between ourselves and am or same who them up t is do been be about did do at then should during theirs did themselves why up but were same a those s ourselves itself under not they up yours he were a yourselves again those its up very himself has your him few yourselves this is she own just don yours only until few below off above its it other me your very some those over than was very i are not as am i were of until up them no an theirs between about what s been been ourselves than few yourself into until until its where why only now while does will up because each why whom those than your down between ourselves all itself who theirs few me yourselves s once once were am ourselves about doing some during both himself am other which t again between all these itself been him under themselves because t him how how do such for own am they myself from its whom further at some himself once once by be its now below most off between do will s if when were both over once there them nor theirs herself just himself having he have has or on because very nor my to themselves my did your am more was were now them very have to can whom s down same too then for no more to some she too these yours again above through am because then who has yourself then t over yourselves their in there further out no ourselves during before down through of as you how our below for as or or once other during should itself above him after so there so theirs t while down this yourselves if their until had ours from hers few into yourselves i have there themselves whom myself myself having me him his don further this his am during my but until why these a in they whom doing that can their yours any was they these here off did yourselves whom both will his then each if
