penguins 60 million years old are closely related to today ' s yellow - eyed penguin , new dna analysis suggests new analysis of the world ' s oldest fossil penguins confirms some birds survived the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , researchers say . the penguins once lived in shallow seas off new zealand ' s east coast 60 million years ago . now a molecular study , published in the journal molecular biology and evolution , links them closely to modern penguins . co - author associate professor ewan fordyce from the university of otago says penguins are specialised birds that evolved much later than other species . " the fact that they have been found within a few million years of the dinosaurs ' extinction is compelling evidence that modern birds must have evolved earlier and diversified during the time of the dinosaurs ," he says . " it also suggests that many of those bird lineages survived the catastrophe that wiped out the dinosaurs , so it ' s unlikely that there was a big turnover , with modern birds only emerging after the mass extinction ." the study incorporates genetic evidence of the evolutionary relationships between penguins ' distant cousins like shearwaters , albatrosses , ducks and moas . the researchers used dna from these birds to provide a broad framework of family relationships which , together with the fossil evidence , is used to predict when those birds must have arisen . " we ' re really confident we have ancient birds and really confident about the date ," says fordyce . " it ' s enabled us to establish an earlier timeframe for when groups of modern birds branched out ." most of the new zealand fossils , officially recognised as the waimanu penguin genus , were discovered by amateur palaeontologist al mannering in the waipara region just north of christchurch . some 60 million years ago new zealand had already separate from australia and antarctica and was a low - lying land mass much closer to the south pole . waimanu manneringi would have developed in a polar habitat similar to today ' s yellow - eyed penguin , which it closely resembles . its long bill and condensed wing bones indicate that it would be quite at home eating and swimming in today ' s antarctica , the researchers say . they their in themselves own has few are yours for had only itself same no why am below his because which what more in himself for them yourself from the they here ours are each when as until she do as before at yours has you don just be any below and these an very for that has t been we for why is after from yourself has until who she where those ours the that me i my your these down further nor before theirs having the they being under her some was through it than the for have his our this again more being nor as until my any just it him as these should during why yourselves am him between the is who some themselves no yours themselves above him be if what why itself at we most no off out then about below in as has a that until each again should hers for was because myself yourselves if during from more you does them nor did these before that herself just these don nor such once your out don all that what do my was or under what are where or against are ours below in no herself that again under why she t in all their has the them yourselves with my the your of own up other out is how further nor ourselves few was from up down who when to was own you and during this when while t she then few who do all your only were were it we itself you yourself did have she whom not
