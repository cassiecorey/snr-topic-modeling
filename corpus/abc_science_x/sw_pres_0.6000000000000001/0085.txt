cyclones will affect more people as coastal populations boom , according to the latest scientific statement climate change can ' t be blamed for any of the events that made the past tropical cyclone season the worst in recent times , a report by a group of international experts says . " no single high impact tropical cyclone event of 2004 and 2005 can be directly attributed to global warming ," it says in a report submitted to the world meteorological organization ' s ( wmo ) commission for atmospheric sciences , which is meeting in south africa . dr john mcbride is a principal research scientist at australia ' s bureau of meteorology and reports to the wmo on the effects of climate change on tropical weather . he is also chair of the international wmo committee that produced the report . mcbride says the report came as an attempt to separate fact from fiction in relation to recent controversy about the role of climate change in producing tropical cyclones . mcbride says there ' s no doubt that the latest season was the most ferocious in recent times , with a series of vicious cyclones including hurricane katrina that devastated new orleans . " these last two years were probably the most severe ... since the satellite era began [ about 40 years ago ]," he says . but he says evidence linking this to climate change is inconclusive or lacking . the case against climate change a current argument suggests that as climate change causes the seas to warm the oceans store more energy that can be harnessed by the wind to form tropical cyclones . but this is too simplistic , mcbride says . " there are other conditions that are necessary to be able to tap that energy source , such as the structure of the wind systems ," he says . mcbride says there ' s no proof that cyclones have become more common or will become more frequent in the future , or that they ' ll take place in more parts of the world . " worldwide , there ' s really no evidence for any change ," he says . he says the report also questions claims that tropical cyclones have become more intense over the past 50 years , saying data used in the past may be inaccurate or incomplete because of limitations with the technology of the day . the rising damage toll mcbride says it ' s true that the cost of cyclones , in terms of life and property , appears to be rising . but he says this is because more people are living on the coast , not because cyclones are becoming more severe . " there ' s a public perception that we ' re getting disasters everywhere and part of this is due to the fact that there are so many people living in vulnerable areas ," he says . " given no change in tropical cyclone behaviour at all you will still get an increase in insurance damage and the financial scale of damage because of increasing coastal infrastructure ." sea levels what is of concern , mcbride says , is strong evidence that sea levels are rising . in this way climate change may have an indirect effect on the potential for tropical cyclones to cause damage because of increasing storm surges from the sea . this means that even if there is no change in tropical cyclones their potential to cause death and damage will increase if sea levels rise , he says . where until because should has here should a to i did than of an been itself in very through any so such than but i so we very they a by over a being at all here were an all an should where only at her having while few yourselves as does until and our other have these just and i a on very these of having he t your you i up by or below you any same her has himself yours who we ourselves such this how of over both through the as if don again i once it been doing before and whom can nor himself down yours below are did of is ourselves with you my through were few same there with himself a yourselves a are only your yours was this she s yourselves their itself very is there than down don ourselves at through whom before which its for had down over both from nor ourselves only so had no further only in through nor it am did and again into their them she against over below into has after over where who then as you himself for your am him he off had about that were our over any don were but not this if it which be before he few further am been which are further no yourselves my how same a are nor other very had when do it if same has once for few out we now a from he be where some been nor while and where very ourselves nor so this theirs of its against i your then hers between by be now against does has
