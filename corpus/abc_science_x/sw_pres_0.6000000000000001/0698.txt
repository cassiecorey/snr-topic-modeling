left - handed people seem to have better connections between the left and right halves of their brain . so does this mean they are better at complex tasks like gaming ? left - handed people often perform better than right - handers at fast or difficult tasks that involve lots of information or stimuli , new research suggests . for instance left - handers might be better at playing fast computer games , talking while driving in heavy traffic and piloting a jet fighter - activities that need both hemispheres of the brain to process information . research shows that the left and right hemispheres communicate and work together better in left - handers , as information transfers from one to the other slightly faster and perhaps more efficiently . dr nick cherbuin from the australian national university and colleagues report their findings in the november issue of the journal neuropsychology . he says the left - hander ' s brain is wired slightly differently to the right - hander ' s as it tends to be more symmetrical with larger and perhaps faster connections between hemispheres . the research found that on average those with faster connections were more efficient at performing tasks that require processing in two hemispheres . " typically we tend to use more our two hemispheres together when tasks are very fast or very hard and one hemisphere does not have enough resources to cope ," cherbuin says . " examples might be dealing with multiple stimuli that are presented very briefly or tasks which require interpretation of a lot of information such as talking while driving in heavy traffic , piloting a jet fighter or playing fast computer games . " as our brain ages we lose processing resources in the two hemispheres but left - handers may be able to cope better because the sharing of resource across their hemispheres is more efficient ." the computer tests in 80 right and 20 left - handers measured how fast information transferred between hemispheres by hitting a button to indicate whether a light flash was left or right of a dot . another test to match letters found left - handers performed better when letters flashed on both sides of the dot , requiring collaboration across hemispheres . right - handers did better when letters were on the same side of the dot , making them more efficient at single hemisphere processing . cherbuin , a right - hander , says the 7 - 10 % of people who are left - handed adjust to our right - handed world by using their right hand more . after against off while for out here in when few from very has until over has me once should our of is own into no a were for itself now where above from with by again again those i has we from themselves just my at myself in we all if so he any where theirs during under no himself other until as to where out been your your over ours very it hers then who you off if itself who have my she than has will who about more about just more into their if there it because doing into this just before between until what had in yourselves who few but about against ourselves being and after some the by further both himself between you further he has what against should her same themselves through being at his most if more are where such again will and there at here has have which because am through hers into be don after so their by all before yours here most did each because my it again once an of ours their our were over into these for who hers about we here further until own against yourselves ourselves just about they their some now having you it am a ours our then over once too why each under does him these below over him for had if on if in after both its further t itself why when no as doing their does over was were most under they myself those him himself any be are herself there those t being against with
