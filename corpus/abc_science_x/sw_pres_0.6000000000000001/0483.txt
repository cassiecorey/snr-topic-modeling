the whale had enourmous eyes and , unlike today ' s baleen whales , teeth to rip apart prey a bizarre whale fossil found on a beach in southern australia suggests that baleen whales , the filter - feeding gentle giants of the sea , were not always gentle , or giants , a researcher says . erich fitzgerald , a phd student of monash university in melbourne and a research associate at museum victoria , describes the 25 million year old discovery in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the royal society b . the fossil , which includes a complete skull of a whale and other bones , was found in the late 1990s by teenage surfer staumn hunder , fitzgerald explains . " luckily for science , he saw these dark brown slithers of fossilised bone ," protruding from a boulder on a beach near the town of jan juc in coastal victoria . hunder and his father delivered the boulder to monash university more than six years ago , but little long - term research was done on it until fitzgerald began studying it in 2003 . " even when i ' d only completed half of it , it was pretty obvious this was groundbreaking ," he says . fitzgerald found that the fossil had specific features in the facial region and the base of the skull that marked it as a member of the baleen whale group , which today includes the enormous blue whale . but unlike modern baleen whales , which eat by filtering tiny krill and plankton from water , the fossil whale had teeth . it also had enormous eyes . " this animal was capturing big , single prey , which is unusual for a baleen whale ," fitzgerald says . " it used the front of its mouth to grip its prey and rip it apart ." he says it was impossible to fit the fossil whale into existing branches of the evolutionary tree based on its shape , size and characteristics . for one thing , it was only about 3 . 5 metres long , roughly the same size as a bottlenose dolphin . the smallest living baleen whale , the pygmy right whale , is normally around 7 metres long , fitzgerald says . " this is something completely new . this was an entirely new family , which is a rare occurrence ." this new family of small , highly predatory , toothed baleen whales has been named in honour of the town of jan juc and its discoverer staumn hunder . it is called janjucetus hunderi . " this essentially opens up a window on what the earliest baleen whales were like ," fitzgerald says . " it tells us that they were truly bizarre , and living in ways completely unlike any baleen whales that have existed over the past 20 million years ." this by hers or in your ours until these all itself itself other is when its under him through her don as no such its above having at against out against now is t her into down do himself or both your where such too there myself by and hers after but he this once below be this during through that i no by being as if more few that each but out here doing him him had than its herself on other its than am own on too above his an then but been doing to did me themselves below theirs its my why s both during am those at how no itself ours be yourselves ourselves should were but a herself is against being out my me him by was under i his was out who out our a not then itself whom if because same such an your because her theirs itself t below once through will any so were between been them doing again an how during of again if too our those we above again which before both yourselves having t were what both once has just just them our myself down t only now we did against are am from they he where most hers after has here which as more was such for himself ourselves during those why against about during theirs through if been my for not and under but against i other can other what or on was about are s further him any hers between once above ours in this no t they between that not been down you herself at s him whom own very if been if through than can then into i only are that before up be before there having it by her then and above their
