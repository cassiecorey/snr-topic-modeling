a vending machine containing a new type of printer could churn out a novel in an instant an innovative printer head may lead to affordable printers that spew out a thousand pages per minute , its developers say . such printers could lead to fast , high - quality photo printing as well as on - demand printed media , say the researchers . imagine customised newspapers and magazine and instant books printed by a vending machine . " think of such a machine in an airport terminal . you slide your credit card , chose a [ book ] for your flight , and get it warm from the printer in less than a minute ," says dr moshe einat , senior lecturer at the college of judea and samaria in ariel , israel , and team member . the jetrix printer head , invented by colleague nissim einat and team , could be on the market in two years in printers costing u $ 500 - u $ 1000 , the researchers say . the machine could reduce backups at the office printer too . today , even the best printers used for business purposes cost thousands of dollars and max out at about 50 pages per minute . the speed is limited , in part , by the printer head . for starters , it ' s usually much smaller than the page and takes time to scan back and forth while applying the ink . nozzle redesign the other challenge has to do with the nozzles . the ink is typically pooled in a main reservoir and distributed through a chamber , or manifold , that has many branching tubes , each leading to a nozzle . to get uniform drops , the pressure of the ink in this system must be precisely regulated and maintained , a delicate task that becomes more difficult as the number of nozzles and the size of the nozzle array increases . overcoming obstacles the jetrix overcomes conventional limitations in two ways . first , it does not have a main reservoir or manifold that requires delicate pressure maintenance . second , it is not limited by size . in fact , it can be as large as piece of paper and theoretically has a nozzle for every pixel . the difference has to do with the way einat and his team built the printer head . they turned to the same technology used to manufacture computer chips , etching the printer head out of silicon wafer chips . instead of a small array of nozzles that makes many scans to print a page , the design is a flat , 2d panel designed to be as big as the page and eject all of the necessary ink simultaneously . although the approach has a number of innovative features , it also has limitations says dr ross allen , an internationally recognised technologist based in st helena , california , who has 40 patents in imaging and printing technology . " inkjet print heads typically make two to eight passes over the same pixel row in order to hide any defects caused by nozzles that don ' t operate or meet drop ejection specifications ," says allen . " if einat ' s print head lays down all of the ink at once , the printed page could show artefacts or flaws from ' bad ' nozzles ." printing in colour printing in colour could also present a challenge . " you ' ll need black , cyan , magenta and yellow page - size print heads printing in precise registration ," says allen . finally , he says , no matter how fast a printer head applies ink , it doesn ' t get around the basic limitation that the ink must dry before the page is stacked in the paper tray . will do you are him an yours were he up own and these doing not under itself these where had having she here at ours is my our your herself them as more again through should while to too who while them other some are again has up which only until same that because few other don ourselves my so am nor who am doing about that both now having just now against off theirs no those why below both s very only those for now be just with her any or why yourself she it about again because itself why why being those same between just who do where they where did ours against did your now was above can should so can most ourselves any have all of can very on nor he were myself then will all does further me he she out t itself had when yours about will its its into am and from their over both and most can i me any his his such she your the there the just a yourself which my can by only as will the very under here all were up doing is which into so me all having he a before there during some their hers through here are when when on your yours him by be theirs just am those these to am no my will down then too ours i if they too of after you during but now s having them all or again doing so until is if their further such did you his she this for hers be during what who an and up out ours all ours himself herself themselves few or further for been herself as my had than had with once so just on below doing over yours yourselves into above most such herself can or most down not the ourselves once if has did with they when about are only being an where will why too yours only they ourselves while in our your its that all about is same and over who here himself theirs why whom their who am but did s did have other my through no same have themselves nor just me if down our myself whom an very their for ours with had over them both or each or theirs a to hers when should whom yourselves by if him t
