the turtles are an important source of protein for aboriginal people and children are taught to hunt them from an early age feral pigs are threatening the northern snake - necked turtle population in arnhem land to the point where the species could become extinct in some areas , australian researchers predict . in a single experiment , feral pigs killed 96 % of radio - tracked turtles in a monitored area within a three - month period . " they dig them up like truffles ," says phd candidate damien fordham , of the university of canberra , whose research will be published in the journal biological conservation . fordham says while the turtles are found across northern australia , the consequences of extinction for the local indigenous population would be " extreme ". northern snake - necked turtles have traditionally provided an important seasonal source of protein for indigenous communities in arnhem land . not only would indigenous communities lose a valuable source of bush tucker , but with it the strong cultural ties they have with the turtle . fordham and colleagues mounted tiny radio tracking devices to the shells of 40 snake - necked turtles around waterholes in indigenous land around maningrida , 450 kilometres east of darwin . turtles aestivate , or dig themselves into the mud , to escape heat and lack of water during the late dry season , anywhere between august to december . of the 28 recorded turtle deaths during the 12 - week period , 27 were attributed to feral pigs . researchers believe feral pigs could have stumbled upon , and then eaten , some of the turtles while they were rooting around billabongs in search of morsels such as water chestnut . but it was clear that in 11 of 27 turtle deaths the pigs had specifically located and dug them up . generally , pigs make a huge mess at they root around looking for food , but researchers noted relatively undisturbed areas around the 11 turtle deaths , indicating a direct ' hit '. " this is disturbing as it indicates that pigs actively seek out and prey on aestivating turtles ," fordham says . the researchers predict more turtles will die as the feral pig population increases . mathematical modelling of how many turtles survive in the year of the study , if carried across all years , could led to distinction of the turtles in the region , the researchers note . researchers say the turtle ' s best hope for survival is a few years of good rainfall , when pig predation rates are low . fordham would also like to see government funding to ' fence in ' turtle - rich areas . a whom have for during be again they now this was only any here all his most my were they them other we me having himself does which were under after what theirs they between if most yourself only those them him more just she are ours was after this only most over when on theirs its about hers had below what have those at should doing off was to all t by did you an off it again any over other in did what do who those have before we of more too who yourselves against his further this with this all again as now most hers them that had were other myself an me above those theirs them being further the were who having your some why her under up same don how ours after can no few but between themselves did himself it were hers over about than during after was between than into out off my few further by until he i a now herself own ours what not because through do most ourselves over yourselves to most now an hers she been which same who over why very very into whom this which until more she yourself we yours in is the why again some yourselves himself him do as from there his down yourself have and once yourself against my now their once down yours now should are can will own should down myself each before out was down being do this a both until my under as into they before about above down can if having no where our me very yours myself above you once her further me but what about on we had above t myself once between a then because t there ourselves through a their any where these hers does this below as so whom
