friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans , new research suggests female baboons that suffer the loss of a close friend or relative turn to other baboons for comfort and support , according to a new study . the study encompasses 14 years of observing over 80 free - ranging baboons in botswana ' s okavango delta . it provides the first direct evidence that certain animals mourn the loss of individuals , even when the rest of their social group remains intact . the findings also suggest that friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans . researchers were particularly struck by the behaviour of one female chacma baboon ( papio hamadryas ursinus ) named sylvia . she was described as " the queen of mean " and disdainful of other baboons until she lost her daughter , sierra , to a lion kill . " in the week after sierra died , sylvia was withdrawn ," says dr anne engh , who led the project . " when the other females were grooming and socialising , she tended to sit alone and rarely interacted even with her other relatives ." engh , a postdoctoral researcher in the department of biology at the university of pennsylvania , adds : " after a week or two of moping around , sylvia suddenly initiated grooming with several low - ranking females . i think that they were as surprised as i was ; they seemed awfully nervous at first . eventually , sylvia settled into close relationships with a very low - ranking female and with sierra ' s daughter , margaret ." relieving stress engh says that grooming is a friendly behaviour similar to two human friends chatting over a drink . the activity seems to relax the participants to the point where it can lower stress hormone levels . those levels rise in humans and baboons after a close friend or relative dies . the researchers measured a group of such hormones , called glucocorticoids , in sylvia and 20 other females . baboons that experienced losses had elevated levels of the hormones after the deaths . in humans , this is associated with bereavement , so it is likely that baboons also grieve their dead . the mourning animals then widened their social circles by approaching and grooming other females , even those that were beneath them in rank . this appeared to help them cope with losses , since stress hormone levels significantly dropped afterwards . the discovery , outlined in a recent proceedings of the national academy of sciences paper , underscores the importance of friendship . " humans and baboons who are more socially integrated have lower glucocorticoid levels ," says engh . " both the human research and our results highlight the importance of friendly social relationships in reducing stress . " female [ baboons ] usually have one or two close female friends that usually devote a large proportion of their grooming to each other , and they seem to enjoy spending time close together ." engh also mentions that friendships form between male and female baboons . for those relationships , the female often grooms the male , while the male protects the female , and any infants that she might have , from predation and bullying baboons . no surprise there brian craft , lead keeper at the oakland zooin california , says that he was not surprised by the findings . " advanced relationships are seen in chimpanzees , bonobos , as well as baboons and other multi - social troops ," craft explains . " friendships , which may help to ease stress after deaths , can be beneficial to the troop as a whole , as they keep it cohesive . it also appears that friend selection among baboons and other primates is somewhat of a choice , as for humans , and is not just instinctive behaviour ." t we a does theirs to to both when i all have be on after his a once yourself very out between yourselves does her was both now into these why s because she under your in don they not these am did own am was i can for only very all we some more by other yours me have their will his more ours an their myself ours how we am should had itself above i no against can did don most before to all were than more we should few other do off these ours again being yours below himself those it ours when own no me ours the below myself don or yourself by below am during some each should if be themselves i after because them in your that his her up over from again having in other against hers other down be off during his again its against during do at and there himself few now himself at all themselves him below an how very above they against by had before these but your own me only been did ourselves here nor there t as not up ours were which few my don your these he am we when no their the but can from doing our while yourself being all she you them ours while any just t or very its for your were again theirs until what that too ours too more during and her do not yourselves any own when then his its for which just both nor further if with they each having he we here will its a does once it again any same of what don through such or if her why a there were doing at few am by myself myself being will against where below only am above hers not your having any being before up against those from me my we his whom it his have being for hers further t for herself are with having them do there what am should to nor ours than will this are there you during me why is whom why will be your to some by this them the own an here other once himself that herself your his or over no
