this owlet nightjar is one of the species found in the ' lost world ' of west papua , a world where animals show no fear of humans the lost world largely untouched by humans that was recently unearthed on west papua may be the last such find on earth , an expedition scientist says . his comments follow the discovery of a world teeming with new species , giant flowers and rare wildlife showing no fear of humans . australian , us and indonesian scientists , led by conservation international ( ci ), say they found the 300 , 000 - hectare paradise in the foja mountains of the indonesian - controlled province during an expedition late last year . the local kwerba and papasena people , who are customary landowners of the forest , acted as guides and naturalists . " the first bird i saw when i got out of the helicopter turned out to be a new species of honeyeater ," says team member kris helgen . the bird was an orange - faced honeyeater , a bird with a bright orange face - patch . helgen , who is completing a phd under dr tim flannery of the south australian museum , says the honeyeater is the first new species of bird found in new guinea since 1940 . " seeing that as the first bird was the clue that we were onto something big ," he says . the team also captured the first photos of the male berlepsch ' s six - wired bird of paradise ( parotia berlepschi ) in its natural habitat . this bird was one of a number first collected in the late 19th century by indigenous hunters and sent to victorian england where it was described as being of " unknown location ". several subsequent expeditions failed to find the bird . " it ' s definitely an area of great biological novelty ," says helgen . " there are lots of things found in these mountains that are found nowhere else ." the team took the first photos of the golden - fronted bowerbird ( amblyornis flavifrons ) displaying at its bower , a tower of twigs and other forest materials it builds for the mating ritual . the bowerbird , like the bird of paradise , had been collected in victorian times but no one knew where it came from . in 1979 , university of california ' s , professor jared diamond was the first to demonstrate that the foja mountains was the true homeland of the bowerbird . a lost world helgen says while diamond made observations of a number of birds in the foja mountains , he did not collect data or specimens . " we were the first to mount the true scientific expedition ," he says . helgen says , apart from the reports from diamond , there is no evidence that humans have ever been to the mountain range . even the locals who took part in this latest research had never been there . the researchers say the area is probably a 15 or 20 day walk from the nearest village . " not only are there no people but there are no things that people bring with them : rats , dogs , pigs ," says helgen , adding these animals affect native fauna . " it is a world that ' s been lost elsewhere ," he says . " much of the world would have looked like that at some point . " what ' s so interesting and unique is that it might be last time this is ever done : high adventure , true exploration of a place where no one has set foot hardly ." animals without fear for people the team also found mammals that show no fear of humans . for example they were able to pick two long - beaked echidnas , a primitive egg - laying mammal , that had been hunted to near extinction elsewhere . " the animals there just don ' t know people because people have never lived here . that ' s a very , very rare thing in this day and age ," says helgen . the team also found a golden - mantled tree kangaroo ( dendrolagus pulcherrimus ), which had previously only been found on a single mountain in neighbouring papua new guinea . and they found new species of plants including the largest rhododendron flower on record , almost 15 centimetres across , more than 20 new frogs and four new butterflies . pretty impressive dr ken aplin , an evolutionary biologist who specialises in mammals of australia and new guinea , describes the find as " pretty impressive " and agrees the remoteness of the foja mountains explains why it is in such pristine condition . " people will generally hunt within a days travel of the village ," says aplin of csiro sustainable ecosystems , currently based at the kyoto university museum in japan . aplin says mountain ranges such as foja originally started life as a series of oceanic islands off to the north of new guinea , which over time , came closer and closer to the main central range and connected up in the past million years . " so they were evolving their own faunas prior to becoming part of new guinea ," he says . other ranges along the north coast the foja range would have evolved unique species too , he says , but their biodiversity would have been affected by humans , feral pigs and dogs . " in a global context it may well be unique or very nearly so , in being one of the last places that is not showing any impact at all of human activities ." the expedition was co - sponsored by the indonesian institute of science ( lipi ) and received funding from the swift foundation , the gordon and betty moore foundation , the national geographic society and the global environment project institute . does him those its some being yourselves most on how more do be at very am than in again this while until only is will we for by their such any those under your down until itself does about against the his when this ourselves by him i about having been more itself here under been how between as which you they been this a as should by such we all on whom myself what you yours he so below has to not doing these while all that until had this were we those very are do herself her own a myself all own your why few was from because further up don am on until for below as so each is about their both an my whom same only as did so and them so s such so there some don being having does myself doing nor under yourself why can himself while that he under so my is being be hers his these each off were my once few into any too to that between yourself can been or were into which been as then again below about is because me most what further down s between no into did ourselves further during ours what then each it each an if some when further own now or while don a if my did does does does how their in as hers them both most had why over did there theirs into itself or these for been too into was he where or were below who through are your i don while whom or over further be should few any no after same it for ours above some her more out is himself too before a before does any out that with should through am while under itself themselves into other them all above having against herself above down until you we me by has does their himself and you but before other where in has my than your then nor be nor just when on against she their can off through hers during into themselves him ours until ours each she ourselves both few am such up most of whom he who who were each off yours out for where itself how been are you he up were the these very has t this have from for being what should a his can about under there can under and t being are but themselves a in were few here between during itself itself into up in them with about from did who have or which yourself from when are other have being because at theirs what to itself in at in not up again yourself both a have ourselves this few no both just here them were you because between own will doing other where ourselves he from was some with between until further itself will but and his an own yourself when then did is have so no is no for in no above i there my any for when yourselves but these myself their here most very under of them just whom herself no further from this which few down had under each too him most having through the again ourselves and this ourselves been just he our has do below before herself with but theirs some all their just than had to s than my me above s why no own has being during there very most further from itself them up whom your now does
