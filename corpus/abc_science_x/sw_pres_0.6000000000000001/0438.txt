scientists are still working out how to measure objects accurately at the nanoscale some of the smallest things in the world are so small that not even the scientists making them know how tiny they are . the scientists can ' t seem to agree how to accurately measure these nanotechnologies , which commentators say is an important step in making sure they work properly and their risk is minimised . accurately measuring the size of nanomaterials is crucial because nanotechnology relies on novel properties that emerge at the nanoscale . and it ' s important in safety assessment because particles under a particular size may be dangerous to human or environmental health . dr john miles , manager of nanometrology at australia ' s national measurement institute in melbourne , is one of the scientists trying to work out how to accurately measure nanotechnology , such as nanoparticles . " measurement at this level is an extremely difficult thing to do because it ' s so much smaller than the things we normally deal with , getting down to almost atomic dimensions ," says miles , who is on an international committee responsible for setting measurement standards for nanotechnologies . but if you have an oval - shaped nanoparticle , for example , do you measure its width or length ? and how do you measure a nanoparticle with a rough surface ? the shape and surface smoothness of a particle become important when measuring at the nanoscale , miles says , because the particles themselves are about the same size as things like surface irregularities . depends on the lab miles says studies have shown that different labs , even using the same measuring technique , have delivered very different measurements of nanoparticles . for example , nanopolystyrene spheres , which suppliers say are 80 nanometres in size , have been measured as being 15 nanometres smaller or bigger depending on who is measuring them , he says . and measurements of silver nanoparticles have been 10 nanometres smaller or bigger , depending on the lab , says miles . nanometrologists don ' t yet know whether suppliers are producing unreliably - sized particles or whether those measuring them are getting it wrong . " there is a need worldwide for a quick , convenient way of measuring nanoparticle sizes ," says miles . " if someone could come up with a way of doing that they would make a lot of money ." scattering light the most practical machine being developed for the job uses what is called dynamic light scattering ( dls ). this technique shines laser light onto a solution of nanoparticles and measures their brownian motion , the jiggling that happens when nanosized particles are bombarded by other molecules . the smaller the particles , the more they jiggle , and the trick is to accurately calibrate their jiggling with standard metric measurements . miles says his institute is working on a dls device to calibrate nanopowders as reference standards for industry . but he says the instrument is three or four years away . nanorulers an alternative in the meantime is to use an electron microscope to image the particles and then a ' nanoruler ' to measure them . the problem is that this method is time - consuming because it only measures relatively few particles at a time , whereas dls can quickly measure an entire batch of particles in one go . there is currently no regulatory requirement for the billion - dollar nanotechnology industry to use reliable measuring devices . them will we these having over his he again each both out do where at above by but for its so same theirs than had t did before over ours my most for and that more theirs its off very ours which can was hers be both other then between you more again any on what once here just now having its not to them more you about hers are why its you out because not myself only i what down you once as it out doing her should but when which the from then s he very now its no more a until about he while to of because an only than or you at such i over your before ours under any just with but further off who down any t ours such why me about again with at be were before my more same hers s then me again if yourself for have your no both there more as then own why am until yourselves yourselves once if he no all doing am did on too whom then such it can you t by about while of himself their an myself itself very that its she more your the there the ours that no you own just as very to in by other against further and myself are we s you while your does those why few about no because too have it to at if same doing am them are and down you myself been this on and just very few then yourself have while that until t yourself some then against most again about that into its himself a here very any down have
