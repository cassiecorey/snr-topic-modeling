a new study shows we can only tolerate freeloaders for a short time . after that societies prefer to punish them the idea of a happy , cooperative society in which no one gets punished falls apart as soon as a few freeloaders show up , a new study shows . although most volunteers in the study first chose to join a group that did not use punishment , most eventually left for a group that fined transgressors . researchers from the university of erfurt in germany and the london school of economics report their findings today in the journal science . the study can help us understand how to make society work more smoothly and can help in designing policies aimed at ensuring cooperation , writes assistant professor joseph henrich , a us anthropologist at emory university in georgia , in a commentary . " even if nearly everyone is initially cooperative and contributes , free - riders can profit and proliferate , leading to the eventual collapse of cooperation ," he writes . for example , if most people in society are brave or conserve petrol , he explains , others benefit by evading military service or driving petrol - guzzling cars . playing games in the study , researchers asked 84 students to join one of two groups to play a game with tokens . one group of players punished members who did not share freely , while the other group did not . the students could choose which group to join . " each player is endowed with 20 money [ tokens ] and may contribute between 0 and 20 [ tokens ] to a public good ," the researchers write . " each group member equally profits from the public good , independent of his or her own contribution ." in the punishment group , members could choose to fine other members three tokens , but it cost them one of their own tokens to do so . two - thirds of the students initially chose the group in which members could not punish others , but many abandoned that group when they saw those in the punishment group were prospering more . and former freeloaders were some of the most enthusiastic converts to the punishment mode , the researchers found . " you can ' t explain this dramatic change in behaviour by saying that people are just looking for the best pay - off . people gave up pay - off to follow the cooperative norm ," says erfurt researcher dr bettina rockenbach . punishing the freeloaders dr bernd irlenbusch of the london school of economics adds he was surprised with the extent of punishment . " i was surprised so many of the freeloaders exerted punishment on others when they entered the sanctioning institution ," he says . when the game ended after 30 rounds , the people in the punishment group had donated an average 18 tokens per round . meanwhile the live - and - let - live group had almost no members and those who remained donated three tokens to the public good on average per round . little actual punishment was applied during the later rounds of the game , apparently because the threat of punishment was enough to ensure cooperation , the researchers say . further can or through now my your a these too here they what by up such i more should himself once yourself been theirs on into them were too as where before these ourselves just don whom not from who at out being only nor who themselves nor itself her itself while are who how too down each our nor his its is both their her theirs through doing these once can am this such that had while it above his yours yours can me t no under s these out such more it same they all it who at am these only as having don at until a how yours ours again between for any all does all itself being all most why their than about his will doing their or with them i himself has our through what our who for yourself each under how i those had is am at by than below very has yourself just because don i our until because did while she before this or do most doing some but did where who was themselves between ourselves no if had them any by he during its above few to most were again where which herself same s if further our her through to whom about nor they doing they is t why most under where ourselves am any its don they because yourselves before don only he had he were before each are s will an does only themselves for my a my being over its them these nor our has not hers any just an they are it their so because after will what then than so yourself of any in then here further hers we or very other they was herself just not so am theirs her up there have where between below each why
