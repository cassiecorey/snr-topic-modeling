seabirds and migratory birds are early responders to changes in climate , according to a new report nearly three quarters of all bird species in northeast australia and more than a third in europe could become extinct unless efforts to stop global warming are stepped up , a report says . up to 72 % of bird species in northeastern australia and 38 % of bird species in europe could disappear completely if the planet ' s temperature continues to rise , according to the international environmental group wwf . " this report finds certain bird groups , such as seabirds and migratory birds , to be early , very sensitive responders to current levels of climate change ," says wwf ' s director of climate change policy hans verolme . " large - scale bird extinctions may occur sooner than we thought ," he says in bird species and climate change : the global status report , released today on the sidelines of the un climate change conference in nairobi . " if high rates of extinction are to be avoided , rapid and significant greenhouse gas emissions cuts must be made ," wwf says . rising sea levels , changes in vegetation and altered temperatures are among the effects of climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions that impact negatively on bird species worldwide , it says . in the great plains of north america , where up to 80 % of the continent ' s ducks come to breed , three quarters may face extinction because of adverse global warming - related changes to their habitat , the report says . while the effects would be most significant if the earth ' s surface temperature rises 2 & deg ; c above its pre - industrial level - it is currently 0 . 8 & deg ; c above - some birds are already feeling the heat . the penguin population of the galapagos islands has decreased by half since the early 1970s , due to starvation and an inability to reproduce resulting from the effects of the el ni & ntilde ; o climate pattern . while migratory , mountain , island , wetland , artic , antarctic and seabirds are all at high risk from climate change , other species that are able to move easily to new habitats will not be as badly effected , it says . scientists also point out that existing conservation programs do not provide sufficient protection , as bird species often shift into unprotected zones , the report says . she been he more s why why because but having there your in himself will own into all only being when this himself they too those nor that which these from has who again who their than over my who about was nor both down will both when further while theirs below under did few the what as a its such whom and his after into but to to down between so how from does between from hers here him those myself themselves does with from she why all hers so should a an do from now been yourselves itself when if your just off about these has has in him her do with other against once here very myself but that can herself those after more down just some him him yours in ours he any such just these how then all some he them being should there as and s during your did before himself own to any as few with very will that of they very then these and and was whom yours over who when each has will until it your doing has their how off on what any then if ourselves their how them we is which themselves themselves be him then the will did its when have as has if does under me him about itself any doing once she can not than between until while did who he herself themselves me don t i then will had yourselves your have through ourselves does my for same having been all by been his himself after a should too during by hers theirs my until over me more herself should themselves how before now am as so they will an now doing to not you why so its but up too i if what no how been doing few his with
