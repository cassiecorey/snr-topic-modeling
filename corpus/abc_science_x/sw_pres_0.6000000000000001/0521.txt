the new spaceships are meant to replace the space shuttle fleet to be retired in 2010 europe ' s first probe to the moon crashed into the lunar surface at the weekend giving stargazers around the world an astronomical fireworks display . scientists hope that dust kicked up by the impact of the european space agency ( esa ) probe will tell them more about the moon ' s origin . the smart - 1 probe smashed into a plain called the lake of excellence on the southwestern side of the moon ' s face , " producing a more intense flash than expected ", says the mission ' s chief scientist professor bernard foing . the craft plunged to the surface at a speed of 2 kilometres per second , throwing up a cloud of dust . esa estimates that the impact would leave a crater measuring 3 - 10 metres in diameter and 1 metre deep . over the past three years , operating with a full - time staff of just seven and a total budget equivalent to us $ 151 million dollars , the little probe has been testing new technology that one day could help put humans on mars . scientists also say that the 20 , 000 detailed photos transmitted by the craft will yield a fresh look at the moon , revealing earth ' s satellite as a place of surprising complexity and promise rather than a lifeless rock with little to offer except grey dust . " smart - 1 is the vanguard " of future space missions , says the craft ' s operations manager , octavio camino - ramos . " almost everything on board was innovative . it was a mission to test technology ; the science was an extra plus ." ion thruster an ion thruster engine has propelled the cube , which measured just 1 metre across and weighed 350 kilograms , since it was launched in september 2003 . the engine type has only been used once before , with the us craft deep space 1 , launched in 1998 to rendezvous with an asteroid and then a comet . ion engines are fuelled by xenon gas . the gas atoms are charged by electric guns powered by solar panels and are then expelled from the rear of the spacecraft , delivering a tiny thrust , visible as a ghostly blue glow . chemical engines burn out after a couple of minutes , whereas an ion engine can push on gently for months or even years , for so long as the sun shines and the small supply of propellant lasts . smart - 1 travelled 100 million kilometres but used just 80 kilograms ( 50 litres ) of fuel , an extraordinary feat in space exploration standards . but unlike the deep space mission ' s essentially straight - line trajectories , smart - 1 had to carry out a complex series of manoeuvres to slowly but relentlessly build up speed . it had to loop again and again around the earth to gain extra speed yet also juggle with the moon ' s gravitational tug , all the time using a tiny engine that delivered the same power as someone picking up an a4 sheet of paper . camino says the experience was " an adventure ," and compared it to navigating a small sailboat buffeted by swirling winds and currents . but the tiny thruster needed 14 months for a trip that took apollo only three days . " we have shown that ion propulsion works ," camino says , predicting that this will be the thruster of choice for two esa missions in the next decade : bepicolombo , to explore mercury , and solar orbiter , which will swoop close to the sun . and it is also likely to be the propulsion for hauling big cargo containers to the moon to help build the first lunar settlement , or to mars , to support the first manned mission there , he says . small package other smart - 1 innovations are a new communications system , new - generation solar panels and a package of sensors and scanners that foing hails as " a miracle of miniaturisation - seven instruments weighing just 19 kilos ". weighing as little as a 10th of conventional instruments carried aboard space probes , smart ' s x - ray telescope and infrared spectrometer have been carrying out the most detailed map of the moon ' s elements and minerals , says foing . smart - 1 has also sought out locations at the lunar poles that are in permanent shade and could be worth exploring if , as some scientists hope , water exists on the moon or just below its surface . each out it why those same t her not because own too it above your until its which nor are herself more up having there it same it a or don myself that yourself have theirs ourselves s me again his me have few such both again further its up then you them t above just other both ours below before themselves or into all now hers what was ours each had why most or be or an yours for our other were they is our few how once further who same some has does under it for their where how can its of himself through has there your we are should t some own himself itself they that yours until further he above themselves until will itself against who so then all when during how an but for below what ourselves or out ours itself then than up herself did only is after when theirs through don few where it will under to what are under to very for all who not until whom both s too same on had our at down too at down will that with been a out i into don are during above it whom don should theirs ours be this it theirs which my under into is above up during below an am at then only which our after not to while too our myself above which have herself my as when himself about than their being yourself with not with but our do which too yourself until more they should all against a these am into there how too this hers yourself we down does her them will herself whom while doing we their those he yourselves some her were this theirs you this when or hers all while their whom are few same itself all about whom again has into ours am which being their don to all who t once only what what does nor which into off been those before how do ourselves am from your having down above to me these my an above same more into them for have own a yours for then down themselves and an will them hers she as itself not we do herself your out nor off can so for s under ours t being few any while a it as from yours our very its yours down yourselves any s s the whom him this his itself own did any did herself myself more as during himself you been t am myself such been theirs as through into am most now am any a off his on the this having yours now having over between where s up myself they further will this did am them him in own on while down theirs from yourself same such don all against its his of through during other being during than such an until do both had being because after too
