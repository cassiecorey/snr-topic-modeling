differences in levels of gene expression between men and women may help to explain why they respond differently to drugs and diseases thousands of genes behave differently in the same organs of males and females , researchers report , a finding that may help explain why men and women have different responses to drugs and diseases . their study of brain , liver , fat and muscle tissue from mice show that gene expression , the level of activity of a gene , varies greatly according to sex . the same is almost certainly true of humans , the team at the university of california los angeles report . " this research holds important implications for understanding disorders such as diabetes , heart disease and obesity , and identifies targets for the development of gender - specific therapies ," says jake lusis , a professor of human genetics who worked on the study . writing in the august issue of the journal genome research , the researchers say that even in the same organ , scores of genes vary in expression levels between the sexes . the smallest differences are in brain tissue . " we saw striking and measurable differences in more than half of the genes ' expression patterns between males and females ," says dr thomas drake , a professor of pathology . " we didn ' t expect that . no one has previously demonstrated this genetic gender gap at such high levels ." xia yang , a postdoctoral fellow in cardiology who led the study , says the implications are important . " males and females share the same genetic code , but our findings imply that gender regulates how quickly the body can convert dna to proteins ," yang says . " this suggests that gender influences how disease develops ." in liver tissue , the findings imply male and female livers function the same , but at different rates . " our findings in the liver may explain why men and women respond differently to the same drug ," lusis says . " studies show that aspirin is more effective at preventing heart attack in men than women . one gender may metabolise the drug faster , leaving too little of the medication in the system to produce an effect ." yang adds : " many of the genes we identified relate to processes that influence common diseases . this is crucial , because once we understand the gender gap in these disease mechanisms , we can create new strategies for designing and testing new sex - specific drugs . doing very have been between has were against doing any why have are through do before his s during to too against each below these as to did we on ourselves do below don same what above now own themselves each same if very too just does themselves were above of we any above few is were no only will when does i ours i herself how to both when am i himself how has further both itself same so between her should you own if after been some his when not this other our their herself these a are them other they me up than when or its such themselves only i above had only after when has he be will does theirs of were just we my yourself those yours its from than himself had of some just above very how our into theirs no she its me below whom his were each but there not don before our for than will if out between your whom in hers itself yourselves down will for them t who has them through but down myself to should yourselves out should there it it not are ourselves into above were was on was at only were or myself there himself were above only when their herself have hers again about she we which it her are was t below for do down is this should into too very himself had into where where my were to into this having s below how when while themselves be be all she were myself than or them off i doing does of through himself
