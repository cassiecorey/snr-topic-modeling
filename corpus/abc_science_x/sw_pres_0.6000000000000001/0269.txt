a good budget for medical research in the short term , says one expert the australian government should have spent more of its budget surplus on building the nation ' s future r & d capacity rather than tax breaks , say commentators in the science community . the 2006 - 07 federal budget has delivered a $ 5 . 97 billion for science and innovation and $ 559 . 6 million to universities , primarily for capital developments . while the government describes the spending on science and innovation as being at record level , and points to a big boost given to medical research , many say the government ' s spending priorities are leaving australia behind in terms of future capacity . professor snow barlow of the university of melbourne says the amount spent on science and innovation may be a record in absolute terms , but as a percentage of gross national product it is decreasing . " it ' s actually lower than it ' s been in 20 years ," says barlow , who is a former member of the prime minister ' s science , engineering and innovation council . he says australia is still investing less than competitors , including china , india and oecd countries . and while he welcomes increased spending on health and aged care he says investment in that area will not spawn new industries . " i just don ' t see any investment in things that might drive the future prosperity of australia ," says barlow . he says there should have been more funding for the australian research council , especially the council ' s linkage grants , which have contributions from industry . innovative capability not addressed bradley smith , executive director of federation of australian scientific and technological societies , agrees medical research is the big winner from the budget . " the budget has quite a number of welcome one - off initiatives which support infrastructure at a handful of universities and medical research institutes ," he says . and he says there is a modest increase in research infrastructure for universities but he says there is a lack of commitment to education and skills development . " the overwhelming sense is there is still not a concerted effort by government to underpin the serious development of our innovative capability ," says smith . medical research gets ' a minus ' the budget committed an additional a $ 500 million over four years to the national health and medical research council , provided a $ 170 million for new health and medical research fellowships , a $ 22 million for stem cell research and over a $ 200 million in additional funding for medical research institutes . " it ' s a start in the right direction ," says professor kurt lambeck , the new president of the australian academy of science . " as far as the medical research part is concerned i ' d probably give it an ' a minus '," he says . " but other than medical there ' s really nothing in it that i can find ." " in particular what i find disappointing is that there is no long - term investment in people ." lambeck says the new health and medical research fellowships may help stop the brain drain at the elite level , there is still a major problem for most research scientists once they finish their phd and post - doctoral training . expenditure on infrastructure is one thing , says lambeck : " but is it going to provide the intellect to drive that infrastructure ?" he says there should have been increased funding specifically for mid - career researchers , to provide the transition from the post - doctoral fellowships to long - term commitments . short term and even medical researchers have reservations about the budget . " overall , this is a good budget for medical research in the short term ," says professor bob williamson of the university of melbourne and chair of the national committee for medicine of the australian academy of science . " the main concern that researchers will have is that , compared to canada or european countries , we still do not use much of our wealth to create a strategic infrastructure in science , technology and education ," he says . " the right allocation of resources for the long term should be a high priority not only for the present generation , but to ensure health and wealth for australia in the future ." other allocations in the budget include : & bull ; a $ 500 million to restore the health of the murray - darling basin & bull ; a $ 98 . 3 million over four years to deal with illegal foreign fishing & bull ; a $ 44 . 2 million over three years to strengthen defences against bird flu & bull ; a $ 16 million over four years to boost pest and disease preparedness & bull ; a $ 15 . 3 million over the next four years to upgrade questacon national science and technology centre & bull ; a $ 3 million to help develop a research quality framework for research funding and & bull ; a $ 1 . 5 million per year funding increase for australian scientists collaborating on research projects with china . be will at will were you you same your theirs were all only against we during not as few most hers nor again during any most this an doing but both during i it nor then is or other each by whom out who once below s other them own on yourself am s by were with do from in off in herself other at up out how these below were being that its here s herself own again he by off theirs yourselves of with they those because nor once not both has whom from she can was had this about at she him each now an itself yourselves those until after can which too further when more after whom once too only whom they who ourselves both does don those those been for theirs we have i in all are can an what of only and off of down yourselves themselves having its where we how you and each them further because over had few been ours don below is having her hers hers just before no so did me being above an themselves yours of themselves s up after where some himself can but such below has they once than into to out can who he only out yourself be any most than they be other ourselves my between was then down after by themselves if when so the am am them each did their same when how why doing into don was nor where are did than into hers are were should each above from after been t herself such once into what was after been on here now being theirs a during s them out do can by or your do i them an but few why only them is ourselves t being herself yourself did before in here any by above who had and she then theirs here both these an yourself herself against an being which any itself below should a these an other now now will between both do most she you few herself doing which whom and he under again we same them very yourself themselves about again t in only had and s her his ours in by or an under or once who herself t they over other does between it myself here my where nor same what the but against we why of they should any an as myself should am by to where and as who he such by your a themselves some it had here these on until itself each too up their doing you of most what same over did each him more here here ours most than nor over what after are the i what own down some itself only is down has me ours our each hers was few do is no other over until she whom then by through during during its does it any over ours been is so all off being there how does that nor here she themselves some through theirs just any those who no in over why he its in all him out that through all you more itself can being has at so in doing can was they until theirs not if above now how below himself its its off after than yourself do
