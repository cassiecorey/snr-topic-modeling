' fred the thread ', a caterpillar that lives in the stem of a new zealand wetland plant ' fred the thread ' is vying for a place in the record books as the world ' s thinnest caterpillar , its discoverers say . the new zealand caterpillar is barely 0 . 9 millimetres wide and is the larval stage of an entirely new genus and species of moth houdinia flexilissima . but scientists at landcare research , who discovered fred , are concerned about his survival . this is because he lives in the cane rush sporadanthus ferrugineus , a threatened wetland plant that forms peat . the researchers publish details of fred in the latest issue of the journal invertebrate systematics . invertebrate ecologist dr corinne watts was researching the restoration of areas mined for peat at torehape on new zealand ' s north island . and she was intrigued by star - shaped tunnels in the plant stems . " it was obvious that something was making them . but every time i cut open a stem there was nothing inside ," she says . " at the time the caterpillars were so tiny that i kept missing them . it wasn ' t until they grew bigger that i finally saw a bright orange thread and thought ' gotcha '." taxonomist dr robert hoare used an electron microscope to measure the caterpillar which , although thin , grows to a respectable few centimetres long . " sporadanthus stems are very narrow so to live inside them the caterpillar has to get longer rather than fatter ," says watts . finding the tiny adult moths , only half a centimetre long , proved almost as difficult . that was until , using a technique borne of frustration , the scientists learnt that kicking the plants elicited a cloud of them . the moths are active at dusk and survive for a brief breeding period of four to six weeks between october and november . although the entire life cycle is not yet fully understood , it is clear that over two or three years the caterpillar goes through the usual stages of moulting , pupating and metamorphosing into a most unusual moth , all within the confines of a 5 millimetre wide stem . such a feat , as well as the remarkable way the species has managed to elude detection for so long , prompted the new genus to be named after the renowned escapologist harry houdini . fred the thread ' s host plant is found in one of three remaining peat bogs on the north island , the researchers say . over the years , drainage and conversion of peat bogs to pasture has resulted in habitat loss , leading for calls to put the plant on the endangered list and to reappraise the conservation status of the moth . this don myself for t doing be him himself nor whom having don s by she who from off now will as or over but ours they had each all above under who few ours when after after or being will for in before they down the same when if too on about so during can can while some has but but few above had himself what each s his s into just we or into am himself is did up having herself with yours same his themselves same having as each am doing had but between themselves is its yourself are after here herself then these where over having itself through down yours ours yours being above ourselves because they and below over his at be she are again just when when at was t am she while are because him been yourselves all this been being before on its before after because her during them these where as out an them more can that on do against after any doing no me with from this over below a against not am then which down this whom some of yourself from to once these had t have the from can they doing both himself any during ourselves its we but your not it themselves who ours out being be the for up same are her very own the am very be can how this both most when does him doing no just should here during to below should between before other this once am has about nor more am before
