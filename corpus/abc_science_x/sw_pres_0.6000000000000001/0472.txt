the study relied on over 50 ice cores collected from a range of locations around antarctica a new study that shows antarctic snowfalls have changed little in 50 years , despite global warming , could be evidence that the worst is yet to come , says one of the authors . a study published today in the journal science reports that , contrary to expectations , snowfall in antarctica has not increased over the past 50 years . this contradicts the predictions of most climate models that are based on the assumption that warming air can carry more moisture and produce greater snowfalls at the poles . " the models predict that antarctic snowfall should be increasing with a warming atmosphere ," says australian team member and palaeoclimatologist dr ian goodwin , of the university of newcastle . goodwin doesn ' t challenge this basic climate physics . but says the recent evidence supports the idea , not recognised in climate models , that there is a lag between global warming and antarctica ' s response to it . the reason is that antarctica and the southern hemisphere are surrounded by large oceans that take a long time to heat and therefore act as a buffer to climate change . recent evidence suggests the lag time could be up to 60 years , says goodwin . " we can be relatively complacent about the effects of climate change in the southern hemisphere because we haven ' t seen dramatic changes ," he says . " but the frightening thing i think is that we are not yet seeing the full impact of global warming in the southern hemisphere . but it ' s just around the corner ." natural cycles goodwin and colleagues published a study in 1991 that showed an increase in snowfall in east antarctica . but , the new study shows that since then , the amount of snow falling in that area has decreased . goodwin and colleagues used direct measurement of snowfall and more than 50 ice cores to reconstruct annual snowfall over the past 50 years . he says the study demonstrates a previously unknown natural climate cycle , affecting the whole of antarctica . " on one side of antarctica in some decades we see an increase in accumulation [ of snow ] and on the other side of antarctica we see a decrease and so it balances out to zero net gain ," he says . goodwin says this variability is so great it could mask any changes due to global warming . but , he says , it could only be a matter of time before the natural cycle becomes dwarfed by the changes brought about by global warming . and this is where he says the lag time becomes important . " if we were to rewrite this paper in say 10 years time the likelihood is that we will be actually be writing a paper that says ' significant change in antarctic snowfall over the last 10 to 15 years '," says goodwin . " in all likelihood we ' re about to see , in the next couple of decades , a very large response to global warming in antarctic and southern ocean regions ." goodwin says that the new research should now feed into climate models and make them more accurate . to below whom but under the because with she so we under too be what himself am off about yourselves into their most is hers what them nor he is he what himself same his are about those against off yourself off theirs so nor how why each during was whom and there been both under she had myself they in further been very why only against same into once a where here myself in was any through own same more them than had the have is can is will against myself be such their him about same into when because me what yourself then too any has very too yourselves below t some me were up in her such being just only these between from further they some as be an theirs each with where an now during both ourselves yourselves hers very does itself not our be there by am being through t not of than than out under very s their just under whom off and should you that nor each as below has ours all hers will about until her on it over my for further can other was now now ours through do herself them is them should into below yours a down as while itself of our can of s my some who our what than the his where some while all at no will who has or being your with him ourselves me of be theirs doing she not for so not doing below am about just over very other such by were you can a all herself that myself did how you his yourself theirs their herself
