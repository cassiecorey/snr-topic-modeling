a seed bank , to be built in the artic , will be essential to protect future agriculture , its proponents say a frozen noah ' s ark to safeguard the world ' s crop seeds from disasters will be built on a remote arctic island off norway , the norwegian government says . construction of the global seed vault , in a mountainside on the island of svalbard 1000 kilometres from the north pole , would start in june with completion due in september 2007 . " norway will by this contribute to the global system for ensuring the diversity of food plants . a noah ' s ark on svalbard if you will ," says norwegian agriculture and food minister terje riis - johansen . the doomsday vault would be built near longyaerbyen , svalbard ' s main village , with space for three million seed varieties . it would store seeds including rice , wheat , and barley as well as fruits and vegetables . it would be a remote arctic back - up for scores of other seed banks around the world , which may be more vulnerable to risks ranging from nuclear war to mundane power failures . " gene banks can be affected by shutdowns , natural disasters , wars or simply a lack of money ," riis - johansen says . loss of genetic diversity would mean losing a part of cultural heritage . " we also reduce the ability of agriculture to meet new challenges relating to climate change , population increase , and so on ," he says . the seeds would be stored at - 18 & deg ; c . if the power fails , the seeds will probably stay frozen . " the temperature there is around - 3 & deg ; c , - 4 & deg ; c in the summer but we believe that even if the freezers broke down a suitable temperature would last for months ," says grethe helene evjen , a senior adviser at the agriculture ministry . " this will be primarily a duplicate storage for plant seeds already stored elsewhere ," she says . seeds would remain the property of nations making deposits . norway would provide 30 million norwegian crowns ( u $ 4 . 94 million ) to build the vault . norway has long talked of building the arctic seed vault without previously taking action . for about 15 years some varieties of seed have been stored in a disused svalbard mine under a plan to see if they can germinate after 100 years . norway has worked with the un food and agriculture organization on the plans . it would also get financial support from the global crop diversity trust to help poor countries use the storage . no did they what no between have had but s she some nor is just just you through her an will each himself each were against be which because be same is its at when some yours while s its than themselves up should not an than being does if few did him before most were because it some have yours my because i here because of she when with itself ours above do if is before himself where of me had above where my during all myself of whom our the we are have into some on i had them of again other have which with both most into how me her such which before be by do any did did his again i now such me in hers or some now some each just both them on when during should most were it they from for those now for too then again through too were where ours where some yourselves herself no there whom have to ourselves as for which itself yours does her until me more so that are than those be because own be once than herself his other while very nor with me not will very do where was then been ourselves can of a doing just here been herself should my all does should their t they below theirs most all whom after each yourselves we did but any them is there being about theirs yours of did when than just until most own between or them then my after t if other am no before further him the theirs up until then such into by other if a where my up off him off if that than those other by it and doing them you during whom this where each she which this myself at very themselves yourselves own again theirs below own after did both him under further who should of on during off been that both will was no
