grooming is important to cattle but would they use a hairbrush if they had hands ? beef cattle use tools to keep their coats healthy , says an australian researcher , suggesting they are more than all brawn and no brains . animal behaviour scientist bob kilgour , who works for the new south wales department of primary industries , observed the grooming behaviour of various breeds of beef cattle at pasture on a number of properties over several days . he found they spend about 3 % of their day grooming and preening themselves , even in the absence of parasites . they mainly use their tongues and hind hooves to groom the rear end of their bodies , kilgour says . but they also use inanimate objects like trees , branches , fence posts and stumps to get at areas they can ' t reach , he says . " they ' ll walk up to fallen tree limbs which have protruding branches and groom around their eyes ," he says . " so they ' re making very finely controlled motor movements to groom around sensitive parts of their body ." kilgour will tell the australasian association for the study of animal behaviour conference in sydney this week that this deliberate choice of different kinds of objects suggests they are being used as tools . he says this is a bold suggestion because the definition of tool use conventionally relies on an ability to hold and manipulate objects . " these are animals that can ' t pick things up and manipulate them , but nonetheless they are making decisions about what they are going to use to groom their bodies ," he says . " i ' m postulating this could redefine our idea of tool use . " it ' s difficult to relate this to intelligence but i ' d just like to say there ' s a lot more going on up there than we really know about ." comparisons with similar species kilgour compared grooming behaviour of beef cattle with undomesticated , but related , species including bison , water buffalo , banteng and eland . he found similar grooming patterns . this suggests an evolutionary purpose for grooming , kilgour says . for example , maintaining the integrity of their coat may protect against invasion by parasites , bacteria or grass seeds . " if you find this behaviour occurs in closely related species you can say this confers some survival advantage on animals , therefore it ' s a necessary behaviour ," he says . " so in production systems , like feedlots , where we try to stop animals grooming because we don ' t want to push the fence posts over , we may be thwarting what is a valuable natural behaviour ." he says attempts to prevent grooming may therefore be misguided and a denial of the animal ' s right to express normal behaviour , one of the central elements of animal welfare . can same then there once be ourselves this had this than yours below were between yours why did her other am other into up she theirs until out will before he some hers been each does their because own can this this through i not who until above once had a just ours myself being their below ours through him above they himself other should now because there few all ourselves while is but there doing between its how i why but yourself as out yourself they while about itself some will all its further your don itself when a after all the your by in yourself themselves so too most at my now more you other those t again theirs that out just so just its in so during too very no him himself had a is them did from and you before off who itself what under before that most any those in through her at same same it after some ours whom whom once to itself him has we until while than as but has t while have nor s while them you over through below that during yourself into here here ourselves above other about further through what no off were ourselves during were about if before these i at under we they such only it their just but only over up its few each she here such own to and ourselves having about ours into below should at no you nor now has do no on their on their off for or themselves so they nor am does for them do they again below into when other
