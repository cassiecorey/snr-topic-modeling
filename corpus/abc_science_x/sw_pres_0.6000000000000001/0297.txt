before the big bang could have been a previous universe a lot like our own , that first collapsed and then inflated into the universe we have today the big bang may have been a big bounce , say theorists searching for what preceded the birth of our own universe . if their new mathematical simulations are correct , what came before the big bang was a previous universe a lot like our own . it collapsed on itself , then some weird physics caused it to inflate into the universe we have today . physicist dr abhay ashtekar of pennsylvania state university and team publish their results in a recent issue of physical review letters . what has blocked the pre - big bang view from theoreticians was the mathematical expression of what was happening - based on certain assumptions about space - time . the problem was the calculations kept ramming up against infinity . when that happens , equations fail . " it ' s like having an impenetrable wall ," says ashtekar . " when it comes to infinity we cannot , in physics , go beyond it ." space - time is a model that combines three - dimensional space and one - dimensional time into a single unit called the space - time continuum . in this continuum , time is considered the fourth dimension . what was becoming infinite in scientists ' calculations was the curvature of the space - time continuum as you near the time when everything in the universe and all the gravity was concentrated into a single point . gravity shreds fabric of space - time the pre - big bang gravity basically shredded the space - time fabric and left only the physics of atoms - quantum physics - to work with . to peer into that unimaginable crush , ashtekar and colleagues started gain without assuming that the " fabric " of space - time continuum existed in the earliest moments of the universe . " the general belief is that the continuum may be just an approximation ," says ashtekar . " this is something even einstein said ." instead , the team applied what ' s called loop quantum gravity , a strategy that has been developed to join quantum physics with einstein ' s general relativity . quantum theory suggests big crunch according to loop quantum gravity , the fabric of space is made of discrete and identical one - dimensional quantum threads . at the big bang , the fabric is a shredded mess and only these threads can be followed further back . using this concept , the researchers concluded that a previous universe collapsed in on itself in a gigantic gravitational big crunch . then , when the density of that crunch reached super astronomical values , gravity flipped into a repulsive force - another weird outcome of this physics - and inflated the new universe in which we live . " it ' s long been speculated that as you get to the big bang , quantum theory was going to be important ," says physicist dr jorge pullin of louisiana state university . it ' s also been speculated that if you could work out the equations , you ' d probably see that the big bang was a big bounce , he says . but this is the first time that anyone has actually done a thorough job working through the physics back through the big bang , he says . previous universe elusive as for what it tells us about the previous universe , it ' s not much , says pullin . " the only thing you can conclude is that the bounce occurs ," he says . that ' s not to say we will never learn more about the earlier universe . astronomers are discovering patterns in the cosmic background radiation that appear to be the inflated remnants of electron - sized irregularities in the first instant of the big bang . could those irregularities , combined with loop quantum gravity , reveal patterns inherited from the earlier universe ? " there may be certain hints left behind ," says pullin . any the such or no these how just about who their them was before the its between into hers off at our she through will this having just their off because and me has from what nor itself into themselves whom then as those yours its over than himself her s as more what into itself both the why can she here on each these than into was been over what very up above all so any each hers down your an as doing don and again then just as while here out any don do be any before it of an doing should for while into whom we at only my his themselves been only a have how who he some a again can over their no who was on each s those out this to too does and it off here be was very ours your at am doing yourself or me from a me a such against now what she by over that are before in by her be those themselves of am herself does in the all herself now there which at very under did or their too in once for above an under me you while between himself its being again then while where into for then a some other some she same until was up she had before theirs don under me this and himself then there are not a only now it by no with can of whom does i will our been ours very against here where above at do through once why does now not this whom be until few most we between them we his on yourselves me just off are she its does she just how on through than down was do only me so then from until on from my then again not with me same yourselves few there an yourselves own to have did him from at been it most you am only were by this further ourselves while ours did while are s and what yourself after it himself myself herself other here itself out here the do doing is does with than it once just have herself don down or just at into some theirs her were other a same which yourselves itself an the all am
