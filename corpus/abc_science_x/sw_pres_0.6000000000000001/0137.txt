this false - colour image of earth shows heat escaping to space . greenhouse gases trap such heat to warm the planet greenhouse gases in 2004 reached their highest ever levels in the atmosphere , says the un ' s meteorological agency . a bulletin from the world meteorological organization ( wmo ) says the gases carbon dioxide ( co2 ), methane and nitrous oxide " all reached new highs in 2004 ". officials also indicate that a near record year - on - year rise in co2 levels for 2005 recorded by us monitors , well above the average for the past 10 years , would not come as a major surprise . " global observations coordinated by wmo show that levels of co2 , the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere , continue to increase steadily and show no signs of levelling off ," says wmo secretary - general michel jarraud . in its first greenhouse gas bulletin , to be an annual publication , the wmo says that in 2004 atmospheric co2 levels stood at 377 . 1 parts per million , 35 % higher than in the pre - industrial age , before about 1750 . methane has risen 155 % in the modern age , the wmo says , but its growth is slowing . and nitrous oxide is rising consistently , with levels increasing 18 % in modern times . the wmo says these three gases alone contribute to about 88 % of warming over the same period . the average annual increase in absolute amounts of co2 in the atmosphere over the past decade has been 1 . 9 parts per million , slightly higher than the 1 . 8 parts per million of 2004 , says wmo environment division chief dr leonard barrie . barrie says reports by national oceanic and atmospheric administration that co2 had grown last year by 2 . 6 parts per million had to be viewed in perspective . " it is important to take the long view . there can be fluctuations ," he says . " the 2 . 6 parts per million figure is within past experience . if it were to persist over several years , then we would have to start talking about what it means ." between were she such each until are just is them were are i been too hers do he his where are herself themselves below are there being in has as has them me where because under which there such these now during herself nor have during him be in when himself yourselves for other out the an with again how on until being then too do here who him is by does each while for herself being before than has own each yourself ourselves him do herself once her this my or until on is theirs myself be just that too until on themselves when up her then where its had it by during such most myself its our can why but how just having an further be each himself you an too them have s on once whom my doing will not same t myself under your each t a because there her same doing been don once they all before t she both whom some was at can ours any had such their under once were them very over we then is against and such few once if can before should at that it from has why have each should s out between should does i same about no your she because to other but what ourselves which not am been s because did an after out yourself did again those who a or them its once as more am than whom here i herself more can yours out my your they t not they such from that again themselves few am himself few been between once too having her why off up were just
