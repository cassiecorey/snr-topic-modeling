pericles probably died of typhoid fever , as did as many as one - third of his fellow athenians modern dna analysis of ancient dental pulp suggests that typhoid fever caused the plague that helped to end the golden age in athens , scientists say . the dna collected from teeth from an ancient greek burial site is similar to a modern organism that causes typhoid fever , an infection spread by contaminated food or water . " studying the historical aspects of infectious disease can be a powerful tool for several disciplines to learn from ," says dr manolis papagrigorakis of university of athens , a co - author of the study published in the international journal of infectious diseases . " we believe this report to be of outstanding importance for many scientific fields , since it sheds light on one of the most debated enigmas in medical history ." up to one - third of athenians are thought to have died from the plague that spread to greece from ethiopia , egypt and libya in 430 - 426 bc . several diseases including smallpox , bubonic plague , anthrax and measles have been suggested as the cause of the plague , one of whose most prominent victims was the athenian golden age leader pericles . the plague is thought to have changed the balance of power between athens and sparta , ending athenian dominance . the scientists describe how they extracted dna from a mass burial pit in a cemetery dating back to the time the plague struck greece . papagrigorakis and his team say the dna sequences resembled salmonella enterica serovar typhi , the organism that causes typhoid fever . a is was off can an they other yourselves all its same once over her having not by these they him each your no doing themselves themselves s all his himself have were so once doing from a he been out me too from being it yourself very with while once ours other me to very and him my for more this our those herself under him no having further doing with its yours above few your themselves and she each our been its only there she a do what very him what nor into any am having herself few with my her over by most am how he does that don have myself such itself its those them this few each what same very an having when only their now or if just i down has he myself up very t on over on below only between am yourselves again some once some any herself very she our herself to been have when than most my them does am other me were just the we
