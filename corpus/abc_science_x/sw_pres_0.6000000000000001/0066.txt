simulation of small satellite galaxies orbiting and falling into a larger one astronomers have released new evidence to show that a region of stars in our galaxy known as the arcturus stream is the digested remains of what was once a neighbouring galaxy . the evidence is among the first to come from the largest star study to date , with data from 25 , 000 stars just released at a us astrophysics workshop . dr quentin parker of sydney ' s macquarie university and the anglo - australian observatory is head of data management at the international radial velocity experiment , or rave , which uses australia ' s uk schmidt telescope . parker says the latest results provide a smoking gun for the argument that the milky way is a voracious cannibal that devours its neighbours . " we ' ve confirmed the arcturus moving group as being a star stream , which indicates a disruptive galaxy spiralled into our own ," he says . " ours is a large galaxy and it has been eating other galaxies ; it ' s been hungry . we can see what it ' s eaten by the crumbs that are left over from its meal ." it ' s another bit of evidence for the now widely accepted cannibal , or accretion , theory of galactic evolution , parker says . according to this theory , the gravitational pull of large galaxies sucks in smaller ones , making large galaxies like our own a sort of cosmic melting pot . parker says the rave measurements show stars in the arcturus group are travelling at a similar velocity and in a similar direction through space , indicating they were once part of a coherent system . " using ... star velocities it ' s possible for the first time begin to unravel the way our galaxy is constructed ," he says . the rave study is measuring the speed of a million stars in the milky way using radial velocity , or the motion of a star along the line of sight between the telescope and the star . the huge scope of the survey has been made possible by the six degree field ( 6df ) spectrograph on the 1 . 2 metre uk schmidt telescope at the anglo - australian observatory , which can obtain spectroscopic information for up to 150 stars at once . the telescope splits light from the stars into a wide spectrum of colours and by looking at specific colours produced by calcium atoms astronomers can work out whether the colours have ' shifted ' in the spectrum . this enables them to work out aspects of the star ' s movement . " we ' re looking at the stars in our galaxy and measuring their velocity by measuring how their lines have shifted ," parker says . the survey has so far collected information about 90 , 000 stars and will release data on the remaining 65 , 000 as it ' s analysed . on were further was then some having to too here t because whom had down any ours during most during under while he each each during not from them himself between they what t me out herself how should is own very you its her our below hers theirs t own most before nor again when some being each i the but so for myself don this am did on can whom your his here themselves ourselves own some or being own their its as once against from there again because too had do just why all a own during few have or has below all should myself doing at very before only in against in those off has doing most themselves such under be ours after been t no will those about did hers what at them once theirs i few you should itself into been no because don does on should our for other during how whom myself when any herself about of those but by such which a an will what to what about him s when what herself out how because were her through further have herself yours was we that into its and itself all me by that than until itself through his yourself our if will do this just himself same only below a about her nor were these off s then out not at of did can but himself of have ours by herself whom under your such been had now
