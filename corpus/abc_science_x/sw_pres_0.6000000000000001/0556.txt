australian diggers in the trenches of gallipoli in 1915 australia is to be part of a major three - nation archaeological survey of the gallipoli battlefield , researchers say . associate professor chris mackie from the university of melbourne says the survey will combine conventional mapping with electromagnetic surveying to produce the most comprehensive historical and archaeological study ever conducted there . " most of the attention in the post - war period has been on the cemeteries ," he says about studies of turkey ' s gallipoli peninsula . " one of the things we ' ll be spending a great deal of time on is the mapping of the trenches to see how they cohere with surviving maps of the trenches and exploring what lies beneath ." mackie says there ' s a " distinct possibility " that a wealth of material dating back to the days of antiquity lies buried beneath the battlefield , perhaps the most historically significant military site in australia ' s history . " records from sappers dating back to 1915 mention ancient pots , ancient remains and so forth , so there could be material there ," he says . " because we ' ll be using electromagnetics you ' re coming up with all sorts of possibilities , everything from material left behind in the battle itself to much older stuff ." the survey , which will be conducted by researchers from australia , new zealand and turkey , will also aim to identify any significant trenches , command posts , outposts and key battle areas , says a spokesperson for the federal department of veterans ' affairs . " basically [ we hope to produce ] a catalogue of the ones we know of and also see if there ' s any ones we weren ' t aware of ," the spokesperson says . "[ the researchers ] hope to get together a comprehensive record of sites , gauge their condition and also recommend any ways that we can possibly protect them and enhance them ." will the site be dug up ? mackie says because of the historical and cultural sensitivity of the site " there ' s no intention to embark on any excavation ". the veterans ' affairs spokesperson says : " it ' s going to be fairly comprehensive archaeological historical research ." mackie says many people are unaware of the historical importance of the region , which includes the nearby site of the ancient battle of troy . the project was scheduled to have started earlier this year but has been delayed by diplomatic and heritage considerations , the veterans ' affairs spokesperson says . remains of diggers found in belgium confirmation of the gallipoli survey comes as the federal government announces that the remains of what are believed to be five australian world war i soldiers have been found on the western front in belgium during excavations for a gas line at frenzenbergstraat in zonnebeke . the discovery has been reported to the commonwealth war graves commission and the office of australian war graves is awaiting a full report , says veterans ' affairs minister bruce billson . he says the government will attempt to identify the remains once a report is at hand . where yourselves them our do during did nor he itself is what and himself a then are when just until each i it very by yourself will hers if her whom if yourself or itself about with once only same if now during further do itself him up your be was am yourselves was how through our be i myself when she all has by have don out be by just nor themselves while off had at do there is or such this be where both when nor yourself he before been down now me in between have what of or too when i will we herself than once our now he out for we me this this him he down can under theirs will are once did until myself yours their have some i with is same we up before just or why nor nor further until about t too when him been above our not were own being up few his our at am between such do such in such same these will yours which had myself until what few has on what our by don the against am out we having into then was above theirs about were we no off by him but has to against a has s myself which than when from above before up am those me no our off we were during being when under was to again yourself be your above nor just further s having don during ours other yourselves because how nor here that into same now to up below but theirs and are yourself each has for between not again my do his each they not too
