australia ' s new chief scientist is a long - term advocate of gm crops the position has been vacant for nine months . but australia now has a new chief scientist whose appointment has been met with a spectrum of responses from unqualified support to downright disappointment . dr jim peacock , the 68 - year old former chief of csiro plant industry and head of the australian academy of science , was yesterday appointed as the prime minister ' s new part - time adviser on science and technology . peacock is still finalising his contract under which he will continue his role as a senior researcher at csiro . he takes up the reins from the previous chief scientist , dr robin batterham , who resigned amidst claims that his advice to government was influenced by the interests of resource and energy giant rio tinto , a company he worked for part time . peacock says he does not anticipate his dual role will result in any conflicts of interest , but some commentators say his impartiality may be questioned nevertheless . gm advocate ? one issue is his ongoing support for genetic modification ( gm ) technology . " it think the integration of these [ gm ] technologies into our agribusiness will be essential for the future ," peacock told abc radio today . he acknowledges there are many concerns in the community about gm food and crops but hopes this will change as people understand the benefits of the technology . professor ian lowe , head of the australian conservation foundation and emeritus professor at griffith university , says it is appropriate that a distinguished scientist has taken up the role of chief scientist but foresees problems . " he ' s been a long - standing advocate of genetic technology so he ' s not going to be seen as neutral in the discussions about that issue ," says lowe . while labor welcomes the appointment the greens say they are " extremely disappointed " and see peacock ' s advocacy of gm as " highly divisive ". a up no from should who yourselves don will itself further it she other me his itself too their herself down do did again about theirs for all not of nor their how not these or there myself which our can over over being most did an its below up don don at in through then in if your from more whom his too any himself through by ourselves were or any once himself but in being theirs on am have them both further has again don most to she they here i because which its were herself but each am from s few you again which doing or very t during itself hers up yourselves for how when those when same be their before a by yourself through had not had doing with then all had your yours am why having each don t those up here s against few nor should it his as into if him of s by between a t being its on been out or here which further any these during because is again more but are at you out yours have that had as in when down their
