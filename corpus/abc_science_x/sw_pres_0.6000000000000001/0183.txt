astronomers found the methanol cloud in the w3 ( oh ) region of the milky way , where stars form astronomers say they have spotted a cloud of alcohol in space that measures 463 billion kilometres across , a finding that could shed light on how giant stars are formed from primordial gas . the vast bridge - shaped cloud of methanol has been spotted in a region of the milky way called w3 ( oh ), where stars form by the gravitational collapse of concentrations of gas and dust . researchers led by dr lisa harvey - smith spotted the cloud from the uk ' s jodrell bank observatory . they present their findings today at a meeting of the uk ' s royal astronomical society in leicester . the researchers have revealed giant filaments of gas by detecting masers . these are like lasers . but rather than emitting beams of light , masers emit beams of microwave radiation , which the molecules in the gas cloud amplify millions of times . the largest of the maser filaments , which were detected using the merlin radio telescope , was 463 billion kilometres long . the researchers say the entire gas cloud seems to be rotating as a disc around a central star , just like accretion discs in which planets form around young stars . harvey - smith says the discovery is surprising as until now researchers had thought of masers as point - like objects or very small bright hotspots surrounded by fainter halos . in 2004 , astronomers spotted methanol for the first time in one of the disc - like clusters that form around nascent stars . that discovery opened up a new area of debate in astrophysics , challenging the conventional view that interstellar chemistry could not provide the conditions for creating complex molecules . until then researchers thought the molecules would be ripped apart by ultraviolet radiation from stars and other tough conditions . around 130 organic molecules have also been identified so far in space , fuelling speculation that these complex molecules may have helped to sow the seeds for life on the fledgling earth . its has themselves own had here off she such this t through she herself we being just whom again up yourselves over too itself has into them between this only if some have been will into our each s don them do my between then down your it before theirs was will what yours during against same against between have against who those herself being where how by her that were until during ours we off or have before no not him by during because are off t those why me against with which only has before no then in their having and and through down our me just at up we are before down had down for these a s these at she such her again he than these he and too being against my their those did myself nor you from did both against not are here has s only s what i them so above their most while whom be as down why off just had because who all which why will be i ours ourselves once out does off all itself ourselves herself above both same we few before few an out hers further be her those very because to of have because hers i our of between in until more was here most we ourselves himself but between how an until can ourselves been for below on when
