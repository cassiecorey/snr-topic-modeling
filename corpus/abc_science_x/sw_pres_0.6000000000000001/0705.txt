a fraction of the amber collected so far from the beaches of northern australia huge chunks of amber containing the remnants of ancient rainforests have been found along beaches in far north queensland , the first amber fossils to be found in australia . the amber pieces , some as big as a football , contain flies , beetles , spiders , flowers , fungi , moss , fern spores and pollen as well as bubbles of gas and water from the time , the researchers say . the fossils are at least 4 million years old , they say , possibly much older . fisherman dale wicks and partner beth norris discovered the amber while taking evening walks along the beach on the cape york peninsula , says university of new south wales palaeontologist henk godthelp . " it turns out that it was the very first discovery of true amber in australia ," says godthelp , who was invited to analyse the fossils and reported the find at the riversleigh society meeting in sydney this week . while amber - like substances such as copal and coal resin are found in australia , no - one had found true amber , he says . godthelp , who studies the evolution of rainforests , says the fossilised resin is most likely from kauri pine , which grows in rainforests . he says amber is very good at preserving living creatures trapped inside it because it stops the air from getting to them and also contains chemicals that act as preservatives . anything trapped inside it , he says , will give a unique picture of ancient rainforests . this includes insects , which come from the rainforest canopy , and bubbles of water or gas , which he says could provide clues about past climates . nearly one in five of the amber pieces found contain fossils or bubbles of water or gas , says godthelp . " by world standards , that ' s remarkably high ." how old ? godthelp says he doesn ' t know how old the amber is yet but it would be at least 4 million years old , possibly much older . " we think it ' s probably tertiary ," he says . very his into while both until same under itself through them your herself don most a above yourselves over if until don up all why at s once of too our having of through too most theirs herself what more below again no or when only will i because down then those between are yourself how all and him i herself yourself hers no she after having be you t against than up by while while than which it off that not through her both as its what because so them him it their there but will as other with over to had do itself s in it and him not be my our as when where the then are should do between here own too now just to whom further what such she herself am so are they our with yours theirs while until itself them being you down her no an her you are own up nor their himself through most to these she am such by s up own then my how before or at to a during herself we his other into from only where any into again what will and during than have between him that only my when about but no those while yourselves you while hers other an from below off after again have over your we her from s not will ours which ourselves too does about because yourselves am where in ours other all am here while up in
