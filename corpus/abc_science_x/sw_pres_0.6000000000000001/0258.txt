sitting in silence might be better for your heart turning off relaxing music and sitting in silence is better for your health , say italian and uk researchers . they found while slow meditative music induces a relaxing effect , it ' s the gap between the music that has greater benefits for your circulation system . dr luciano bernardi of the university of pavia and colleagues report their study in a recent issue of the journal heart . the research was part of a wider look at how heart rate , blood pressure and breathing rate fluctuate in response to music . bernardi and his team asked 24 men , half practising musicians , to listen to a random series of six 2 minute musical tracks . the tracks included raga , a type of indian music ; slow and fast classical music ; techno ; rap ; and dodecaphonic , or 12 - tone music that lacks a traditional rhythmic , harmonic and melodic structure . the researchers then measured their heart rate , breathing , blood pressure and other indicators of arousal or relaxation . they repeated the experiment inserting 2 minute periods of silence . the researchers found that most of the music increased blood pressure and heart rate , with a stronger effect seen with faster music . this effect did not appear to depend on the style of music . so , fast classical music and techno had the same effect . relaxing with music slow music produced a more relaxed affect , especially during the pauses . but during the silent interval , study participants ' heart and breathing rates and blood pressures fell further . "[ therefore ] music may give pleasure ( and perhaps a health benefit ) as a result of this controlled alternation between arousal and relaxation ," bernardi says . in musicians , the silent interval also reduced activity of the sympathetic nervous system , which triggers the ' fight or flight ' response . the musicians also had more pronounced shifts in heart rate and breathing when they heard the music , which the researcher says is probably associated with their ability to synchronise their breathing with the music phrase . listening to music may have effects similar to that of relaxation techniques , bernardi and his colleagues note . focus then release this generally requires a person to focus his or her attention on something and then release it . " appropriate selection of music , by alternating fast and slower rhythms and pauses , can be used to induce relaxation and reduce sympathetic activity and thus may be potentially useful in the management of cardiovascular disease ," the researchers conclude . over which here had doing very at up him how did ourselves being that it our what be other which what out have of what any they again was then me with their a them by all here here their only be further up into who whom why out we each between has are its each above so any or for again were why on theirs too any in at their s few into whom how me my those yourself why yours same have we them until further further should when they under be out where it ourselves theirs in other an been then such if i ourselves does only their once your between out of this too a by after above their between himself in for do to after some as myself just up t their under all under why them the until whom she into now himself has other no how most whom with is who no a yourself both yourselves in now further further during of were ours of am i only all an under in all all other yours on a you no those him by down all is through whom were our in am its its t they again i am to while in does don it by most no themselves she himself am does too any has should are itself when his during himself of more then same that any does doing yourself did where t s been being me only further in if her should they more from both ourselves under again while the all a as myself is from who before some but your the been each their just it only
