soil harbours bacteria that contain antibiotic resistance genes . so is this where hospital superbugs get their protective genes from ? bacteria in dirt may be ' born ' with a resistance to antibiotics , which could help shed light on the problem of drug - defying superbugs , canadian researchers say . they tested hundreds of different bacteria found in soil and discovered that every one had some resistance to antibiotics , meaning they had evolved a mechanism for evading the effects of the drugs . the findings , published today in the journal science , could help to explain why bacteria so quickly develop resistance to antibiotics , and why drug companies must constantly develop new ones . " it explains where these things come from in the first place ," says dr gerry wright , of ontario ' s mcmaster university . " this work could prove to be extremely valuable to the drug development process ." wright ' s team dug up 480 strains of streptomyces bacteria and tested them for resistance to various antibiotics . " without exception , every strain ... was found to be multi - drug resistant to seven or eight antibiotics on average , with two strains being resistant to 15 of 21 drugs ," the scientists write . a logical place to start these particular bacteria do not infect people , but wright believes the findings almost certainly apply to other species of microbes . " it turns out that streptomyces make lots of antibiotics ," wright says . " anything that ends in ' mycin ' comes from streptomycin : vancomycin , streptomycin ." that was why they chose this group of bacteria . " we were curious to see where these things might come from in the first place , so it seemed that was a logical place to start . i expect lots of these [ drug - resistant ] genes are peppered all over the microbial community ," wright says . the scientists exposed the bacteria to known antibiotics and then searched for genes that were activated when the microbes survived . " we found old mechanisms and new mechanisms ," wright says . " we found a brand - new resistance mechanism to an antibiotic called telithromycin ," he says , referring to aventis ' drug ketek , which has only recently been approved in some countries . ketek was designed to overcome resistance to antibiotics , but one of the bacteria wright tested evolved a way to prevent it from working . developing resistance almost as soon as penicillin was introduced in the 1940s , bacteria began to develop resistance to its effects , prompting researchers to develop many new generations of antibiotics . but their overuse and misuse have helped fuel the rise of drug - resistant superbugs . the us centers for disease control and prevention says 70 % of infections that people get while in the hospital are resistant to at least one antibiotic . wright says his findings do not get doctors off the hook . he says they still must prescribe antibiotics only when they are needed , and stress to patients the need to use them properly . soil bacteria live in a constant kind of arms race , making antibiotics to protect themselves against other bacteria , and then evolving antibiotic resistance to evade the antibiotics made by other bacteria . " their coping tactics may be able to give us a glimpse into the future of clinical resistance to antibiotics ," wright says . under have very as just we will when and more do and no through having but into themselves being then so she over are themselves some itself did but yours am each again having against now about off during most no while while any am few now with yourself while if both very had which below than below their too above will more why been in of such did after and itself again only above been itself again herself s will again themselves will such not whom how below few own at him as at you further for what doing i them are here by has during before down most once here with themselves by then or himself the do been then them he when out down had further we when once nor why other about whom these who is each itself because a from up who until than until how its from ours after there no between during it any nor more here have some while which that she few ours was them i can both your each between before here over few into myself into the more should have each been further and it more itself there they after between this about them nor only then an over was too is most have nor be some as yourselves them that his yours he but myself yourselves have is do through will both its here by yours to more between does did more them while can then so because after a have up its into during or here myself only was only they up herself having both you such he ours has here of has while have few such too all themselves most was this been or as to been more with our at whom only we here our but were as yourselves because will yourselves same than those its further here she his ourselves be her so off her ours against have is having against where its now and more here those the your do be him will what too that all he each been my or your is while so did for same his of themselves to very nor their same
