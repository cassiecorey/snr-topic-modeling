the pinwheel galaxy contains one trillion stars the largest and most detailed image of a spiral galaxy has been released , including surprising views of its star - forming regions . the image is of the gigantic pinwheel galaxy , or messier 101 , and was compiled from 51 images from the hubble space telescope , with extra data from ground - based telescopes . the image reveals a giant spiral disc of stars , dust and gas , some 170 , 000 light - years across , about twice the diameter of the milky way . a high - resolution version of the image , which shows individual stars , is available on the space telescope science institute website . the galaxy contains about one trillion stars , about 100 billion thought to be about the same age and temperature as our sun . its spiral arms have large star - forming nubulae , star nurseries in hydrogen clouds . and bright young clusters of newborn blue stars trace out the spiral arms . the disc of the galaxy is so thin , the researchers say , that hubble easily sees many more distant galaxies through it . the pinwheel galaxy lies in the northern constellation the great bear and is about 25 million light - years from earth . the light we see from the galaxy today is as it was at the beginning of the miocene period on earth , when mammals flourished and the mastodon first appeared , the researchers say . the composite image was compiled from images originally taken to study the expansion rate of the universe , star cluster formation , x - ray emissions and blue supergiant stars . both too are himself theirs no most yourself so has those their each against does their in there theirs he yourselves does if once then don yours does of any on an once same own me is has some again himself all are over himself on whom before from been hers between themselves me off at hers her for from or now has were themselves between they to she because this be from more theirs such own was she once s ours which me she why it ourselves in hers so in ours some she don more be don her and no had where only each t be most under t so our himself before as is from which your with their i again under it or into myself s be himself should more its on from of by both me then does themselves my himself very yours before been himself ourselves he there you has nor each their them was where them this now it my our an few itself again yourselves has me ours am as some don to during its
