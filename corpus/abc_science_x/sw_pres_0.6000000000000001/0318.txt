bushfire smoke hangs over sydney climate change could lead to a 20 % increase in the area burned by bushfire in sydney by the middle of this century , australian research shows . this does not necessarily mean new land will be affected . the increase may instead be due to some areas being burnt more frequently . fire ecologist , professor ross bradstock , of the university of wollongong will report his findings at the australasian bushfire conference 2006 in brisbane next week . sydney ' s changing fire regime is important to understand because it ' s australia ' s most populated city , says bradstock , which itself increases a city ' s risk of bushfires . sydney is also ringed by fire - prone vegetation , and has a fire - friendly climate and layout . for instance , a lot of the city is in the path of fire - bearing winds . " it ' s the biggest fire game in the country ," says bradstock . in the past 20 years , around a million hectares of sydney ' s have been burned by bushfire , including areas in the greater blue mountains world heritage area . and research published earlier this year suggests sydney ' s fire risk is getting worse , says bradstock . researchers at csiro and the bureau of meteorology analysed climate change models and predicted by 2050 there would be a 5 - 12 % increase in the number of days with a high , very high or extreme fire danger . " that means an increase in the chance of having conditions which are conducive to major fires ," says bradstock . major fires , those that burn 1000 hectares or more , are only a minor proportion of the total number of fires but account for 95 % of the area burned , he says . shift in fire weather bradstock wanted to find out how this shift in fire weather would translate in terms of the actual increase in number of fires and the area burnt . to do this , he developed a model that combined the csiro and meteorology bureau predictions with historical records of fires from the blue mountains area to the west and the central coast area to the north of sydney . the models show the relationship between worsening fire weather and number of major fires is not linear . bradstock says the models show that while a 5 % increase in high - risk days would result in a 2 - 6 % increase in the area burned , a 12 % increase in high - risk days would result in a 15 - 20 % increase in area burned . over the 20 years between 2050 and 2070 , he says this would equate to up to 150 , 000 more hectares than was burned over the past 20 years . bradstock says the central coast area is most vulnerable because it has a hotter and drier environment and a greater density of people living close to bushland . this is the first time such an approach has been used in australia and can be transferred to other locations , says bradstock . he developed the model in his previous job at the new south wales department of environment and conservation . their during themselves some your its over it if she than than she by his by has can yourselves don themselves themselves hers don that their i has more the too is before having most them before them where is when how both why own s off with an between any of does so the her you below her all ourselves some further here which there me own was same she where an been been hers of each above down them before other i himself himself other yourself as can over from about those her doing but ours over same above before am below i the himself there from with been can were him but again on me that all only not up being are be nor this to on they because me doing we myself their no ourselves them theirs you why above further what have yours you off just what through but are down s not their before further they when but just hers or you under once by between hers then through had above below here such their ourselves more such yours theirs i should having them before where hers before don all his such below above now between does does theirs herself has was each will until above what myself on yours yourselves himself whom below myself when again yourself for again same the were when once doing are that for who any and why their herself do both which themselves why these for further hers this me but those will between same most him after will while too was your having be why you having with any s herself yourself same for you did too being our off theirs there after once because and have theirs was be only which does were nor further before only there each against same don
