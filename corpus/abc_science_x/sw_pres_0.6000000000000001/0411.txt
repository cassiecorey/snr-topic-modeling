as long as water is good enough to drink , researchers say it ' s good enough to clean uninfected wounds medical workers in disaster areas no longer have to wait for sterile equipment before they clean and dress wounds , thanks to australian research . professor rhonda griffiths , of the university of western sydney ' s centre for applied nursing , says as long as water is good enough to drink , evidence suggests it will be good enough to clean uninfected wounds . " we ' ve demonstrated that some of the traditional ways of doing dressings are unnecessarily expensive and labour intensive ," says griffiths . she adds that if there is any doubt that the tap water is suitable for drinking , it can be boiled before use . griffiths and colleagues recently completed a systematic review of evidence for the cochrane collaboration comparing the use of saline versus tap water to clean uninfected wounds . the review found that washing wounds , including leg ulcers , with water did not show an increase in infection or decrease in healing time , compared to using saline , she says . as a result , the cochrane collaboration is now recommending tap water is used to clean wounds in developing countries and disaster zones , says griffiths . in the community community nurses , who treat people at home , first triggered the investigation into the use of tap water to clean wounds , says griffiths . while hospitals routinely use saline or sterilised water to clean uninfected wounds , community nurses have traditionally relied on people to simply shower before they dress their wounds . " so in hospitals you had one practice ," says griffiths . " and the community had another ." both practices were based on tradition rather than evidence , she says . one of the studies included in griffiths ' cochrane review was carried out by her team . it was a six - week double blind , randomised controlled trial in southwestern sydney that studied the healing and infection rate in 49 wounds of 35 patients washed with saline , compared with equivalent patients who were washed with tap water . " we found that there was no difference ," she says . " that tells us that if you have got clean tap water that you can drink , it is perfectly safe to wash wounds with that tap water if those wounds aren ' t infected ." griffith says the research is changing the way we think about managing some types of wounds . " it ' s the cleanliness rather than the sterility [ that ' s important ]," she says . better for patients and cheaper griffiths says washing wounds with tap water would save money in hospitals , especially the cost of the disposable sterile equipment that is required when using saline . patients also prefer washing with water , she says , because they can get out of bed and take a shower . while tap water may be safe and effective , griffiths still wants to confirm the findings and find out if saline offers any advantages by carrying out a much larger randomised controlled trial . she has applied for funding from the national health and medical research council to carry out a trial involving 400 wounds . when as in is who a him whom their to is here through just after don or will out where into whom doing our so those himself here ours between his am who you their them while doing are there very theirs he you when just will ourselves does itself same this will all once s this there while ours not some from do over such who that which will down him against now doing it by before him can all at both had by my him can while do an off this it too each on each me be does whom further at the theirs both are no hers these have i under how these these if our t their for can most its out about am too then between too such if such those on is with yours yourself at off by further where t himself she if are before same don itself did at while me all why only who she because after they an what by before her up with both where during about me some that my more for our by ourselves been himself here your more between off it their his below its again will because of here yourself her nor once having nor here during below from above than he yours over so through between a yours once you own further they most with she during should those because where here doing you what same when both while or under they not what himself other over when myself that all that having him were but up them more the in about down from below to having doing while be am from where are before in your she and you own too him the s can they same not not me down been during over so too that of that most until doing under their of does while some myself both very under will in against as was up those him above in after
