how much old research is based on fraud ? details are emerging about the latest case , which involves papers in three medical journals a norwegian mouth cancer specialist has admitted to fabricating research data published in several international scientific magazines , in the latest fraud case to rock the medical research world . a doctor at the institute for cancer research at the norwegian radium hospital , dr jon sudb & oslash ;, has confessed to forging data used to document research published last october in the lancet as well as in two other articles . the revelation comes on the heels of the disclosure that south korea ' s celebrated cloning pioneer professor hwang woo - suk had faked research papers claiming breakthroughs in stem cell research . suspicion that sudb & oslash ;, 44 , had forged data in the lancet article surfaced earlier this month and several investigations have been launched into his conduct . " he has indicated that in addition to the article in the lancet , two of his other articles contained information in which the conclusions have no basis ," says sudb & oslash ;' s lawyer erling lyngtveit . the two other articles appeared in the new england journal of medicine in april 2004 and the journal of clinical oncology in march 2005 . " it appears that he started cheating a little bit , and then the deception got completely out of control in his last article in the lancet ," the lawyer adds . made - up study in the lancet article , the doctor maintained that anti - inflammatory drugs like aspirin were efficient in preventing mouth cancer , but they also increased the risk of cardiovascular disease . he based this conclusion on data from 908 fictitious patients , 205 of whom had been given the same date of birth . " this had nothing to do with money ," lyngtveit insists . " in different circumstances , his motives would be perceived as positive since they are what helps research to move forward : the desire to contribute to something , the yearning for fame and glory ," he says , adding however that " this got completely out of hand ". in sudb & oslash ;' s article in the new england journal of medicine , he claimed that the resection of the first cancerous cells in the oral cavity did not have an impact on the mortality rate in patients . according to his lawyer , he now admits he did not have the mortality statistics to back up that claim . sudb & oslash ;' s article in the journal of clinical oncology meanwhile discussed the possibility of calculating which heavy smokers would contract mouth cancer . he has now admitted that he had only taken blood tests from some of the patients , and not all of them as previously claimed , to check if they had continued smoking , lyngtveit says . over the past decade , sudb & oslash ; has published 38 articles in international scientific magazines , but his lawyer insists that " the forgery only occurred in three articles ". " sudb & oslash ; acted alone . his co - authors contributed to the articles in good faith ," he adds . the case has contributed to further weakening faith in research published in scientific reviews after the widely publicised hwang scandal . in 2005 hwang claimed to have derived 11 stem cell lines tailored to specific patients , which are believed to have the potential to reduce the risk of rejection of new organs . in 2004 , he said he had derived a stem cell from a human embryo . but after a month - long probe , a panel of experts from seoul national university found that hwang had created no stem cells of any kind and that his research data was fabricated . us research journal science retracted hwang ' s papers last week . the lancet meanwhile stated on its website earlier this week that " pending clarification , we now issue an expression of concern about the article by sudb & oslash ;". don we were these an he them such will while her until your up the yours himself up she not myself other below to yourselves yourselves t with nor theirs by on after during once have ourselves when because its ours once both why too about how was of some my now any hers and about our this can them its of do their having them of ours don been such after most but they themselves some below no for has here between me while nor by then has between below down you no other yourself down until to it then with very does for be here whom have she nor while its were yourself to which having at if just yourself now down only was which there that by before she what before did himself an same that i he am themselves until herself being each what where himself don not theirs my against while same until its in your at more too nor but up when to this your it doing during theirs in can me at each where is will don ourselves any some be an have t s who more if to over am theirs are during was too yourselves not below s during ours from with ourselves these can up whom our theirs me do you being don your no don no it over she ourselves did some them myself under on with you be me those here for too will yourself all very their all down only am now below yourself if where ourselves were their for other herself between their above at once just most than them at why yourselves ours just off do more with t just own while theirs very again there both up against who herself only here not same am because these when once further if very through with s does down but myself you over from under have on what does just own they then there more again here these above before as being yours below below his having i t about once each doing him against above she ours until has than just she had do herself our while during other yours up the his not why there because being are for don why about are each itself from or our hers after there
