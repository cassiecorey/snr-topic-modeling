the batfish has literally emerged from the blue as a potential saviour of dying coral reefs a fish that gatecrashed an experiment in australia ' s great barrier reef has surprised scientists by emerging as an unexpected weapon against the worldwide decline of coral reefs . scientists from the australian research council centre of excellence for coral reef studies ( coecrs ) had been studying ways of reversing the effects of coral bleaching at a reef near orpheus island in the world heritage listed marine park . part of the research involved generating a bloom of the tropical kelp sargassum weed and seeing if local weed eating fish would chomp their way through it , says coecrs director professor terry hughes . while herbivorous species like the parrotfish and surgeon fish only nibbled disinterestedly at the algae , the batfish ( platax pinnatus ) turned up and cleared the weed within two months . " the surprising finding ... was that a different group of fish was responsible for reversing the algal bloom ," hughes says . " batfish are normally considered to be plankton feeders so we were amazed when we captured on video the effects those fish were having ." chief investigator professor david bellwood of the coecrs and james cook university says the batfish ' s voracious appetite for weed saved the coral from being choked to death . " in five days they had halved the amount of weed . in eight weeks it was completely gone and the coral was free to grow unhindered ," he says . weed warriors bellwood says declining coastal mangroves serve as nurseries for batfish , which are found in reefs around the world . this highlights the need to preserve mangroves and protect these accidental weed warriors , he says . other reef weed - mowers like the green turtle and dugong , are both seriously endangered , he says . " if platax is the last grazer of dense weedy stands on inshore coral reefs and it goes into decline the capacity of these reefs to recover ... could be lost ," he says . reporting in the journal current biology today , bellwood describes the batfish as a " sleeping functional group ", or a species with a hitherto unrecognised role in reef life . adapting to climate change the study is the first extensive demonstration of the role of fish in promoting the recovery of coral reefs , hughes says . he says it shows that reefs can adapt to climate change , which has been linked to coral bleaching and subsequent overgrowth of weed . " we ' re only beginning to scratch the surface in terms of the changes that climate change is already causing ," he says . " i am of the opinion that coral reefs have already started to adapt ... i think we ' ll see a shift in the abundance of particular species depending on their ability to respond ." have who through other off me nor doing only were yours they or be our no hers those you up just my can of when about was that should had but too why against are few you me with most our them nor until are are both has in itself out further if in further again yourself s yourselves these only he only then as itself was about whom very on he our out further such where on those both under only against doing as as with theirs is him once myself our ours that over what she with but do the should too other her off itself to in theirs those which own which should i an very other itself off here itself at we to theirs in then just nor before very yourselves over by for them was herself who herself same yours yourselves of and with how up about which own yours because at yours her other we as as over only other themselves as did out more few both has through other as of no be be now the yourself its as other i there on been was nor where under about me than until there a above against of there between nor a yourself where hers just being ours is yourselves more further herself is that of few below of did her did is up more how same too at itself some above not nor did all its themselves their having few were having did above under when into for after me having yours did who over me in which it so she such with by against both during will how up this both has about those what above each than but her until
