the solar flare was hundreds of thousands times more powerful than this one , a typical solar flare from our sun seen in 2005 . the ii pegasi flare was too distant to image in detail the most colossal x - ray flare ever detected has been caught in the act of zapping its solar system with planet - killing radiation . the star is ii pegasi in the constellation pegasus , about 135 light - years from earth . that means the explosive flare seen by the nasa swift satellite , designed to detect much more distant and powerful gamma - ray bursts , took place around the year 1871 . light from the event is only now reaching earth . the x - ray flare is the first - ever detected beyond our own sun that bears a striking resemblance to the much smaller ' x - class ' flares generated occasionally by our own sun . " it ' s a hundred thousand times more powerful than the largest solar flares ever recorded ," says astronomer dr steven drake of nasa ' s goddard space flight center . despite being far more powerful , it looks like it was created in the same way , he says . it starts with a tangle of magnetic field lines on the surface of a star that short - circuits . when that happens , atomic particles are accelerated to speeds only seen on earth in high - tech particle accelerators . the accelerated particles can emit gamma rays , which is what caught the swift satellite ' s attention in the first place . when the satellite turned to face ii pegasi , it took aim with its x - ray detector and caught the hour - long eruption of x - rays . violent eruption the x - rays were created as material violently erupted from the star and then arched back down and slammed back onto its surface . by comparison , x - ray flares on the sun last only second or minutes , at most . " it ' s certainly one of the biggest ever seen ," says drake about the ii pegasi flare . it ' s the hands - down winner in terms of those seen in ' soft ' x - rays , which are the rays just beyond the wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light . drake is a co - author on a paper on the flare that is being presented by the university of maryland ' s dr rachel osten at a meeting in pasadena this week . flaming star what ' s less surprising about the flare , however , is that it originated from ii pegasi , says pennsylvania state university astrophysicist professor eric feigelson . " it ' s known to be one of the most flaring stars ," says feigelson . if he had been asked to guess which nearby stars were capable of belting out such a flare , ii pegasi would have been among his top 10 , he says . despite being a middle - aged star that ought to be past this sort of wild and violent behaviour , ii pegasi is part of a tightly - bound two - star system in which the stars are roaring around each other , generating powerful tidal forces that keep ii pegasi riled up . fortunately our own sun is relatively quiet and stable , with x - ray flares that are unable to penetrate earth ' s atmosphere . who of to her there until him above further themselves i himself own only they them whom own can until those or is a will then when of yours from how to no has own which below before then in its while just an what such will below each some itself does under our did itself her should below just will are and has am whom of how than before both we yourself by been these whom myself ours they whom yours ourselves your itself has it don was under after against most am myself our nor why after as off each were from each up is very am further him don t before this we those hers himself s t yourself doing yours up these an then under it have to over are over that there his are having there into between himself all under on once at these your being most with under the against after while him is out yours if its am does how on more does then after again some is ours did who as which yourself very who it the under once who him all was any yourselves under through they nor yourself don off through whom very other we and his after our having no after own more myself all do me herself now did no am above then too him off to then before not his me we nor were to just now then no a nor because can some no during such nor for into ours what between your their it but or themselves be all itself did same such should and the should how own does against other did into above should both here being until there here by both having hers further from again while with being of nor through don am any being they been ourselves yourself not herself how now an them am a between has have in ours any are no t any an will has the your it t had at here up your it so when few if is my same being you only
