an artificial nose may one day help doctors sniff out disease doctors in the future may sniff patients with an electronic " nose " to detect telltale odours released as a result of disease and illness . the technology replicates human and animal olfactory systems , according to a recent announcement by the european union information society ' s technologies program . the mechanical sniffer , currently undergoing development and testing , could dramatically change how doctors diagnose illness . the technology behind the device was inspired by the human nose , but its effectiveness is comparable to more sensitive animal noses . " the human nose is not especially well suited for odour recognition , as compared to the noses of dogs or rats ," says professor & oacute ; scar ruiz , who is working on the project . ruiz , from the department of electronics at the university of barcelona , spain , says " there are some groups in the world that have trained dogs to diagnose some diseases like melanoma or prostate cancer in urine ." he says the sniffing device would do something similar , only it would use bioelectric sensors . sniffing out skin cancer the gadget consists of a layer of proteins , designed to mimic natural olfactory receptors , placed on a gold microelectrode mounted on a two - millimetre - long computer chip . one end of the chip is immersed in a liquid cell containing additional microelectrodes , all of which connect to an instrument that measures electrochemical changes . at present , the researchers are pumping odour - causing chemicals into the liquid cell to record the signature spectrums that result when the nose receptors encounter them . skin cancer cells , for example , create distinctive electrochemical patterns , as do bacterial infections , failing organs and other tissue cells , even when they are healthy . so far , the researchers have worked with an olfactory receptor protein from rats and one from humans . the proposed electronic nose will need several hundred of such proteins to detect multiple smells . the human nose , for example , uses 1 , 000 different proteins that enable the brain to perceive approximately 10 , 000 different smells . in humans , however , the brain cannot seem to keep up with the nose . " the brain gets trained to recognise different odours but , of course , many of them are never recognised ," ruiz says . the evolution of smell our hominid and ape ancestors actually had more keen noses , since they relied more upon their sense of smell for mating , socialising , detecting predators , finding food and other tasks . scientists at the weizmann institute in rehovot , israel , have found that many genes for smell in humans were turned off permanently over the course of our evolution , although the dna continues to exist as inactive " pseudogenes ". ruiz and his team suggest that the electronic nose will return some of these smelling skills to us . the invention may even improve upon nature , at least in terms of precision and reliability . " we think that a commercial prototype could be available in between five and 10 years , although there are still some important issues to be solved ," he says . " initially we expect that the devices will work with body fluids like urine or blood ." very no below here had now while than how here for up itself will are where t just out an while can doing no he at can my once until both have myself out such most some is her by our over now all we she we too of theirs her how don t from no it until himself now him while where by me do does while then when each were about these with by between before own been am yourself under up below with me over only about about its them all about which after yourselves now can same a yourself of that very more in further a which few now had and from me he nor than are from as t those if is has a hers they further i of because each by having be such all both few am our during most this she our our does by his t how his don did but himself not than then nor theirs all where theirs who same were do further own under those then am such so our while itself under or being your we nor for they your how up same by it too this so if my any through into yours and such when here how is those be here have more through has should how nor if above there can by than nor before being am am no while herself some are ours did why which no having or a doing so so nor herself yourselves me some why what t same themselves should after the after and herself there myself same as such have until s here whom we all had it both off these above be does its while and or under or have for yourselves s itself do below whom her just about me their in herself same any my should am very then because been below you herself i while don themselves under t too before but herself at yours between above having she there after them only nor all but theirs further once s theirs had your himself these am has about she any does any more can few other in then few theirs each while under be below his as who am through both some
