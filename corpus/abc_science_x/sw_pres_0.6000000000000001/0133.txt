stem cells harvested from young women ' s menstrual blood have a longer lifespan than those from older women japanese researchers have harvested stem cells from human menstrual blood , a medical conference has heard . the researchers say these stem cells could be coaxed into forming specialised heart cells , which might one - day be used to treat failing or damaged hearts . at the meeting of the american college of cardiology , dr shunichiro miyoshi reported that he and his colleagues at keio university in tokyo collected menstrual blood from six women and harvested stem cells that originated in the lining of the uterus . they were able to obtain about 30 times more stem cells from menstrual blood than from bone marrow , miyoshi says . the stem cells were then cultured in a way to induce them to become heart cells . after five days about half of the cells contracted " spontaneously , rhythmical and synchronously , suggesting the presence of electrical communication " between the cells , miyoshi says . that is to say , they behaved like heart cells . the researcher explains that already stem cells derived from bone marrow have improved heart function , mainly by producing new blood vessels rather than new heart - muscle tissue . he emphasises that it is important that these cells be obtained from younger patients , because they would have a longer lifespan than cells harvested from older donors . been the have when on this ours all after being ours are were where at about its it under can here we most did it whom is was will so their do who i its is both no has me being where there was no yourselves i some we yourself does but t can having at no his each they with further own him having itself why me can no they down yourselves she those theirs these more do more ours yourselves the a he a have because themselves under up any out some these until which under hers we i own himself theirs our here will has during what be only of until below herself in at that his him very was only about you its did are he from any so himself but do his in an over now most over about doing we has did had just what just hers don below
