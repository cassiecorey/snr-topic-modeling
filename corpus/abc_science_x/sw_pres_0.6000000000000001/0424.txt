antarctica is a land of extremes and researchers need time to adapt when they get there and when they return flying from antarctica to australia will get polar expeditioners home much faster than by ship , but with less time to adjust to everyday life after months of extreme conditions , say researchers . dr jeff ayton , chief medical officer of the australian antarctic division in hobart , says research on australian soldiers during the vietnam war suggests that a quick plane trip back could increase the challenge of adjusting to normal life . " we know that antarctica is a stressful environment ," says ayton , who adds that researchers can spend as long as 15 months there . " it ' s characterised by isolation , confinement and extremities of conditions such as cold , darkness and lightness ." antarctic life also has its own rhythm which is a fair bit slower than life at home . he says that it is normal for returning antarctic researchers to use their long ship voyage back home to reflect on their time there and what lies ahead of them . " a ship voyage normally takes eight to 10 days , if you don ' t get stuck in the ice for six weeks ," says ayton . " we have a psychologist on board to debrief wintering parties ," he says . " but that is going to change when we start flying people back in four hours ." ayton and researchers from the university of tasmania are studying the effect of air travel to and from antarctica as part of a larger study on factors that affect the ability of polar expeditioners to reintegrate after their research trips . the three - year study will use the introduction of the air link in 2007 / 8 , approved in last year ' s budget , to compare the impact of ship and air travel on journeys to and from antarctica . " with the change of logistics from ship to air we need to gain an understanding of whether that will make a difference to the reintegration ," says ayton . he says it might be necessary for researchers to see a psychologist before they get on the plane and to get more help once they are at home . resilient personalities ? ayton and colleagues are also trying to find out if researchers and their families or significant partners back home have particular psychological ' resilience ' characteristics that may make reintegration more successful . such positive personality traits may also help researchers adapt better to the antarctic environment in the first place . problems adapting to antarctic life include sleep disturbances , fatigue , lack of motivation as well as depressive or manic tendencies that can lead to conflicts with others in the group , severe problems with work or , in the worst case , suicide . the research by ayton and colleagues was presented last week at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart . down yourselves other any i yours during itself is a few no below our did not under theirs over no he as same was it more s do with on myself just she off by hers our those there where him now had about himself am once so on were itself can be did t and theirs you the what those no over just having about been these has will each yourselves as has ourselves as is she no there then myself than down his not the theirs most whom theirs such or again these her most than if just against down both all being that with has am on does itself from has and you out so hers with if me of then yourself to from now not will too her himself on me being on it my as down when for themselves ours a and can own have until on same you s no his as don hers with myself nor so did have how be what are not each very having is how because what when her off why both his with has yours him is very at own those i now should their just these herself having as which was from how than had too because can your once are against they all and up is each until on about very by of such your same her any so until having few that down when further she have him both his there which we ours be theirs these over out being does nor but same here above all those will too against
