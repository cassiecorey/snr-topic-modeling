new guidelines recommend 30 chest compressions to every two breaths to improve blood flow to the heart and brain new advice on how best to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) suggests doubling the number of chest compressions , australian emergency medicine experts say . this should mean more sustained blood flow , especially to the heart and brain . the move , which was announced recently by the australian resuscitation council , is now in line with international consensus and best evidence , say the experts . the new protocol recommends 30 chest compressions to every two breaths when resuscitating infants , children or adults . the pattern of two ventilations then 30 compressions should continue , to achieve a rate of 100 compressions a minute , says council chair and university of western australia lecturer in emergency medicine , associate professor ian jacobs . he hopes the one conversion rate for all basic life support rescue attempts and patients would be easier to remember and increase the likelihood people will at least try cpr . the new protocol also recommends compressions be delivered faster and harder , people should visualise the centre of the chest and compress there , interruptions should be minimised , a defibrillator attached urgently , other ventilation avoided and says any attempt at resuscitation is better than no attempt . kelli mitchener from the australian college of critical care nurses and a nurse at melbourne ' s austin hospital , says the new ratio means better blood flow . " by increasing the number of compressions it means there will be fewer pauses where blood circulation is not occurring , hopefully improving the patient ' s outcome ," she says . the changes are based on a review of published evidence which found giving more compressions may help save more lives and a consensus developed by the international liaison committee on resuscitation published in the journals resuscitation and circulation . " there are 30 , 000 - 35 , 000 cardiac arrests annually in australia - due to a heart attack , drowning or drug overdose for example - but less than half receive cpr before an ambulance arrives and most [ who don ' t ] will die ," says jacobs . the guidelines , which are available online , are for the public but include sections for doctors , hospitals and ambulance officers . st john ambulance begins teaching the new techniques in its first aid classes from april . off myself himself any what during been who i no after any has ourselves we when that how she above yourselves theirs there yourselves the into myself these most down over very now or ours doing don same s am at under can has her don she but here who than when and did few above until him in they has do when but that who few other most our itself yourself with me by very am such itself who while there i them was below t him no very some after how ours the other who so i an under at who on am above off who can while i himself he most out theirs nor those out against its t who she him such having doing between yours down about as just just he over his such t him over not their they too over his to will through after which am a himself who will my my having some after does our which out him itself between me my above herself all into t or each he we in myself between will our him does not whom same has me it because its i against any about who she just its been which themselves during such are there no does below an she will be our my than nor my than s did yours ours few should just such very who such an these whom where at now further after after should was were will but in is can be below myself me was were below how before her because where same who before there after both only but just no how theirs was what when
