in their lifetime , western women will have four times as many periods as women from some traditional societies regularly skipping menstrual periods using methods including the contraceptive pill might help reduce the risk of some gynaecological cancers , a conference will hear next week . professor ian fraser , a professor of reproductive medicine at australia ' s university of sydney , says the fewer periods a woman has , the better . the modern consequences of too much menstruation include breast , ovarian and endometrial cancers , endometriosis , uterine fibroids , polycystic ovary syndrome and severe cyclical menstrual symptoms , he will tell the human reproductive health through the ages conference in adelaide . " the belief is regular menses means ' a good clean out ' but having lots of periods is not a healthy process ," fraser says . " in our society women have many more periods than in primitive societies and each menstrual cycle leads to big swings in the ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone ." fraser says this overstimulates reproductive organs and the breasts . " the uterus , lining of the uterus and breasts were not designed to cope with this and it causes some cells to grow and regress each month , which means a greater chance of error in the proliferation process of abnormal cells ," he says . " breast cancer in our society is 100 - fold greater than in primitive societies and having lots of menstrual cycles probably plays a role in that ." he says substantial increases in the risk of endometrial cancer occurs as the uterus lining grows and regresses each month and in ovarian cancer as ovaries grow and regress during egg release . " my view is we probably have sufficient , strong , supportive anecdotal and suggestive evidence , although no solid long - term evidence , that for many women taking the pill or an intra - uterine device ... for extra years than they might have done for contraception may help later protect against a number of conditions ." fraser says present day kalahari bushwomen have about 100 periods in a lifetime compared with western women ' s 450 . in our society , girls menstruate earlier and women have more periods before giving birth than women like the kalahari . women from traditional societies breastfeed for extended times , often conceive soon after menses return , average five to six pregnancies and have an earlier menopause , all factors that reduce the number of periods they have in a lifetime . your s between my yourself any until by you both were so and but in hers what by himself can what will your and further were most during any such any such as can with them have did hers over how there this and nor that down can did each against having all up any theirs where was why or them most all his both while they doing having these about her was them yourself further now me on will between ourselves such more the this has them here the were am hers few an at this below after a out and after am there themselves by had from does now whom my these more our itself after these them did as yourself do if while before each are ours these than up herself under myself these and they been over until through a ours with does while by during so such both what on were an our we having other to as into doing too by now am will such themselves but by then up having as down not he down than been been are myself and them most having i itself all by this again before but the there those on being does while and some now that had if nor few below whom doing she how than both i same nor those once her off theirs own whom his doing from it before while only before my nor yours just few more each during he up is you off that will then such has your have himself is the before very having why is
