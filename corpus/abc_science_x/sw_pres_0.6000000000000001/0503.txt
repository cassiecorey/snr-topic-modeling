it ' s just not the same any more ... dogs feel especially intense jealousy pangs in a ' love triangle ' involving their owner and another more recently introduced person or animal , a new study suggests . the finding suggests dogs may also experience pride , embarrassment , shame and other secondary emotions outside the basic emotions such as anger , anxiety and surprise . scientists previously thought only humans and chimpanzees showed behaviours linked to secondary emotions . a genetic propensity for jealousy may even run as deep as a dog ' s ancient wolf ancestors , the researchers say . " i would definitely think you would find jealousy in wolves ," says lead researcher dr paul morris . " for example , sexual jealousy would be an extremely powerful motivator in the wild state . jealousy would also relate to position in hierarchy and alliances between animals within a pack ." morris , a university of portsmouth psychologist and a member of the university ' s centre for the study of emotion , and colleague christine doe studied 1000 domestic animal owners in the south of england . the researchers asked the pet owners to report observations of both primary and secondary emotions in their animals , which included cats , pigs , horses , rabbits , rats and hamsters , as well as dogs . all the animals received high scores for secondary emotions , with over 80 % of owners saying their dogs showed signs of jealousy . when morris and doe interviewed participants about their observations , owners repeatedly said their pooches seemed jealous when they introduced a new person or animal to the family . lost love morris also studied the phenomenon directly with his own two dogs , silver and jessie . he went out of his way to shower silver with attention , and then only occasionally gave jessie her usual pat on the head . jessie showed her teeth and snarled , but contained her anger and tried to push her way back into the mini pack . " jealousy is at its heart related to the real or anticipated loss of love , affection and attention ," says morris . " dog jealousy is different to human jealousy , in that it is tied to the here and now ; dog jealousy occurs only in the presence of the interloper . so when i talk about dog jealousy , i see it as a much more primitive and hugely less elaborate version of human jealousy ." a range of emotions marc bekoff , a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the university of colorado , is the author of numerous studies and books on animal emotions , most recently two books co - authored with primate researcher dr jane goodall . he agrees with the new findings . " i believe that dr morris is right . dogs and other animals do exhibit secondary emotions such as jealousy ," he says . " i ' ve studied the emotional lives of animals for more than 25 years and was pleased to see his results ." morris , who will present his work on canine jealousy at next month ' s british association for the advancement of science ( ba ) festival of science in norwich , next plans to study evidence of guilt in dogs and pride in horses . with after from his there that as because any it she had which himself how they t than having will down how will she from her between don in some through is s will again into why off can is while herself then her then been s am over with which too themselves for had an now both same during theirs was while had will or which you doing when through ourselves no an as yourself are this whom those both there should the me up why each their herself not after myself am themselves she ours each any we being t and up why not t to an can at my why s on your ourselves up but if more to and itself be on such i s from should not because during before but this into his her more with where had your now no while has itself once whom why be for both do down it from an over of ourselves where above she had from been his when that that yourselves t who hers yourself few or now and it above theirs theirs for their until against their don was be it so he you its that into under against have they were if more in the by below where all are about it these few be they what does any should who be yourself we that himself no our himself at be the t him each then there you be against in off we before then you each has some too to no no now her had s their nor will we whom those been after had her does up an not some what when until the for which same again herself each they these am before of been her does in again that up being are against on and or not this again these itself your that will it did same now doing him being some what what are we as these to our their been themselves as theirs up over again before because both during did we those on because they each from are
