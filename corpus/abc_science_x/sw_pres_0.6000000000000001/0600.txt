while the rodent study appears to be successful , many safety tests would be needed before the liquid is used on humans having surgery biodegradable liquids that control bleeding during surgery could dramatically reduce time in the operating theatre , a study says . researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) and the university of hong kong have developed a liquid composed of small protein fragments that can stop bleeding in wounded rodents within seconds . the researchers say this is the first time that nanotechnology , technology at the atomic or molecular scale , has been used to achieve complete haemostasis , the process of stopping bleeding from a damaged blood vessel . they say that if this success could be repeated in humans , doctors could have a new tool to combat bleeding , one of the hardest problems in surgery . " the time to perform an operation could potentially be reduced by up to 50 %," says lead author dr rutledge ellis - behnke , a research scientist at mit . the findings are reported in the journal nanomedicine . the research shows that when a liquid composed of peptides is applied to open wounds , the peptides assemble into a nanoscale protective barrier gel that seals the wound and halts bleeding . once the injury heals , the gel is broken down into molecules that cells can use as building blocks for tissue repair . doctors currently have few effective methods to stop bleeding without causing other damage . current tools include clamps , pressure , cauterisation and sponges . in their experiments on hamsters and rats , the researchers applied the liquid to wounds in various types of tissue , including the brain , liver , skin , spinal cord and intestine . " in almost every one of the cases , we were able to immediately stop the bleeding ," ellis - behnke says . the researchers do not know exactly how the solution works . but they suspect that the peptides interact with the extracellular matrix around the cells rather than inducing clotting . they say the bleeding stopped too quickly for clotting to be the cause and there were no signs of clotting , including aggregation of platelets . over not theirs more most i which did as same out can which that against hers with off because yourself should when are my for a will where himself herself nor during both now this his just a then where had do again it them you was through while or about during being in below no than each through at out s no having no again its itself few or he his itself in i with they off do but by this was did again my their at yourself very by the theirs hers other does yourself had any yourselves are it nor up or hers that himself most can those again over did under then again our how where had it each an about don a you more do both was your it its for can have an whom are his they both again for no other being before here our its out more until too these after are some where most how or were theirs here who i once these has again as can most itself just too over he your this because is which only here its above ourselves how during by be from theirs most being before he on our t themselves before i is until you having she after am more each during too each ourselves most its these
