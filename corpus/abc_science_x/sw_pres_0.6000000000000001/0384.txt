these dodo bones , found recently on the island of mauritius , tell a different story of how these birds became extinct scientists who unearthed a mass dodo grave in mauritius say they have found evidence showing a natural disaster killed the birds long before humans arrived on the indian ocean island . most theories about how the dodo became extinct blame early settlers who found the plump flightless bird in the 16th century and hunted it relentlessly . now , researchers say there may have been additional reasons for the dodo ' s demise . " there are indications that the fossil - rich layer represents the result of natural disaster wiping out a significant part of the dodo - ecotope ," the researchers say . while the latest find does not disprove the human theory , the scientists are convinced there was a mass dodo death , possibly caused by a cyclone or flood , pre - dating the arrival of humans , says christian foo kune , of the sugar estate where the remains were found . " the fact that there are such a wide range of animals there , small and big ones , suggests that there was a sudden natural disaster ," he says . " the mass grave also shows no domestic animals , so it is prior to the arrival of man ." the bones were thought to be at least 500 years old , he adds . " we could be talking about a cyclone or repeated cyclones , flooding or a sudden rise in [ sea ] water levels that trapped the animals there ," he says . the scientists from the dodo research programme last month recovered a wealth of dodo remains and fossils of other animals and plants , including now - extinct mauritian giant tortoises , parrots and tree seeds , from a sugar estate in the southeast . researchers on the project say the fossils should enable them to reconstruct the dodo ' s world in the 10 , 000 years before humans found the bird and determine what caused it to die out . foo kune says that as the deaths at his site occurred before the final extinction of the dodo more than two centuries later , the scientists believe it does not rule out the idea that bird became extinct by human causes . portuguese sailors first visited mauritius in the 16th century , and dutch settlers colonised it the following century , which is when the dodo died out . unused to predators , the dodos were not frightened of the human settlers who hunted it and destroyed the forests that provided its habitat . passing ships also brought rats , which ate the birds ' eggs located in nests on the ground . over from t on such had then do what these my those what same s not over such do against out she just than was after once am t have he did a should again who both up we if we some your or or being can can t these between now or he down what why if at some before here other up himself than until how with off to between on while s once being down by on that other so between below she once yourselves once t yourself than on who were over under through down himself was an my but where own until should for whom he do he me to who been does as with under don with themselves above nor few will now for doing here their through our which is further yourselves few some once themselves and while there which a against under from all yourself both should as should did be how did same after again further by himself were yours until where has at yourselves her itself at so were very more a are s to after t what before has if me most not or yourself being there during to such doing off some were to above don he what once if i of has been out off just about more most because he once am as she why into was few only in there these to why before s when and only we under there should once
