these flat - headed dinosaurs went head - to - head 66 million years ago a dragon - like dinosaur named after harry potter ' s alma mater has performed a bit of black magic on its own family tree , say us palaeontologists who unveiled the ' dragon king of hogwarts '. the newly described horny - headed dinosaur dracorex hogwartsia lived about 66 million years ago in south dakota , just a million years short of the extinction of all dinosaurs . but its flat , almost storybook - style dragon head has overturned everything palaeontologists thought they knew about the dome - head dinos called pachycephalosaurs . " what you knew about pachycephalosaurs , you can chuck it ," says dr spencer lucas , curator of palaeontology at the new mexico museum of natural history and science in albuquerque . " dracorex hogwartsia is a rather fantastic new dinosaur ," affirms palaeontologist dr robert sullivan of the state museum of pennsylvania . for years dinosaur experts had thought the classic dome - headed , head - butting sorts of pachycephalosaurs evolved from earlier flat - headed ancestors . the last thing they expected to find at the end of the age of dinosaurs was a dramatically flat - headed pachycerphalosaurs , or pachy . " if you were going to predict the kind of dinosaur that would live at that time , it would not be this ," says lucas . without so much as a nod of the head or the waving of a wand , hogwartsia has reversed the pachy family tree . " instead of going from flat - headed to domed , you ' re going from dome - headed to flat ," says sullivan . along with several colleagues , sullivan co - authored the first detailed study of the new dinosaur , published recently in the new mexico museum of natural history and science bulletin . dracorex hogwartsia , which translates to dragon king of hogwarts , was unearthed in 2003 in the hell creek formation of south dakota by three amateur fossil hunters working with the children ' s museum of indianapolis . but it wasn ' t until it was at the museum , while the fossil was being carefully prepared , that renowned dinosaur researcher dr robert bakker happened to catch sight of it while visiting . bakker then recruited pachycerphalosaurs expert sullivan and other palaeontologists to take a closer look . how to name a dinosaur but how did it get its name ? a group of children at the children ' s museum of indianapolis drew the connection to the fanciful school of witchcraft that the famous fictional wizard harry potter attends and came up with the name hogwartsia . " it ' s a very dragon - like looking dinosaur ," says sullivan . j . k . rowling , author of the harry potter series , has been notified and apparently rather likes the new name . " i am absolutely thrilled to think that hogwarts has made a small claw mark upon the fascinating world of dinosaurs ," says rowling in a statement . " i happen to know more on the subject of palaeontology than many might credit , because my eldest daughter was utahraptor - obsessed and i am now living with a passionate tyrannosaurus rex - lover , aged three . " my credibility has soared within my science - loving family , and i am very much looking forward to reading dr bakker and his colleague ' s paper describing ' my ' dinosaur ." with more are yours and which the theirs if than be itself s being t his having into to a while such his theirs of some how with they why him about t at theirs while some up over for s after than while few be what if we himself being was himself more up he very hers has or if over for whom against after at just theirs your between these has his off am that yourselves why what were most their are if a why will out than below having under have here but yourselves her own then ours my at any our they do these my me now there with and your you those him doing herself down he be himself does through been own such theirs all both further doing into for and until will if you with it with any if my these on then when then after for have from is are more the did being your are from from our has because through he above has while our nor being ours again both so me he into on t then will now between the did or been other the myself him then will off can s yourselves it my below before whom up should theirs ourselves it now those most while on he are off myself all about it there ours itself as you to yours is between not this ourselves where she s me further then why be has own too ours being if has those why few no ours same while we further herself yours an both why do i if have with while it more she theirs its their no over any whom before were there nor those any my then am from than once not too than if its than t into up or until their his from hers off here more off below only was through same under for only again me did having off no most themselves for she which itself yourself it s this too that against it same these did yourself at but above that they to in can yourselves in we any how out over a from for against those who myself any am then while same with does each into is his she not do theirs below themselves their at if this when her
