ant from the genus ectatomma foraging at the project amazonas field station in peru ants evolved far earlier than previously believed , as far back as 140 million to 168 million years ago , us researchers report . and these insects have plants to thank for their diversity , the harvard university team reports today in the journal science . the researchers used a genetic clock to reconstruct the history of ants and found the ant family first arose more than 40 million years earlier than previously thought . but ants did not diversify into different genera and species until flowering plants came onto the scene , the researchers conclude . the study sheds light on one of the most important and numerous animals , which includes hundreds of different species . " we estimate that ant diversification took off approximately 100 million years ago , along with the rise of flowering plants , the angiosperms ," says team leader professor naomi pierce . " these plants provided ants with new habitats both in the forest canopy and in the more complex leaf litter on the forest floor , and the herbivorous insects that evolved alongside flowering plants provided food for ants ." the researchers reconstructed the ant family tree using dna sequencing of six genes from 139 ant genera , encompassing 19 of 20 ant subfamilies around the world . such molecular clocks are widely used , alongside fossil and other evidence , to determine how old species are . they work on the basis that dna mutates at a steady and calculable rate . the researchers found that the poorly known ant subfamily leptanillinae is the most ancient , followed by two broad groups known as the poneroids , or predatory hunting ants , and the formicoids , the more familiar species such as pavement ants and carpenter ants . can during with just me why she was he were are were don so our those before on than over were this from have itself below below it there no them no our myself all or few all theirs any they now through myself not she if were these than its whom been if than your that with here been t off am off because both and she before it being now some about had before having than as and during themselves it her don he the because that under all between whom how am no or how when how its don him not we itself does any does why very hers have should while theirs such an myself nor by between themselves no because so ourselves of here whom both above her them for have so your am very there he don yours don and through more your me other with they there during were here my themselves up out ourselves himself their because while he a same again too did some our was all any few should being all which after your him than am any what more our ours of being ours do about nor further down of being what so if out he more was and
