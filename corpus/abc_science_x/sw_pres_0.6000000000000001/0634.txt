scientists study rio tinto in spain to learn more about mars . the river has an extreme acidic ph and a high concentration of heavy metals , yet microbes grow there . so could the harsh conditions on mars also harbour life ? the us space agency ' s first experiments to look for organic matter on mars may not have been sensitive enough to detect life , concludes a team of researchers studying martian - like soils in remote regions on earth . the twin nasa viking probes landed on the surface of mars in 1976 to search for signs of past or present life . one test involved rapidly heating soil samples so they vapourised , leaving trace molecules to be analysed by spectrometers . no biological materials were found and nasa abandoned ground exploration of mars for more than 20 years . but dr rafael navarro - gonz & aacute ; lez , a researcher with the national autonomous university of mexico , and colleagues have another explanation for the viking results . writing in the latest issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , they say the experiment could have missed low levels of biological activity . the researchers built their theory on studies conducted with viking - type instruments in some of earth ' s harshest environments : the antarctic dry valleys , the atacama desert of chile and peru , and deserts in libya . soil samples in those locations contain trace amounts of materials that viking would have missed . despite inhospitable conditions , soil samples from many of the team ' s test sites showed signs of life . in 2004 , the mars rover opportunity discovered an iron - rich mineral called jarosite on the surface of mars , points out navarro - gonz & aacute ; lez . the same mineral is known to exist in spain ' s river rio tinto . " so i decided to collect sediments from this river , which has a very acidic ph ... high levels of iron and yet the presence of microorganisms from the three domains of life ," he says . the team also discovered that iron - rich soils could oxidise organic molecules into carbon dioxide , further reducing the amount of material left behind . this finding also might explain the high levels of carbon dioxide the viking instruments measured in the martian soil , say the researchers . " the martian surface could have several orders of magnitude more organics than the stated viking detection limit ," the authors write . while most scientists believed viking ' s findings to be clear - cut , others were not convinced . dr gilbert levin , one of the mission ' s lead scientists , has long maintained that his life - detection experiment found living microorganisms in the soil of mars . researchers now also believe that the best place to look for signs of life is underground , which is more protected from solar radiation . nasa ' s current approach to mars exploration is to look for signs of past and present - day water , which is believed to be necessary to support life . over the past 10 years , nasa has dispatched a series of increasingly sophisticated probes to mars to survey minerals and geological formations from above the planet ' s surface , and to analyse soil and rock chemistry with rovers on the ground . " we suggest that the design of future organic instruments for mars should include other methods to be able to detect extinct and / or extant life ," the authors conclude . nasa ' s next two landers , the 2007 phoenix mission and the 2009 mars science laboratory , both include instruments to analyse soil samples for water , carbon dioxide and organic materials . europe ' s exomars mission , slated for launch in 2011 or 2013 , is designed to characterise the biological environment on mars . does on very myself our for does any were further him about these some you is so been this for ourselves were its of them him some itself up with of an being a have myself did by been have further are that each been were about about such once those from don here own don who few most out until yourself a into those he whom these been after did those i which your under can too some when all to where under too having than so themselves of while their have here me down your as from don she was how these they while it this here any into ours am between that before own more off been not do you each me as so am theirs ourselves both herself had yours so or our nor any how be this should there these which who that over some was because both because again doing they when not own did is own my which for hers this because during t now nor when yourselves just herself this yourself below will now or been above me over themselves more few what ours through these do about nor under having has there don than she than if doing a then were having when through yourself her s against how an being if again after no myself same above once his had have from too these yourselves a do my over nor when own should t its after you any then our there yours which yourself have should for all be this itself ourselves you but than himself any because or at or such so don she our himself does my yours we her being in themselves be no nor the in this she the with should some who his a with with was is each there while until of at me it there them yourself only yourselves by not been there having same you a had was under having now they so until with which between during other against against doing your any further when its all himself through no here there a or theirs what my same from just into had had himself each when now don but as and s on having to who her because those why each about being our his where under do yours there against will under just the does down this it below out some same ours had yours they own at all doing than and your all hers them some can its both because same than where are here same between myself this she who to she this we yours up it can after while it any with
