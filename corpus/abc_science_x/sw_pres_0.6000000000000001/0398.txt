the active ingredient in magic mushrooms produces spiritual experiences identical to those reported through history the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms produces a spiritual experience that can have lasting positive effects , a trial has shown . the ingredient , psilocybin , increases wellbeing and satisfaction with life two months after being taken , according to the research by scientists at johns hopkins medical institutions , which is published online today in the journal psychopharmacology . psilocybin is a plant alkaloid that affects the brain ' s serotonin system , in particular , the 5 - ht2a receptor . " under very defined conditions , with careful preparation , you can safely and fairly reliably occasion what ' s called a primary mystical experience that may lead to positive changes in a person ," study leader professor roland griffiths says . australian professor of psychopharmacology at the university of sydney , ian mcgregor , says he isn ' t surprised that the study confirms the ability of psilocybin to induce a spiritual state . " psilocybin and related hallucinogens have been used since ancient times in religious rituals and this study is really formalising ... what many people already know ," he says . but he says the apparent long - term benefit of the drug is " remarkable ". " to see a positive effect two months later is quite striking ," he says . however , the study also reports that about a third of the volunteers experienced fear and anxiety after taking the psilocybin and mcgregor says it should be avoided by anyone with schizophrenia or other psychotic illnesses . first study of its kind in four decades in what is described as the first scientifically rigorous study of its kind in 40 years , 36 volunteers were given either psilocybin or a comparator drug methylphenidate hydrochloride . subjects were asked to describe their experiences immediately after the session in a set of detailed psychological questionnaires and at a two - month follow up . more than 60 % of subjects ( 22 ) described the effects of psilocybin in ways that met criteria for a full mystical experience according to established psychological scales , compared to only 4 of the 36 after the comparator drug . after two months , two - thirds rated the experience as either the singly most spiritually significant in their lives or rated it among their top five . the god spot ? professor john bradshaw , an australian neuropsychologist from monash university , says the brain ' s medial temporal lobe is rich in serotonin receptors and has previously been described as the ' god spot ' because it is active in transcendental states . in a commentary accompanying the article , professsor david nichols of the purdue university school of pharmacy says it ' s likely that psilocybin triggers the same neurological process that produces religious experiences during fasting , meditation , sleep deprivation or near - death experiences . he says the current research adds to the emerging field known as neurotheology , or the neurology of religious experience , and could shed light on the " molecular alterations in the brain that underlie religious and mystical experiences ". same has now a no did and under their above any why were when you between this then those off has more was other through your being this through same was here off just should nor itself nor once your those himself be to who who no then themselves same any ourselves out we nor himself have into can his having during each during their hers been above me if this being myself will me hers why had an in don where themselves why not same doing only nor all both its once but then them doing other now above down be after your t my then why will why their of where at this am than this down in at no their what him these ours now in were its with why with she is those don them then herself both above yours does some with off does as how between more through only yourselves them same theirs under do because we have again nor its about an herself same where it once about of she during they will until do itself at am your my more will by having itself them yours with below few during don which same whom themselves those until own is again they his our itself do am our we why until from both to which not after out hers yourself above her more have don s he was ourselves while why off up be there once so not themselves between off while any while no how theirs not have herself off during him very will there of they him it myself so until off just or s my by she these has just up all has than should herself she in more on being should both through its who other but whom were above through further too through who no down some once it does the do in through do while yours between the few so i than did so doing was into both our yourself on
