the technique may one - day be used to search earthquake rubble for survivors , the researchers say a laser - like beam of light shone at a unique solid makes the material appear to disappear , according to a new study . the effect , reported in a recent issue of the journal nature materials , occurs at infrared light wavelengths , so it can ' t be seen with the human eye . "[ but ] if it worked in the visible light with molecules that make up your hand , when the laser hit your hand , your hand would go transparent ," says team member professor chris phillips , a physicist at imperial college london . " and then if you turned the laser up a little more , the scene you ' d see through your hand would become brighter ," as the effect amplifies light in the beam , he says . phillips and his colleagues from the university of neuch & acirc ; tel , switzerland , think the method could one day work in visible light and lead to new technologies that help see through rubble to search for victims at a disaster site or observe internal body parts obscured by bone . the scientists accomplished their feat with materials used to make semiconductor chips . normally , electrons that make up atoms in these materials interact with light beams in a benign way . but phillips and his team re - engineered the material to contain artificial atoms , specially patterned crystals a few billionths of a metre long . because the atoms are artificial , the scientists could adjust the activity of the electrons , which have wavelike characteristics . when the light beam was shone onto the material , it influenced the wavelike patterns of the electrons inside the artificial atoms so that they cancelled each other out and created a new , transparent material that was half matter and half light . the scientists went on to amplify the light beam , even though 80 % of the artificial atoms stayed in a state of so - called low excitation . this contradicts a theory posed by albert einstein that says in order to amplify the light in a laser beam , the majority of the atoms must be in state of high excitation . " they have shown this can now be implemented in a solid - state medium , which could be very important for more practical applications ," says lene vestergaard hau , professor of applied physics at harvard university . in the future , the researchers aim to become better at controlling and amplifying the light beam so that they may not need a specially patterned structure to make the see - through effect work . has more ours below other further him between herself an why a as or is s themselves herself themselves nor same of about which again about hers during other both nor that each be to its don other their he ourselves into but that s itself who yourself these these its should what above if why hers was where over once who before its he then did some where down out both when doing about am by not at now where the after its in after if him while into through be yourselves to an myself s t for out if having t ours she own not through with them for don ourselves further than then her or too only she during when under have have once below do an any the these during should after yourself whom on myself these itself when during below during was myself if in to himself against that she did out same been while up theirs have themselves down his into me was having in under doing i under a to your for or each her its on through after having themselves now if some to what no are those very further am by not most off off above these nor he off there having of should own in we herself both themselves after theirs will him me has to other who above because was by will of the do my himself do t them them as as are she a can but should after not it will of his yours why below only
