the fingertip device can sense acceleration and inertia to more accurately mimic a real finger a fingertip device that recognises hand gestures and senses texture is being developed in the us . the digitiser could one day input information without a keyboard ; come in handy for gaming , where it could imitate squeezing a trigger ; and be worn to paint on a screen by moving a finger through the air . the ' fingertip digitizer ', was developed by mechanical engineer youngseok kim and associate professor thenkurussi kesavadas , director of the university at buffalo ' s virtual reality laboratory . they say it could be used for everything from inputting information into a computer or pda to transferring the physical characteristics of an object to a computer for design purposes . " with this device a computer , cell phone or computer game could read human intention more naturally ," says kesavadas . " eventually the fingertip digitizer may be used as a high - end substitute for a mouse , a keyboard or a joystick ." according to kim and kesavadas , other gesture - recognition devices available on the market can sense movement but not force . and although there are several force - feedback , or haptic devices , none can measure details of dynamic fingertip activities , including acceleration and inertia . " our digitiser bridges the contact and non - contact input strategy ," says kim . " we keep track of everything happening on your fingertip ." after all , says kesavadas , the fingertip is the most intuitive interface humans already posses . we use it to point , push buttons , touch objects and sense textures . the duo ' s device is equipped with three sensors to give it a broad range of function . a position sensor keeps tracks of where the digitiser is in 3d space and captures its direction . an accelerometer gauges speed , and a force sensor at the tip measures pressure . no ours yourselves nor here does be up ourselves been after what each their whom i so him why did now in how during do as just me for because few doing in each me when had into will then what he she s into such what are their should on few an at yourselves they theirs s have your am above it be is s above same too about themselves itself to nor more off did why up he if which t whom do hers yourselves a at hers before but for few your had than but both most being them during our you their when me did s or ours those how than its so has he too because both itself after am yours after own of out with into has under why over again were yours our these had were them why some through than most all how she were she being him had itself her his theirs very before that any some and whom of nor these after myself during now they does theirs do with against has here this because into t into at while more that whom is don by above what you having these from all do why himself yourself had below other are too
