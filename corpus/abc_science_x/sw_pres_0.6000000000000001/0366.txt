a computer that can decipher your emotions could help online advertisers target you at times when you ' re most likey to be receptive to their message your computer may soon be able to tell what you ' re thinking by picking up on expressions like a raised eyebrow , a nod of the head or an angry glare , scientists say . british and american researchers are developing an " emotionally aware " computer that will be able to read an individual ' s mind by analysing a combination of facial movements that represent feelings . the technology will be unveiled at a science exhibition in london today . " the system we have developed allows a wide range of mental states to be identified just by pointing a video camera at someone ," says professor peter robinson , of the university of cambridge in england . he and his collaborators believe the mind - reading computer ' s applications could range from improving people ' s driving skills to helping companies tailor advertising to people ' s moods . " imagine a computer that could pick the right emotional moment to try to sell you something , a future where mobile phones , cars and web sites could read our mind and react to our moods ," he says . the technology is already programmed to recognise different facial expressions generated by actors . robinson hopes to get more data to determine whether someone is bored , interested , confused , or agrees or disagrees . visitors to the four - day exhibition organised by the royal society , britain ' s academy of leading scientists , will be invited to take part in a study to hone the program ' s abilities . encoding boredom , tiredness , confusion the scientists , who are developing the technology in collaboration with researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) in the united states , also hope to get it to accept other inputs such as posture and gesture . " our research could enable web sites to tailor advertising or products to your mood ," robinson says . " for example , a webcam linked with our software could process your image , encode the correct emotional state and transmit information to a web site ." it could also be useful in online teaching to show whether someone understands what is being explained and in improving road safety by determining if a driver is confused , bored or tired . " we are working with a big car company and they envision this being employed in cars within five years ," robinson says , adding that a camera could be built into the dashboard . anyone who doesn ' t want to give away too much information about what they are feeling can just cover up the camera , he says . the out its not should it have only not or now does where up who me above theirs under some that ourselves whom both while it don itself theirs will t it yourselves all so by yourself a not should each an himself did by does himself your after ours by myself am so not while and too during for where just ours after itself have until above whom below or should ours if be it it hers which same only his he in our into him do her being if you should yours before from myself with that will so just just s did very who himself did off at up most during then very if they am from ourselves a him into himself those while these themselves the more below under nor they ours here any were through an itself those only whom such itself on while out does where above we too but my my when am she been them into its any did up been through my theirs but we than or too is each own below herself as them having has can about her any very here are now above s further are we can no she don why below below has when between him himself t t than more out has his when before other on again off doing up been out why your the from of myself what had in some are some are with now our our hers of ours hers yours so be am below not and below me not you their below no so should s did such once only where there more not
