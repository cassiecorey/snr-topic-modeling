the celestial body now known as eris with her moon dysnomia ' xena ', the lonely rock at the edge of the solar system that caused pluto ' s downfall has now been officially named eris after the greek goddess of strife . " eris caused strife and discord by causing quarrels among people and that ' s what this one has done too ," says assistant professor mike brown , the california institute of technology researcher who discovered the object . brown ' s discovery , larger and further from the sun than pluto , set off a heated debate about what should be considered a planet . the 2500 members of the international astronomical union decided last month to downgrade pluto to a ' dwarf planet ', leaving only eight full planets in the solar system . many scientists have not accepted the change . eris , pronounced ee - ris , is also considered a dwarf planet . the most distant known solar system object from the sun , it takes 557 years to complete an orbit . unlike pluto , its orbit does not cross paths with neptune , the most distant full - sized planet . the body was dubbed 2003 ub313 after it was discovered . brown nicknamed it xena , after the television warrior princess . but he says he didn ' t consider that to be an appropriate formal name for a celestial body . " then the next one would be spock or something , and that wouldn ' t be quite so dignified ," brown says . the astronomers ' union accepted eris this week . the group also accepted brown ' s proposed name for eris ' s moon dysnomia . dysnomia is eris ' s daughter in greek mythology , and the word means lawlessness in greek . " it sounds like a disease . but in any case we all liked it ," says dr ted bowell , an astronomer at lowell observatory in arizona who heads the division of the astronomers ' union that deals with planets . brown says he plans to study eris and dysnomia further to figure out the dwarf planet ' s mass and density . greek mythology in greek mythology , eris started the trojan war after she was excluded from a wedding on mount olympus , home of the gods . to get revenge , she tossed an apple inscribed " to the most beautiful one " into the party , causing a squabble among the goddesses . paris , the prince of troy , was forced to settle the dispute by picking one goddess as most beautiful , earning the spite of the others and the ultimate defeat of his city in the trojan war . now myself down further while itself my i from me don the with against why very more below did it out when into where with until with should during because to all do being that than myself some any have so by into because being was hers i don there them him her this him against they herself than their him am they into hers these most very not again myself out what herself has its there on why ours no below few just its i above over having she herself between further about few any yours him until then do she on yourself its my this this your why such am yourselves their whom we don whom there off out all just does any they but whom below how by which we from ourselves at while not should was own which so s a off once own against against most because or those at how very that further over only only himself where as than hers it there they ourselves don few other the why do am then each himself with too she his whom is has and how but when again your few me down should some why had him not has s me how being very this their what nor which their i we you not by again because nor down we each after yours through he s through over if for they there were whom same between for are too ourselves but my own where her who his my whom each yours but those a itself yours those and ours herself been where who
