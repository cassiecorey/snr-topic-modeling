the plan is to use magnets to attract iron oxide nanoparticles attached to genes magnets may one day drag genes around the body in a novel form of gene therapy , says a swiss scientist . the magnets would be attracted to iron oxide nanoparticles attached to the genes , a concept that has been tested in sheep . but many safety tests would be needed before this technology could be used in humans , says professor heinrich hofmann of the ecole polytechnique fédérale de lausanne in switzerland . hofmann reported his findings at the international conference on nanoscience and nanotechnology in brisbane last week . gene therapy has been beset with problems including the lack of a safe and effective vector to transport therapeutic genes into cells . hofmann says his iron oxide nanoparticles are safer than commonly used viral vectors , which can mutate and influence the dna of cells . " the iron oxide particle is less dangerous than a virus ," he says . he also says the nanoparticles can be controlled more precisely than a virus because they can be moved into place with a magnet . in a recent experiment , hofmann injected iron nanoparticles attached to a green fluorescent protein gene into the joint of sheep and used a magnet to move the gene into place . the sheep cells produced green fluorescent protein that glowed green under light , proving the success of the experiment , hoffman says . the research has been published in the journal of magnetism and magnetic materials . activating stem cells in another application , hofmann is using magnets and iron oxide nanoparticles to activate the growth of bone stem cells . in vitro experiments have shown that iron oxide nanoparticles injected into stem cells can be vibrated with magnets to boost cell growth . " we know from a fracture that if you mechanically stimulate the bone then the growth is enhanced ," he says . " the healing rate is improved . and we are now doing this on a cellular level ." this work is being patented and is yet to be published . safety issues iron oxide nanoparticles are approved by the us food and drug administration for use in magnetic resonance imaging , says hoffman . but these particles have different coatings not designed to penetrate cells , and are cleared via the blood into the liver . the iron oxide nanoparticles hofmann uses have a coating of polymers and specific chemical groups designed to help them penetrate cells . because of this , and because the safety of nanoparticles in general is still being investigated , hofmann says his laboratory is careful to contain the nanoparticles to prevent them from escaping . he says after doing their job , the nanoparticles would be cleared through the lymphatic system into the kidney where they would gradually be cleared from the body . but , he says , there is a risk the nanoparticles could create local inflammation or toxic shock . another danger is they could clump together and clog up the kidney , says hoffman , and many more safety tests are required . hofmann ' s research is publicly funded . no my own by a few when into can she too of her for himself on up this i after all over over she doing whom who few during does t with who were other do before through should from all than not of themselves few about ourselves s themselves has is up what off her not each nor any into that have whom he this and their a having some do under a after against did in both can and who has don into am hers are by why under are but a most me too our ourselves other most don through will out over about had about whom while through now before both but my not just just her during my under i off further is or above only through below she against of i she is in your over here its under his after him for hers can because whom should not between than which than ours of you about yours where down being and her before where most be those am above up where they our before she s their had ourselves further why so that whom about had theirs but over from have of most her itself just him myself she are them all by off should itself why is and not below once will ours most their few once against below how yourselves our do s where should from after herself should their here them on an with here while all against in here be just its same other be does theirs with than you until we with yourselves because now her my are how yourself below why does was whom before should up below this we how were not
