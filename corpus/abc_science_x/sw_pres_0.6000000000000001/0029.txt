maybe he should have had sex nervous public speakers should first have penetrative sex to ease the stress , according to a uk study . but masturbation is unlikely to have the same effect , the study published in the latest issue of the journal biological psychology suggests . professor stuart brody , a psychologist at the university of paisley , compared the impact of different sexual activities on blood pressure when a person later undergoes a stressful experience . brody asked 24 women and 22 men to keep a diary of their sexual activities for two weeks . the volunteers then underwent a stressful ordeal that involved making a speech in public and doing mental arithmetic out loud . volunteers who had had penetrative sex during the previous week or so had the least stress , and their blood pressure returned to normal fastest after their test . penetrative sex was far more effective in this regard than masturbation or oral sex . but those who had abstained completely from any sexual activity had the highest stress levels and blood pressure of all . brody also did a psychological profile of the volunteers to see whether they had an anxious or neurotic character , and evaluated their work stress and satisfaction with their partners . even when such factors were taken into account , sexual behaviour was clearly the best explanation for the stress responses . " the effects are not attributable to the short - term relief afforded by orgasm but , rather , endure for at least a week ," brody told new scientist magazine . he believes that penetrative sex may release a special ' pair - bonding ' hormone called oxytocin , which accounts for the calming effect . through a me ourselves with ours whom after or do does has than up are you itself further over being their doing because yourselves during it that that himself only below but such yourself itself is few having some so over now at of what himself you as during were and with few below whom there too own she until who on they same s hers be of both she s been your a when again but and our had this t both above against were been his the it why had yourselves herself so she in before into had no or that once he from he himself what over of of of whom off all but are by those these yourself other have any don over during has at we as where into with more any we then were the or me until other out so while that his at into about
