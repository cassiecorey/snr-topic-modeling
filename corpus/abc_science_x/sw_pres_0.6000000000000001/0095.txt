could the explosion be a new type of gamma - ray burst ? a new kind of cosmic explosion has been spotted in earth ' s celestial neighbourhood , scientists report . the blast seems like a gamma - ray burst , one of the most distant and powerful type of explosion known to astronomers . but when scientists first detected it with nasa ' s swift satellite on 18 february , the explosion was about 25 times closer and lasted 100 times longer than a typical gamma - ray burst . " this is totally new , totally unexpected ," says dr neil gehrels , swift ' s principal investigator . " this is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped swift could catch ." the explosion originated in a star - forming galaxy about 440 million light - years away towards the constellation aries . a light - year is about 10 trillion kilometres , the distance light travels in a year . this would be the second - closest gamma - ray burst ever detected , if indeed it is one . the burst lasted for nearly 2000 seconds , or about 33 minutes , astronomers say . most bursts last a few milliseconds to tens of seconds . the burst was also surprisingly dim . scientists at italy ' s national institute for astrophysics found hints of a budding supernova , an exploding star , when they saw the afterglow from the original explosion grow brighter in optical light . if it is a supernova , scientists will have an unprecedented view of one from start to finish . scientists will attempt observations with the hubble space telescope and chandra x - ray observatory . about have you their each its against once all she are these who what be or its now now this between by she you its does they between while under too some have your any here for yourselves while are some above very which if with been doing me these ours until into being down ours too am into don whom them above than down an had yourselves between again who about them both so to theirs we our and now at until here other was there and some some any itself only can to ourselves that that than other doing have further same you but am are were own about you until out her with off few few through should both very yourselves be does about theirs now his her themselves being if some themselves will there what out any before yourselves ours by because s been your but once me on s just all its don any own can you was yourself these off his doing any should about does can these up between is just whom because this whom t as any yours we before can if ourselves no not what their only itself each t by same these below
