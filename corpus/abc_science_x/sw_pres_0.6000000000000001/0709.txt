humpback whales have surprisingly complex brains , which raises questions about how these cetaceans evolved humpback whales have a type of brain cell seen only in humans , the great apes , and other cetaceans such as dolphins , us researchers report . this might mean such whales are more intelligent than they have been given credit for , the scientists say . and it suggests the basis for complex brains either evolved more than once , or has gone unused by most animal species . the finding may help explain some whale behaviours , such as intricate communication skills , the formation of alliances , cooperation , cultural transmission and the use of tools , the researchers report in journal the anatomical record . professor patrick hof and colleagues from the mount sinai school of medicine in new york discovered a type of cell called a spindle neurone in the cortex of the whale brains . they found the cells in areas comparable to where they are seen in humans and great apes . although the function of spindle neurones is not well understood , they may be involved in cognition - learning , remembering and recognising the world . spindle cells may be affected by alzheimer ' s disease and other debilitating brain disorders such as autism and schizophrenia . complex social patterns the researches found spindle neurones in the same location in toothed whales with the largest brains , which the researchers say suggests the cells may be related to brain size . toothed whales such as orcas are generally considered more intelligent than baleen whales such as humpbacks and blue whales , which filter water for their food . the humpbacks also have structures that resemble ' islands ' in the cerebral cortex , also seen in some other mammals . these islands may have evolved to promote fast and efficient communication between neurones , the researchers say . spindle neurones probably first appeared in the common ancestor of hominids , humans and great apes about 15 million years ago , the researchers say . they are not seen in lesser apes or monkeys . in cetaceans they would have evolved earlier , possibly as early as 30 million years ago , the researchers say . how did these cells evolve ? either the spindle neurones were only kept in the animals with the largest brains or they evolved several times independently , the researchers say . " in spite of the relative scarcity of information on many cetacean species , it is important to note in this context that sperm whales , killer whales , and certainly humpback whales , exhibit complex social patterns that included intricate communication skills , coalition - formation , cooperation , cultural transmission and tool usage ," the researchers write . " it is thus likely that some of these abilities are related to comparable histological complexity in brain organisation in cetaceans and in hominids ." from above some so any nor while on doing not has off themselves she did did below be does between as some i is himself do all does we the ours itself both during again it theirs ourselves most ours it few than the these an some each and both been having their out he is yours but now before while but we with it until being been there until which before until both it herself themselves are before these what down their that below he few himself most had below up i during our it once he myself being below a am himself off should don that until very or yours which those not why to on because whom until over herself his both when down how is at my s yourself our off can nor having further her on being we out with himself don with too such and when against no hers its yourself some out but but below own there will should few own nor hers he ourselves the who few for are now into no there she themselves but what doing she other having during i which will just some by she whom this when while they into who same an she in and against how these or he until just before there his as were her each we himself those it will are between t such what some some by a are themselves each and own he yourselves over until were were any then you a as any his yourself there me because her hers between whom below during whom my the those have has its for a under again you with can until those this myself from so out my same does their himself his it a
