how much old research is based on fraud ? details are emerging about the latest case , which involves papers in three medical journals a norwegian mouth cancer specialist has admitted to fabricating research data published in several international scientific magazines , in the latest fraud case to rock the medical research world . a doctor at the institute for cancer research at the norwegian radium hospital , dr jon sudb & oslash ;, has confessed to forging data used to document research published last october in the lancet as well as in two other articles . the revelation comes on the heels of the disclosure that south korea ' s celebrated cloning pioneer professor hwang woo - suk had faked research papers claiming breakthroughs in stem cell research . suspicion that sudb & oslash ;, 44 , had forged data in the lancet article surfaced earlier this month and several investigations have been launched into his conduct . " he has indicated that in addition to the article in the lancet , two of his other articles contained information in which the conclusions have no basis ," says sudb & oslash ;' s lawyer erling lyngtveit . the two other articles appeared in the new england journal of medicine in april 2004 and the journal of clinical oncology in march 2005 . " it appears that he started cheating a little bit , and then the deception got completely out of control in his last article in the lancet ," the lawyer adds . made - up study in the lancet article , the doctor maintained that anti - inflammatory drugs like aspirin were efficient in preventing mouth cancer , but they also increased the risk of cardiovascular disease . he based this conclusion on data from 908 fictitious patients , 205 of whom had been given the same date of birth . " this had nothing to do with money ," lyngtveit insists . " in different circumstances , his motives would be perceived as positive since they are what helps research to move forward : the desire to contribute to something , the yearning for fame and glory ," he says , adding however that " this got completely out of hand ". in sudb & oslash ;' s article in the new england journal of medicine , he claimed that the resection of the first cancerous cells in the oral cavity did not have an impact on the mortality rate in patients . according to his lawyer , he now admits he did not have the mortality statistics to back up that claim . sudb & oslash ;' s article in the journal of clinical oncology meanwhile discussed the possibility of calculating which heavy smokers would contract mouth cancer . he has now admitted that he had only taken blood tests from some of the patients , and not all of them as previously claimed , to check if they had continued smoking , lyngtveit says . over the past decade , sudb & oslash ; has published 38 articles in international scientific magazines , but his lawyer insists that " the forgery only occurred in three articles ". " sudb & oslash ; acted alone . his co - authors contributed to the articles in good faith ," he adds . the case has contributed to further weakening faith in research published in scientific reviews after the widely publicised hwang scandal . in 2005 hwang claimed to have derived 11 stem cell lines tailored to specific patients , which are believed to have the potential to reduce the risk of rejection of new organs . in 2004 , he said he had derived a stem cell from a human embryo . but after a month - long probe , a panel of experts from seoul national university found that hwang had created no stem cells of any kind and that his research data was fabricated . us research journal science retracted hwang ' s papers last week . the lancet meanwhile stated on its website earlier this week that " pending clarification , we now issue an expression of concern about the article by sudb & oslash ;". s once all when theirs but do during there now below were his you with while should t
