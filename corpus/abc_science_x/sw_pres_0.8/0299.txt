the new research supports the idea that there ' s more to heredity than dna genetic instructions can be carried from one generation to the next in rna , a mouse experiment by french researchers suggests . dr minoo rassoulzadegan , of the university of nice sophia antipolis , and team report their findings in today ' s issue of the journal nature . " this is the first demonstration of rna - induced transmission of heredity ," rassoulzadegan says . rna , or ribonucleic acid , is a single - strand molecule that plays a key role in making proteins in animals by transferring and translating genetic information encoded in dna . but rassoulzadegan and team have now found that it is capable of much more . spotty mutant mice surprise scientists they engineered laboratory mice to have a variation in a gene called kit . the variation gave the mice white spots on their tails . the mice concerned had a mutant version and a normal version in the two copies of their kit gene . the researchers crossed these heterozygous mice and examined the offspring . some of the offspring had both copies of the normal kit genes , yet , remarkably , they also had the white spots . the researchers also found that the white spots were transmitted to the next generation of mice , even though these rodents also had the normal genes . a challenge to mendel ' s laws the findings challenge the laws of inheritance , set down in the 19th century by austrian monk gregor mendel . according to these , offspring can only get the genetic code exactly as it is handed on from their parents . by all rights , if the mice both had normal kit genes , their tails should have been reassuringly spotless . rassoulzadegan suggests the answer to this mystery lies in rna . the mutant version of kit produces unexpectedly large numbers of aberrantly - sized " messenger " rna , she found . in addition , the sperm of mutant mice also , surprisingly , was found to have accumulations of rna . intrigued by this , her team injected rna from mutant cells into normal embryos and , presto , spotted - tail mice were born . rna carried in sperm acts as gene silencer the hypothesis is that rna is carried in the mouse ' s sperm , and at fertilisation it " silences " the activity of the normal kit gene . this happens not only in the offspring but in subsequent generations too . back in 1956 , an american biologist called r . alexander brink became the first to suggest " paramutation ", in which an order issued by one set of genes was remembered in ensuing generations , even though the gene itself was not subsequently handed on in reproduction . but the phenomenon has only been seen in lab plants , not in mammals . in addition , it occurs only very rarely , apparently as a result of interaction between the two copies of a gene . normally , the pair of genes operate independently . caution urged before rewriting rule book in a commentary on rassoulzadegan ' s research , also carried in nature , dr paul soloway of cornell university , new york , stresses caution , saying that her findings have to be replicated by others before mendel ' s rule book has to be rewritten . and , he says , the mechanism by which the transmitted rna works remains unclear . but if the work is validated , the way is open for a rethink on how rna could influence the transmision of heredity diseases , metabolism and even types of " imprinted " behaviour from distant generations . ourselves who most theirs at been other its my once through have over
