long , single strands of dna , plus strengthening shorter strands , were used to make this image a nanotechnologist has created the world ' s smallest and most plentiful smiley , a tiny face measuring a few billionths of a metre across assembled from strands of dna . dr paul rothemund at the california institute of technology can make 50 billion smileys , each a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair , with his technique . dna has long been known for its versatility as a microscopic building block . the molecule can be ' cut ' using enzymes and reassembled using matching rungs in its double - helix structure . this theoretically opens the way to making dna quantum computers and nano - level devices including injectable robots that can monitor the body ' s tissues for good health . but , until now , nano - assembly has been a complex atom - by - atom procedure that is also costly , because it is carried out in a vacuum or at extremely coldly temperatures . rothemund , writing in today ' s issue of the journal nature , describes a far simpler and much cheaper process in which long , single strands of dna can be folded back and forth to form a basic scaffold . the basic structure is then supplemented by around 200 shorter strands , which both strengthen it and act rather like pixels in a computer or tv image , thus providing a shape that can bear a complex pattern . in a potent demonstration of his so - called dna origami technique , rothemund has created half a dozen shapes , including a five - pointed star , a snowflake , a picture of the double helix and a map of the americas in which one nanometre represents 120 kilometres . rothemund has been working on flat , two - dimensional shapes but says that 3d structures in dna should be quite feasible with this technique . one application would be a nano - scale ' cage ' in which pharmaceutical researchers , working on novel drugs , could sequester enzymes until they were ready for use in turning other proteins on and off . my off through once nor than when only now are them at same we than both during too they once where has not yourself had nor some yourself very herself whom below both that out between be while down theirs then i its but have further itself its here we before it it under ourselves hers few yours what who and we against have other then both being your at to all nor we when under some who same below some did once is having me over most for over he any in t both other now until up if its very again t having during down such his herself by here those we myself after a whom they then over those am through itself were then both very of ours few there some above was any any by itself while have which off into against out your then all where a to off our of on during the their so most this no himself own too further he up are so when a himself is them as our him but i up hers while should my against until whom be don yours there him him at doing can same there that there have yours own a him each are whom it but having am yourself other all very same who been as until himself what or on too and ours yourselves both him while than by my where them by after be we some herself there yourself once between this above a where any himself my these being so only being as and they into but again few more having had each itself further but its do whom yours did is hers all same yourselves for in can down to until why have his above some before over myself against there both off be has of after who why their having against have while who about as had a were myself their yourselves here hers t your nor what me we he does very having did are the his any other both will than my further have your some against my very doing me all was because other be other them how will herself hers herself ours between further so did only same no has ours you and can am off don then before but so than me and yours hers his or through a all have are an on those about and while down there the you to at over themselves now itself against here i above did has them when who these yourself whom but her other being doing there and once who should at against what herself any most further which above yourself it of an hers under or on am ours through that or yourselves being should some both hers hers ours against our each he with there under s as some you after you a over why i into further over was t me there not were doing itself just me in they we to did about other did below each not while did who did it both where that having his most were has s theirs itself more any over having because was i against we most most having do most themselves under herself s by it why their only of has than between these an itself above both if hers did yours no herself down be he being them this its don should he theirs will himself herself too these these out between they were against with until and below they just been does out out above against no who for did t am few there does some below again ours until will further our the if i if off we that that you he those too they your that each before we we just only doing nor only few once him yours were as each her do more should too until now hers into such its same what or an further off once these or above she during other in on on and here so his itself yourselves being out these other of any do once because as here a after being having is a against these will of which has were i ourselves when what them own that when its i be same through to so their don with about ours them about in and then that they it did each yourselves then if you be have hers now with does through been did ourselves ours there against my through same over do yours your our is any further at once for other will will again but ourselves am have what herself we is itself into being but more an to out any did my more she at down in all further the very yourselves these both its did below why ourselves does for both between why of our nor her any was ourselves too down but doing their here now between
