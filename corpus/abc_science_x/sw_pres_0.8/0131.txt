the rainbow serpent , a key aboriginal dreamtime creation symbol , is closely connected with indigenous knowledge of groundwater systems indigenous australians dug underground water reservoirs that helped them live on one of the world ' s driest continents for tens of thousands of years , new research shows . the study , which is the first of its kind , indicates aboriginal people had extensive knowledge of the groundwater system , says hydrogeologist brad moggridge , knowledge that is still held today . some 70 % of the continent is covered by desert or semi - arid land , which meant its original inhabitants needed to know how to find and manage this resource if they were to survive . " aboriginal people survived on one of the driest continents for thousands and thousands of years ," says brad moggridge , who is from kamilaroi country in northern new south wales . " without water you die . they managed that water sustainably ." moggridge , currently a principal policy officer in the new south wales department of environment and conservation , did his research as part of a masters degree at the university of technology , sydney . he based his work on oral histories , dreamtime stories , rock art , artefacts and ceremonial body painting as well as written accounts by white missionaries , surveyors , settlers , anthropologists and explorers . managing scant resources moggridge says indigenous australians channelled and filtered their water , covering it to avoid contamination and evaporation . they also created wells and tunnel reservoirs . " groundwater was accessed through natural springs or people used to dig tunnels to access it ," he says . " sometimes they ' d dig till they found the water and then they ' d build a system so they could access the water . sometimes they ' ve go fairly deep and people would slither down there and get their water ." aboriginal people also used terrain , birdlife , vegetation and animals as markers for water , moggridge says . for example , they followed dingos to rock pools and waterholes while ants led them to subterranean reservoirs . " they used the landscape ," he says . " for example , you ' re in a dry area and all of a sudden there ' s a large number of ghost gums , so you ' d think there must be some groundwater ." the dreamtime aboriginal people ' s understanding of their groundwater system permeates dreamtime stories , moggridge says . for example , the rainbow serpent is a key symbol of creation but its journey from underground to the surface also represents groundwater rising to the top via springs . moggridge says european settlers owed their subsequent knowledge of groundwater to local tribes and trackers , and even much of australia ' s modern road system is based on water sources identified by the original inhabitants . " a lot of the old roads in new south wales are based on aboriginal walking tracks ... and their water supply would have been along the way ," he says . the desert knowledge crc is also trying to link traditional knowledge with science in terms of water management in central australia , home to numerous remote indigenous communities . current projects include looking at the cultural values of water
