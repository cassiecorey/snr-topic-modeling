will the venus express mission yield new insights into what awaits earth ? a space probe that arrives at venus today will yield new insights into what caused the runaway greenhouse effect there and could bring a salutary warning for our own planet , scientists say . the european space agency ' s venus express will spend three years peering through a shroud of toxic sulfur clouds to glean information about the climate , atmosphere and curious ' backwards ' rotation of the so - called pressure cooker planet . it ' s also hoped the mission will help answer questions about what caused its mysterious ' resurfacing ' some 500 million years ago and whether it is being shaken by seismic activity and volcanoes . it may also provide clues about whether the earth and venus were once similar , and when and why they took such radically different paths , says dr frank mills of the australian national university , an expert in the chemistry of the venusian atmosphere who has been working with scientists directly involved in the mission . " there are many uncertainties in trying to reconstruct venus ' evolution ," he says . " some of these may be resolvable by making appropriate observations ." the greenhouse effect the uk ' s royal astronomical society says " any astronaut unlucky enough to land [ on venus ] would be simultaneously crushed , roasted , choked and dissolved ". venus ' atmosphere is 90 times denser than earth ' s and 96 % is made up of the greenhouse gas co2 . scientists say this causes a strong warming effect and heats the surface of the planet to around 500 & deg ; c . there are no signs of water on venus and its surface is apparently more arid that the driest desert on earth . associate director of the australian centre for astrobiology at macquarie university dr jeremy bailey says isotope ratios in the atmosphere suggest that venus once had oceans that have since evaporated . dr john lattanzio , from australia ' s centre for stellar and planetary astrophysics at monash university , says that unlike earth , venus lacks a co2 cycle . on earth , this cycle means the co2 gets locked into water and rock and comes back out through volcanic activity , he says . " so at any given time [ on earth ] there ' s a lot of co2 that ' s out of the atmosphere ... and it self - regulates ," he says . " venus doesn ' t have a co2 cycle because there aren ' t any oceans ." mills says the probe may also help explain whether the co2 on venus is produced by a catalytic reaction . he says the probe will also shed more light on the general processes by which atmospheric " greenhouses " work . " venus ' atmospheric greenhouse has both similarities to and differences from earth ' s ," he says , and data from this mission will allow scientists to compare the two . a mirror to our own future ? bailey says learning more about venus will help us understand where our own planet is headed . but he doesn ' t believe " anything like venus will result from the amount of co2 we ' re currently putting into the atmosphere ". rather , the earth may end up like venus over billions of years because of the increasing brightness of the sun . " in about a million years it will have increased by about 10 % and it ' s estimated that will be enough to trigger the sorts of changes that have happened in venus ," he says . mills says that venus teaches us not to take for granted that the climate on earth will always be benign and support life . " research on how venus may have evolved , what its carbon cycle is like and how volcanic activity may influence climate helps in understanding what is possible for a planet ," he says . nasa ' s deep space network , including the canberra deep space communication complex , has been tracking venus express . venus express is due to end its 400 million kilometre , five month journey around 5 . 30 pm
