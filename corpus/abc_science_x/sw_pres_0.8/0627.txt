brain damage can improve your artistic skills but can also make your paintings less ' emotional '. so does everyone have the potential to become the next picasso ? damage to a particular part of the brain can trigger artistic talent , us neurologists show . when they looked at one particular artist whose frontal and temporal lobes of the brain had deteriorated , they found she had developed new artistic skills . the us researchers published their study into the artistic effects of frontotemporal lobar dementia in the latest issue of the journal neurology . there have been reports of previously inartistic people becoming talented visual artists after developing this condition . but it is not clear whether the brain atrophy is releasing dormant talent , or the disease itself has somehow triggered the artistic expression . to investigate , dr valeria drago of the university of florida at gainesville and others studied the art of a woman who had been an artist before developing this type of brain damage . as the woman ' s condition worsened , they found , her artistic technique improved , but the emotional power of her work decreased . " we can really follow how the paintings have been changed following the disease ," says drago . drago and her team gathered 40 of the woman ' s paintings , including several from the period before she developed symptoms . some were when her symptoms were beginning , and some were painted later . the researchers then gave 18 men and women training on how to evaluate six different artistic qualities , and asked them to rate the paintings . ratings for the paintings ' artistic skill rose as the woman ' s disease progressed . but ratings on the paintings ' ' evocative impact ' and ' closure ' fell . evocative impact is the ability of a work of art to elicit an emotional reaction , while closure is the sense that a painting is finished and complete . drago and her team note that the condition leaves the parts of the brain at work in drawing , painting and other skills relatively intact . the part of the brain the disease does affect may typically inhibit this region of the brain , so when it is damaged artistic talents have freer rein , they suggest . the researchers also point out that patients with this form of brain damage may have damage to the limbic system , a network within the brain essential for mediating emotions . this damage could in turn impair an artist ' s ability to paint emotionally affecting paintings , or to portray emotion visually . drago says she and her team are continuing to study creativity and the brain , and are currently looking at how normal ageing may change creativity . of those from own our off off when after now do no is
