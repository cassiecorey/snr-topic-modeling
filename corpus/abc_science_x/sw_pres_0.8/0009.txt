why did the turtle cross the road ? because it wanted lunch scientists are studying the wandering ways of australia ' s eastern long - necked turtle to see if can learn to cross the road . professor arthur georges , director of the applied ecology research group at the university of canberra , says it ' s the first time researchers have documented how roads affect the turtles . georges says unlike other turtles , chelodina longicollis has evolved the ability to take long overland hikes because it prefers ephemeral waters , such as temporary swamps and pools . " when a wetland dries , the nutrients are released from the sediment and when it refills there ' s a flush of production , so they ' re capitalising on all the insects and other foods that benefit from that flush ," he says . the hardy creatures gravitate to permanent waters in a drought , where they can ' switch off ' growth and reproduction , sometimes for as long as seven years . they then hit the road as soon as the rains come . georges and his team are studying a population of turtles in jervis bay in southern new south wales and hope to have some results ready for publication in the middle of the year . look right , look left , look right again georges says the long - necked turtle is familiar with its environment and may even have learnt to avoid roads . " what we have found is that they ... use the sun and an internal clock to navigate and they know landscape really well so they tend to beeline to various places ," he says . " we ' re going to take them from the wetlands and release them near a road and observe their behaviour as they approach the road . they may have an aversion to [ it ] and turn around ." but if the road safety message hasn ' t sunk in it may be necessary to build tunnels under roads to provide them with safe passage , he says . while it appears that some aspects of development have got in the way of the turtle ' s natural behaviour , it hasn ' t been all bad for the long - necked turtle , georges says . " when you fly over [ surrounding farmland ] you ' ll see there are lots of dams ," he says . " each one is full of about 20 - 30 turtles , and those sorts of water bodies weren ' t there before ," he says . " but on the downside , when a road runs through a wetland you can increase the chance that over time the population will decline ." own ourselves hers off should about will myself same when when very for below doing itself were he for now below yours i most those whom should with more after if but will while because themselves so me with very is now from an again to below any that only up being than out had few themselves myself some once before his she if if had she should then why her their about can whom below do doing more own nor in until having themselves above same did will it once most has only any being where such himself after the yourselves their s don because has through than not their s now at but any other same were each again both so be of been does about this nor they below at then hers does there too before has t after such that as not those now been once again yourselves s were during be which through here until be doing t of don few of him be very be same same are the most some them have its this own before so and while which and where had in through should me over have during any until yourselves very do being until at doing any for further yours itself and her there theirs how does against up such when theirs an such and from before here do theirs at how myself any did all than of below any hers my his very own where between does a has who in on each once him should over an with too why only most am both have whom once when i did or hers they below while not how it it other be is into hers for itself my further while having if we as himself during more to that down before to does can be did this when to most it some such if your are these any those an he them with during being for but off can such there who once nor its most my between what does if now few are had while then as it as nor when up they being herself once no had until out ourselves into yourselves but on were against can yours all their more while under theirs which those is any into which his after both been if did above for off over into which as all then such in who were she by the yours don me no over on too will don what down he nor your be during hers what whom nor before they they further before herself t was too she yourselves does ourselves no so him him until she above no being yourselves all if him out these whom before then were what with yours herself more up be who for where again them or than will for to she their how off by yourselves in their or we does we t his by don its her he such an do this itself few had same itself doing whom only have no under s because he under what what up then your which out and own can into he herself my just yourself above no but it was while or are very but as nor than he were during more them it when above each while hers each again further which herself when have myself himself theirs but on as was more because myself to over few again until was yourself why each his under any them such we where itself why of each ours some was at yourselves over each him down i own his i being at ourselves few himself ours about during more nor further should yourself once by have myself him by be both from now yourselves into for am and what most was am own once the such don any above these these what had will she no about just own nor no through to few by some each me most should with above whom very have his with your few so herself why where any at when where your than been is whom all t did he your up while from whom into into me not such very who more there in now have he having with these other most all out nor and below himself why other she have of if few that once my how that ourselves both and very do your to for am have more myself over an of each him is yourself i did on which he while too about both other just down when she it just this same which during while have with than themselves ours itself they against at when him that out been my them same when theirs have from each your at above below too has themselves from what over are some until here above there him in where its during me if on too t its she an out they against did ours both out only each don that herself same having under we the between can as during a t had nor been its myself any too over against below a her your theirs so not but through whom when me whom am some our other being did doing few ours the down myself or an once a off that my
