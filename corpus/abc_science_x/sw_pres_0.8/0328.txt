australian soccer fans might not be disappointed , according to statistical analysis of the socceroos ' chances in the world cup australia has roughly the same chance of winning the world cup as you have tossing three sixes with three dice , says a sports statistician . professor stephen clarke , a researcher at swinburne university says australia has a 180 to one , or 0 . 6 %, chance of winning the final . " this is not bad and nowhere near as small as the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack or winning [ the lottery ]," he says . " it ' s slightly more than flipping eight heads in a row ( 1 in 256 ) or tossing three sixes with three dice ( 1 in 216 )." while australia goes into the world cup as an underdog , clarke says , statistically speaking , the nature of soccer gives the weaker side a chance . he says , if one team is expected to kick two goals in a match and another is expected to only kick one , the stronger side still only has a 61 % chance of winning , with a 21 % chance of a draw . the weaker team has an 18 % chance of winning . function of rare events " soccer is very variable ," he says . " in australian rules football , suppose one team kicks on average a goal every 10 minutes and the other team kicks on average a goal every five minutes . the chances the weaker team will kick more goals than the other team is quite small . " but in soccer it doesn ' t work that way because goals are much rarer , it ' s a function of rare events ," he says . australia has a 32 % chance of making it through to the second round . predictions on various teams ' chances at making various stages of the world cup are posted on the swinburne sports statistics website . they were formulated by andrew patterson , a former honours student turned professional punter and consultant number cruncher . at the latest analysis the figures showed perennial favourite brazil has a 29 % chance of winning , followed by england with a 10 % chance . according to patterson ' s analysis , australia the same chance of winning as the ivory coast , and serbia and montenegro . trinidad and tobago is ranked at the bottom of the ladder with a demoralising 0 % chance of winning the world cup . factoring in public opinion patterson worked out the statistics using odds from an international online betting exchange and ran them through a computer model taking into account the structural peculiarities of the world cup competition and other factors . " i ' ve taken a combination of the public ' s opinion as well as past data and my own statistical expertise to come up with a statistical model that predicts a team ' s chances ," he says . his model will update predicted outcomes as the tournament progresses . patterson says his analysis also puts australia as favourite to win its opener against japan on 12 june . " i put the two sides into the computer and based on how they currently stand ... there ' s a 55 % chance australia will win and a 45 % chance that japan will win ," he says . " when we factor a draw in we come up with 38 % australia , 31 % japan , 31 % the draw . it ' s pretty much a hedged result ." the world cup kicks off on 9 june . from nor below and i against
