stripes on the shoulder of this basketball jersey light up for each foul the player commits an australian researcher has developed a sports jersey that lights up to show players ' goals or fouls , and how much time they have left to play . the jersey is called teamawear and is the brainchild of design computing student mitchell page of the university of sydney . in fast - scoring games like basketball it can be quite hard to keep up - to - date with constantly changing statistics that help you understand what ' s going on , says page . while some information is posted on the scoreboard this can be difficult to look at during the game . page decided that displaying information on players ' jerseys would be a good idea because these are at the centre of the game . " everyone ' s focus is directed towards them ," he says . and the jerseys could display real - time information on individual players that is generally not publicly available . page developed a basketball jersey with displays made out of electroluminescent panels that light up when electricity flow through them . these are connected by conductive thread woven into the jersey . a microcontroller communicates via a wireless connection to a computer at the bench , where someone can input the detailed information as required . there are four stripes over the jersey ' s shoulder that light up as the number of fouls increase and three bars on the side of the jersey each representing 10 goals . two bars on the front of the jersey warn the player when they are nearly out of time . one warns when the game is nearly up and the other warns when they need to shoot without incurring a penalty . and panels on the back , mainly for the benefit of the spectators , light up to show the winning side . page says when players tested the jerseys they found they were comfortable to wear and improved play by giving them immediate access to more information . he says the players found the displays intuitive and easy to understand without being distracting . the warning lights on the front were the most important . if it was a tight game they could pick up pace . but if a player had a lot of fouls , they would have to play conservatively . players might also choose the displays to choose a high - scoring player to pass the ball to . page says the jerseys also had an unexpected effect on players ' psychology . " athletes said they were more confident when they could see that they had high points or they could see that they were winning ," he says . the coach and referee can also use the displays to choose who to keep on the court , without having to refer to the benches and scoreboards as often , says page . page says while slow sports like golf would probably not benefit from his jersey , he hopes the idea can be applied to other team activities . he says it might be useful for emergency service personnel working in noisy , chaotic environments where verbal communication is difficult . teams of people with hearing disabilities , debaters and possibly even orchestra members , might also benefit from the technology , says page . other them very no its further until on as yours ourselves their
