the good news is that beer may prevent prostate cancer . the bad news is that you ' ll destroy your liver if you drink enough to have any effect one of the main ingredients in beer appears to thwart prostate cancer , according to findings released by us researchers . but you would have to quaff more than 17 pints to imbibe a medically effective dose of xanthohumol , the apparently cancer - fighting antioxidant found in hops , says researcher emily ho . " from my studies , you would have to drink an awful lot of beer ," says ho , assistant professor of health and human science at oregon state university . " so the counter effects of the alcohol may outweigh any health benefits from drinking beer ." co - author fred stevens of the university ' s college of pharmacy , says it ' s feasible to make pills containing concentrated doses of xanthohumol or to bump up the level of the chemical in hops . scientists in germany have already brewed up a beer containing ten times as much xanthohumol as found in traditional recipes , stevens says . the brew is being marketed in germany as a healthy beer , but any effect on cancer rates is yet to be shown , he says . beer and pizza richard atkins , head of the us national prostate cancer coalition , says tomato sauce is also believed to be an effective cancer fighter . this means that beer and pizza could be a winning anti - cancer formula . " it ' s every man ' s dream to hear that beer and pizza can prevent cancer ," he says . " bur our hope is that men know the facts and get tested for prostate cancer . food no matter how helpful it may be is not a full preventive for prostate cancer ." while the research regarding xanthohumol is promising , ho cautions that further study is necessary . " the one caveat is that all our work is done in a laboratory system using cultured cells with purified compounds ," she says . now for more good news meanwhile , a separate study has found that drinking coffee may help prevent the liver disease alcoholic cirrhosis . the study of more than 125 , 000 people found that for each cup of coffee they drank per day , participants were 22 & nbsp ;% less likely to develop alcoholic cirrhosis . " these data support the hypothesis that there is an ingredient in coffee that protects against cirrhosis , especially alcoholic cirrhosis ," concludes the report from the kaiser permanente medical care program in oakland . the authors said they could not determine whether it was caffeine or another ingredient in coffee which had the protective effect . the study is published in the american medical association ' s archives of internal medicine . the authors say the findings don ' t suggest heavy drinkers should rely on coffee to prevent alcoholic cirrhosis . " even if coffee is protective , the primary approach to reduction of alcoholic cirrhosis is avoidance or cessation of heavy alcohol drinking ," they say . before then or with s not his being all some
