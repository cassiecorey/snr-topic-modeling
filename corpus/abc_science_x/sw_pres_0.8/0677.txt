seabirds and migratory birds are early responders to changes in climate , according to a new report nearly three quarters of all bird species in northeast australia and more than a third in europe could become extinct unless efforts to stop global warming are stepped up , a report says . up to 72 % of bird species in northeastern australia and 38 % of bird species in europe could disappear completely if the planet ' s temperature continues to rise , according to the international environmental group wwf . " this report finds certain bird groups , such as seabirds and migratory birds , to be early , very sensitive responders to current levels of climate change ," says wwf ' s director of climate change policy hans verolme . " large - scale bird extinctions may occur sooner than we thought ," he says in bird species and climate change : the global status report , released today on the sidelines of the un climate change conference in nairobi . " if high rates of extinction are to be avoided , rapid and significant greenhouse gas emissions cuts must be made ," wwf says . rising sea levels , changes in vegetation and altered temperatures are among the effects of climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions that impact negatively on bird species worldwide , it says . in the great plains of north america , where up to 80 % of the continent ' s ducks come to breed , three quarters may face extinction because of adverse global warming - related changes to their habitat , the report says . while the effects would be most significant if the earth ' s surface temperature rises 2 & deg ; c above its pre - industrial level - it is currently 0 . 8 & deg ; c above - some birds are already feeling the heat . the penguin population of the galapagos islands has decreased by half since the early 1970s , due to starvation and an inability to reproduce resulting from the effects of the el ni & ntilde ; o climate pattern . while migratory , mountain , island , wetland , artic , antarctic and seabirds are all at high risk from climate change , other species that are able to move easily to new habitats will not be as badly effected , it says . scientists also point out that existing conservation programs do not provide sufficient protection , as bird species often shift into unprotected zones , the report says .
