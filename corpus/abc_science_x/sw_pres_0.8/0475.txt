position of the sun at different times of day , as depicted in monet ' s houses of parliament claude monet ' s renditions of foggy london could be the earliest coloured record of the notorious ' pea souper ' smog that wrapped the british capital at the turn of the 20th century , according to a scientific analysis of the artist ' s london series . the study , published in the current issue of the proceedings of the royal society a , show that monet ' s paintings of the house of parliament were not created from his imagination . on the contrary , they were firmly based on actual observations made during the artist ' s visits to london . a founder of impressionism , monet ( 1840 - 1926 ) made three trips to the city between 1899 and 1901 , producing hundreds of paintings . showing the sun struggling to filter through the mist and smoke of victorian london , the paintings depict the most famous global meteorological phenomenon of the 19th and 20th centuries . the paintings show three views of central london engulfed by fog . two southward views are from the savoy hotel , where the french artist had a room , and one westward view is of the house of parliament taken from st thomas ' hospital . among the 95 paintings of the series still existing , only 12 are dated between 1899 and 1901 . a total of 61 are dated between 1902 and 1905 , and 22 are undated . this has suggested that monet dated his works to the time they were completed or sold , when he had already returned from london to his home at giverny in normandy , northern france . " there is some uncertainty as to whether the paintings are reasonably accurate depictions of observations , one of the tenets of impressionism , or whether the final paintings were rather creations of monet ' s imagination in his studio in giverny ," says dr jacob baker , of the university of birmingham . where ' s the sun ? to establish whether monet ' s paintings are a fair rendering of what he observed , baker and his colleague dr john thornes , from the school of geography , earth and environmental sciences , analysed the position of the sun in nine of monet ' s paintings showing the houses of parliament . the researchers turned to astronomical data from the us naval observatory to trace the sun ' s position over parliament during the artist ' s stay in london . they compared this data to the position of the sun in the paintings . along with information in monet ' s letters to his wife , the results revealed that monet painted his parliament pictures all in the afternoon , between 14 february and 24 march 1900 . further calculations made it possible to discover the exact spot from which the french artist painted the pictures : a second floor covered terrace of the former governor ' s hall at st thomas ' hospital . " we are confident that these paintings show an accurate visual record of the urban atmosphere of victorian london ," thornes says . great fog london ' s ' great fogs ' reached a peak in the late 1880s , then gradually declined . but little is known about the nature and causes of the phenomenon , due to the absence of air quality monitoring at the time . " the victorian fogs tended to be associated with industry , employment and wealth to the minds of londoners at that time . air quality and health - related issues tended to be neglected ," baker says . baker and thornes are now planning further detective work on monet ' s colours to determine the size , density and composition of victorian fog particles . while s that hers and before yours t few
