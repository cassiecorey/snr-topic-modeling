king tutenkhamen ' s penis was there all along , scientists say . it wasn ' t stolen and sold , as rumours suggested king tutankhamen ' s rediscovered penis could make the pharaoh stand out in the shrunken world of male mummies , scientists say . they ' ve taken a close look at old pictures of the 3300 - year - old mummified king . his sexual organ has been just another puzzle in the story of the best - known pharaoh of ancient egypt . harry burton ( 1879 - 1940 ) photographed the royal penis intact during howard carter ' s excavation of king tut ' s tomb in 1922 . but it was reported missing in 1968 , when uk scientist professor ronald harrison took a series of x - rays of the mummy . there was speculation that the penis had been stolen and sold . " instead , it has always been there . i found it during the ct scan last year , when the mummy was lifted . it lay loose in the sand around the king ' s body . it was mummified ," says professor zahi hawass , chief of egypt ' s supreme council of antiquities . at first look , burton ' s pictures may seem to indicate that king tut could have been a little better endowed . but according to mummy expert dr eduard egarter vigl , the pharaoh was built normally . egarter is caretaker of & ouml ; tzi the iceman , the world ' s oldest and best - preserved mummy , and was also a member of the egyptian - led research team that examined king tut ' s ct scan images . " the pharaoh ' s sex organ is clearly visible in burton ' s pictures . all was normal in king tut . the penis is a highly vascularised organ and shrinks when it is mummified . actually , king tut has been flattered by the embalmers ' work . there is no comparison with & ouml ; tzi ' s penis ," says egarter . mummifying the penis & ouml ; tzi ' s natural mummification and dehydration in an alpine glacier produced a " collapse of the genitalia ", which left the iceman with an almost invisible member . " he would not make a bella figura today ," egarter says . according to the mummy expert , it is not possible to see if king tut was circumcised . eugene cruz - uribe , professor of history at northern arizona university and an expert on tutankhamen , says that some earlier documents mention circumcision at king tut ' s time . " it was probably done for hygienic reasons , but some ritual issues may have occurred as well ," cruz - uribe says . boy as king tut . ankh . amun , " the living image of amun ", ascended the throne in 1333 bc at the age of nine , and reigned until his death in 1325 bc , aged 19 . he married 13 - year - old ankhesenpaaten , who was probably his stepsister , on his accession to the throne . during their marriage , ankhesenpaaten , who had changed her name to ankhesenamun , gave birth to two stillborn girls . after these me now over with over has being such been were herself those yours an s
