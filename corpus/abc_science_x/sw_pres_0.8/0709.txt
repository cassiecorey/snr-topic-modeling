humpback whales have surprisingly complex brains , which raises questions about how these cetaceans evolved humpback whales have a type of brain cell seen only in humans , the great apes , and other cetaceans such as dolphins , us researchers report . this might mean such whales are more intelligent than they have been given credit for , the scientists say . and it suggests the basis for complex brains either evolved more than once , or has gone unused by most animal species . the finding may help explain some whale behaviours , such as intricate communication skills , the formation of alliances , cooperation , cultural transmission and the use of tools , the researchers report in journal the anatomical record . professor patrick hof and colleagues from the mount sinai school of medicine in new york discovered a type of cell called a spindle neurone in the cortex of the whale brains . they found the cells in areas comparable to where they are seen in humans and great apes . although the function of spindle neurones is not well understood , they may be involved in cognition - learning , remembering and recognising the world . spindle cells may be affected by alzheimer ' s disease and other debilitating brain disorders such as autism and schizophrenia . complex social patterns the researches found spindle neurones in the same location in toothed whales with the largest brains , which the researchers say suggests the cells may be related to brain size . toothed whales such as orcas are generally considered more intelligent than baleen whales such as humpbacks and blue whales , which filter water for their food . the humpbacks also have structures that resemble ' islands ' in the cerebral cortex , also seen in some other mammals . these islands may have evolved to promote fast and efficient communication between neurones , the researchers say . spindle neurones probably first appeared in the common ancestor of hominids , humans and great apes about 15 million years ago , the researchers say . they are not seen in lesser apes or monkeys . in cetaceans they would have evolved earlier , possibly as early as 30 million years ago , the researchers say . how did these cells evolve ? either the spindle neurones were only kept in the animals with the largest brains or they evolved several times independently , the researchers say . " in spite of the relative scarcity of information on many cetacean species , it is important to note in this context that sperm whales , killer whales , and certainly humpback whales , exhibit complex social patterns that included intricate communication skills , coalition - formation , cooperation , cultural transmission and tool usage ," the researchers write . " it is thus likely that some of these abilities are related to comparable histological complexity in brain organisation in cetaceans and in hominids ." most until themselves then that hers your were
