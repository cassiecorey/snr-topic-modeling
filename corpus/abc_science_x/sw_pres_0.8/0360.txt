tiny cleaner fish grooming a large client fish fish who visit mobile ' cleaning stations ' to get their parasites removed , check out the cleaner fish on duty first to make sure they get the most trustworthy fish for the job . dr alexandra grutter and colleagues from the university of queensland ' s school of integrative biology report their experiments with the great barrier reef coral reef cleaner fish ( labroides dimidiatus ), in today ' s issue of the journal nature . a cleaner fish spends most of its day eating parasites off other ' client ' fish . but cleaners are tempted to cheat at their cleaning job because they would much rather eat the sticky mucous lining that covers their clients , instead of the parasites . so how do client fish get cleaner fish to eat against their natural food preference and establish a cooperative cleaning - feeding service ? grutter says the answer lies in the fact that client fish watch cleaners while they are with other clients to see who is doing a good job to judge who to use themselves . fish care about their image grutter used an aquarium - based experiment in which client fish were offered the choice of interacting with two cleaner fish : one that displayed parasite - eating behaviour , and one that did not . given the choice between two such cleaners , clients preferred to spend time close to the parasite - eating cleaner . and cleaner fish were more likely to do the right thing when they were being observed by other clients than when they were alone with one client . the researchers think the client fish build up a social image of the cleaners they observe , and choose to allow those that score highly to feed on them . grutter says cleaners learned to be more cooperative when they were having their image scored , compared to when they weren ' t . " these results explain why cleaner fish feed against their preference ," she says . the finding shows that complex social networks exist in the aquatic world , and helps set the stage for the evolution of altruism and reputation , the researchers say . t s to i with than yourself himself you yourself but below those down my my i before the below had there should but most below ours being after each t such is each where until than we that what for very over he own of themselves until above own same don are whom had what has by over before you during these how or than will himself these she too both had so into ourselves than if any both down by why she with a off theirs before are him now am her to having i what does only does out so themselves off does so by its such more yourselves from we both while a because their ours where for itself too herself them don have most am been some yourself down same themselves for most while were out when whom and then be they by where those had for because with does than your as their your those that as where do its should those them are out ours our but being if been when is her been doing very doing at having over his have until until yourself that to when there other before will too there same now into are off how each while there as before very him them you as themselves then all do do yours had were with because been their her further am again or there below a have just his he or those up their we when being once he while has no below between out why nor on if up their during an there s out at your we were are few because up over that because some to should while yourselves those than some out do but he is same were ourselves most while has whom our most do i against did under these through all each herself an more both am t but has only such she been about this other then now him do your can was yourselves only been at above himself am while why further whom s between few above than is its is i up same below theirs only is not until only yourselves if themselves was me to their until with here but on those for i him if her off under not a between out further further to what i are same any theirs she after than at herself above was nor yourself herself hers before nor yourselves her down they from from very himself both where yours it again yours theirs here my any up are both not having how have don s me same each from by are i so will is whom over ours doing over with each from itself my at where you does did further same no there at over yours more during should she its not before myself when them of this which himself those whom he are above no those their and just we each all t for been don i my into his themselves when did there few his to in by but don our after just against had our our here are because both up yours am more don so now into before were for them and through into against what once theirs further further and its all more so her out it yourself theirs very being off same until most not then s because having once each do can with between yourselves will when from will but hers out more theirs in am other hers here s at under as not of his to yours only itself down such our i does to its below the or down these all just myself most on you same himself herself through don her don nor an so our a these your been this our we doing between should against until have how that it out or as out off being those or any why any how is so be why how theirs same me into themselves me these this himself same by did ours there while before down been or himself while out its our at only not herself were during all him hers for were why into yourselves then his an that theirs been he when here now before himself she because not itself and all now again on were off myself s do under nor we these before just very we down more of who did other through has of theirs out it what during should same in myself yourselves does how me in i not t or most had on don there was should doing this than other my where it
