caffeine is more likely to disrupt a daytime snooze than a normal night ' s sleep shiftworkers or people with jet lag who drink coffee to keep themselves awake may not be able to catnap the next day , say canadian researchers . they report online in the journal neuropsychopharmacology that caffeine has a stronger disruptive effect on daytime , catch - up sleep after a night of sleep deprivation than it does on a normal night ' s sleep . " recent studies have suggested that caffeine is a measure of choice to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation on alertness and performance ," say dr julie carrier of montreal ' s sacred heart hospital and colleagues . " our results suggest that this recommendation should be made with caution since using caffeine before sleeping at an abnormal circadian phase , such as during night work , might have more adverse consequences on sleep quality than before sleeping at a normal circadian time ." drinking caffeine at night is known to make it more difficult to fall asleep and to worsen sleep quality , carrier and her team note . they hypothesised that caffeine would have an even stronger effect when people were trying to recover from sleep deprivation by snoozing during the day . to investigate , they asked 34 people drink caffeine or placebo before going to sleep at their normal bedtime . a month later , the same people were deprived of sleep for an entire night . they were then told to fall asleep an hour after their normal wake - up time , after being given placebo or caffeine . people received 100 milligrams of caffeine or placebo before their scheduled morning or evening bedtime , and then another 100 milligrams ( or placebo ) one hour before . sleeping after caffeine all study participants who took caffeine took longer to fall asleep and spent more time in lighter stage 1 sleep and less time in deeper stage 2 and slow - wave sleep , the researchers found . but people given caffeine before daytime sleep took even longer to drop off , and also slept for a shorter total time and had less rem sleep . caffeine didn ' t affect night time sleep duration or rem . carrier and her colleagues suggest that the greater daytime effects of caffeine are due to the fact that people are trying to fall asleep at a time when their body clock is telling them to stay awake , even though they are sleep - deprived . slow - wave sleep is known to last longer during daytime , catch - up sleep , they add , which normally helps override this circadian signal . given that caffeine reduces slow - wave sleep , it appears to allow the wake - up call to remain strong . was its am s ours themselves a over
