psychologists says the secret of good batting is being able to anticipate the intent of the bowler the best batsmen can predict the sort of ball a bowler ' s going to deliver before it even leaves his hands , a new study into the psychology of cricket shows . less successful batsmen aren ' t so highly attuned to subtle visual clues , reports dr sean müller of rmit university in the latest issue of the quarterly journal of experimental psychology . müller ' s study shows that a top batsman can predict how a ball will swing and where it will bounce well before it ' s airborne . "[ experienced players ] can pick up ... cues that the intermediate and novice players don ' t or aren ' t sensitive to ," he says . a less skilled batsman can only make these judgements once the ball is in flight , giving him less time to get in the right position . time is critical as it can take just half a second from when the ball leaves the bowler ' s hand to it reaching the crease . video simulations müller put members of the australian cricket team through a number of tests , which were also repeated on intermediate and novice cricket players . participants included former captain steve waugh and ricky ponting , who ' ll skipper australia when it faces england in the first ashes test in brisbane next week . in one test , the subjects were shown a video of a bowler running up , from the batsman ' s point of view . the video was stopped at various stages of the run - up and delivery , and subjects were required to make a prediction about the ball based on this limited information . they were also shown a video with various parts of the bowler ' s body blocked out , for example , with just a hand . " we occluded all of the bowler ... so you ' d see this little hand running in all the way from the start and then it ' ll stop , the screen will go black at the point of ball release ," he says . experiments were also carried out on the field with batsmen wearing goggles that blacked out parts of the bowler ' s body . inherent or learnt skill ? müller says it appears that movement - related cue - reading is subconscious , because even the batsmen who were best at anticipating the bowler ' s intention couldn ' t specify why . müller says while some people may be naturally more attuned to picking up visual cues , it ' s likely this can be taught and learned . " you need to be exposed to different types of bowlers , different ways the ball spins , in order to learn the relationship between a cue and what will actually happen ," he says . " it takes time to develop [ this skill ] and practice is needed ." can we improve batting ? his next study will look at whether videos and goggles can be used to refine predictive ability and improve batting . " if a player is going through a slump you could use this method to pick up if they need remedial work in picking up particular cues ," he says . the study has other practical implications . müller says honing our skills of predictive judgement can make us better drivers or help us cross roads more safely . he says humans probably developed predictive judgement as an evolutionary skill to help avoid injury or attack . müller was a phd student at the university of queensland when he conducted the research . been which again you herself from no her was above he doing t into but hers under we
