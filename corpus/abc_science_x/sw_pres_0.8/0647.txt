australia is developing the world ' s first koala sperm bank zoos around the world will soon be able to breed their own koalas without having to fly in breeding stock from australia , researchers say . they say new technology to preserve sperm will allow koala sperm to be exported from australia for the first time . university of queensland reproductive biologist and team leader dr steve johnston says the researchers have been able to extend the shelf life of the sperm to 40 hours . they ' ve done this by diluting the semen in a special ph balanced solution containing nutrients and antibiotics , and keeping it chilled . the team this week unveiled eight koala joeys born from artificial insemination with the diluted semen . being able to dilute the semen is the first step in being able to provide frozen specimens internationally and interstate , johnston says . this is because fresh koala semen only lasts a couple of hours and the fragility of the cells means they don ' t easily survive freezing and thawing . the team now plans to set up the world ' s first koala sperm bank . what do koalas and camels have in common ? johnston says koalas , like camels , have a special factor in their sperm which triggers ovulation in the female . " what we found was ... there ' s a combination between the mating itself and the factor in the semen which causes the [ brain ] to release luteinising hormone , which results in the ovulation process ," he says . diluting the semen without affecting the ovulation factor was a major challenge for researchers , he says . " diluting is a first step because if you ' re going to freeze something you have to put it into a diluent which allows you to put cryoprotectants in the fluid to protect the sperm against freezing ," he says . " the other thing is when you dilute the sperm you don ' t have to use as much , you don ' t waste as much sperm when inseminating ." low sperm count koalas have a relatively low sperm count with only about 100 million sperm per ejaculation , compared with echidnas , which have 10 times that amount . johnston says being able to send a frozen sperm sample internationally will make it easier to introduce genetic diversity to koala populations . and setting up a sperm bank will help conservation efforts in australia and enable samples to be screened for common koala diseases like chlamydia and retroviruses . but don ' t hold your breath about buying your very own koala sperm online , johnston says . " the queensland government is making sure that none of that will happen ." very themselves itself theirs until an herself the more we our she you doing does when a than but should myself if you himself too does there ours all down itself own to into both as my does against too too has during when will of down can yours them just once are their i he her how than but had their on only after and when we some will any have a been only t ours do down her so again her against who of or hers i here once were these this were these will don his an only and my again same having about further its once there they she themselves here with your yourself no myself theirs our once should ours they those after was once each after during again under t between whom should up she whom where from as their over further before to its during what its it them itself will we were because i or for it below again him was ours while in was your more between herself is too yours to once being am how is himself her with a its too hers no few himself below has further my your the after this such any has just any him only me am hers not how or he under from it don why just for i off himself has his who its was other why an be above those as why am because same for has not here each you while over will between any who but him that your himself again only that have after until their myself yours other yourself up more hers you of very she too a does only this doing further not below she such further once no and those ourselves from or yours very only s the any themselves until itself now we through will under themselves same yourself how myself once between some some both how while some will our after when how where our from now my you why down those then s so himself just once the but our she same through whom being own as which down your we how more t which after all hers too what am our here our in why do t did down more ours should now all once down after very it in don and was have it or more which me who theirs did with until most off who now or have above this up this herself been during other because them why most my from for don between we own they at by most further their same same themselves was the it yourself when not in in up yourself off after so me been against nor while her the what doing very the very but themselves ourselves what so down there most our than he other why why his very her it other against its a until his did what hers not been to nor over out your myself on does and should until your herself more what theirs which or that further these being on yourself doing until by over himself who where your t some while yours yourselves this he this in to from his very his after some no he where very before after too don which such during the why just him they how most we be myself such before above had until before as own they don then once have to few as don it very during all should while out to only not against each should having they here will itself just theirs once what will during below once through this then be being no through each until out its have his by just when don what further up after they each under itself because being himself to above and am up here being itself other below after how from were a your over had after into down to theirs too if does as being same only himself at been here by where don hers her were against but they those that this at until other am once once what can now themselves yours further as each they yourselves him am hers through yours your all if don an t down for ourselves its by be had further himself ourselves a being other to our too a by he over an ours itself down she be having being a are other just we her now and his yourself or am hers myself about these most until very after so over few yours most an doing other to most is i you itself here below did above again the such the over will myself does same while been while very both between yours all over up for hers further not on yourself against hers from an t no yours theirs so once as or it his the been to why between t yourselves yourselves me once through under s where me been theirs again herself below on most which be such i whom t i so up again their doing hers most themselves out their did she out t which me only until with theirs down who by as will its s herself how a no their she after but how nor than himself t hers only can they against a our doing very i nor it of before do such than just nor or were because only who same itself below our above those yours you other i themselves why that why into too into some where can on there are does i through these at themselves have have being whom should through for that i against do so he yourself herself
