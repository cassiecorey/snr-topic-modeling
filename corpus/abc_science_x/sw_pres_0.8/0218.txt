the new ground - based telescope will give images 10 times crisper than the hubble space telescope australian astronomers have joined a consortium building the world ' s largest telescope , which from 2015 will help scientists understand the evolution of the universe . the australian national university has become equal partners with eight us institutions to design the us $ 500 million ( a $ 671 million ) optical and infrared giant magellan telescope . the new telescope is to be built in chile and will consist of six mirrors surrounding a central mirror , with each mirror 8 . 4 metres across . at an overall diameter of 21 metres , the new telescope will be the first of a generation of so - called extremely large telescopes designed to probe the depths of the universe . " the largest telescopes that astronomers have access to right now have diameters between 8 and 10 metres ," says professor penny sackett , director of the university ' s research school of astronomy and astrophysics , based at mount stromlo in canberra . " extremely large telescopes have diameters of 20 to 30 to 50 metres ." sackett says the light - gathering power increases with the square of the diameter of a telescope . " when you go from an 8 metre to a 24 metre [ telescope ] you ' ve actually increased your light - gathering power by a factor of nine not by a factor of three ." light from distant stars she says the telescope ' s enormous diameter will allow it to detect light from the most distant stars in the universe . the light has taken so long to reach earth it is almost the age of the universe which means it gives astronomers a picture of the universe right after it was born , says sackett . she says the giant magellan telescope will be the first telescope to directly detect light from planets that are just forming around other stars . the telescope will also allow astronomers to study dark matter and dark energy , which influence the geometry of the universe . " dark matter and dark energy are the forces that tug and pull on the fabric of space - time . they determine how the universe evolves over time ," she says . clear focus sackett says the telescope will have " adaptive optics ", new technology that undoes the blurring effects of the earth ' s atmosphere . " the mirrors move very quickly to put the light rays back in the right place by bouncing them at slightly different angles ," she says . " the giant magellan telescope should be able to take pictures that are 10 times crisper , 10 times sharper , 10 times more detailed that the hubble space telescope ." partnership in the new telescope will give australian astronomers access to an extremely large telescope , which , according to the decadal plan for astronomy , is one of the two items australian astronomers say are the most important to their future a decade from now . sackett says that australian industries and academic institutions could also benefit from contracts to design and build instruments for the new telescope . other members of the consortium are the carnegie institution of washington , harvard university , massachusetts institute of technology , university of arizona , university of michigan , smithsonian institution , university of texas at austin and texas a & m university . when if yourself up whom ours why me t few there until who both am herself before do these we itself can i both was as itself
