the turtles are an important source of protein for aboriginal people and children are taught to hunt them from an early age feral pigs are threatening the northern snake - necked turtle population in arnhem land to the point where the species could become extinct in some areas , australian researchers predict . in a single experiment , feral pigs killed 96 % of radio - tracked turtles in a monitored area within a three - month period . " they dig them up like truffles ," says phd candidate damien fordham , of the university of canberra , whose research will be published in the journal biological conservation . fordham says while the turtles are found across northern australia , the consequences of extinction for the local indigenous population would be " extreme ". northern snake - necked turtles have traditionally provided an important seasonal source of protein for indigenous communities in arnhem land . not only would indigenous communities lose a valuable source of bush tucker , but with it the strong cultural ties they have with the turtle . fordham and colleagues mounted tiny radio tracking devices to the shells of 40 snake - necked turtles around waterholes in indigenous land around maningrida , 450 kilometres east of darwin . turtles aestivate , or dig themselves into the mud , to escape heat and lack of water during the late dry season , anywhere between august to december . of the 28 recorded turtle deaths during the 12 - week period , 27 were attributed to feral pigs . researchers believe feral pigs could have stumbled upon , and then eaten , some of the turtles while they were rooting around billabongs in search of morsels such as water chestnut . but it was clear that in 11 of 27 turtle deaths the pigs had specifically located and dug them up . generally , pigs make a huge mess at they root around looking for food , but researchers noted relatively undisturbed areas around the 11 turtle deaths , indicating a direct ' hit '. " this is disturbing as it indicates that pigs actively seek out and prey on aestivating turtles ," fordham says . the researchers predict more turtles will die as the feral pig population increases . mathematical modelling of how many turtles survive in the year of the study , if carried across all years , could led to distinction of the turtles in the region , the researchers note . researchers say the turtle ' s best hope for survival is a few years of good rainfall , when pig predation rates are low . fordham would also like to see government funding to ' fence in ' turtle - rich areas .
