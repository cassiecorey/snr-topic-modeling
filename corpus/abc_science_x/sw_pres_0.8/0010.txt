landslides like this one in pakistan earlier this week may become more common if climate change increases rainfall , scientists say heavier rainfall as a result of climate change could loosen soils making landslides more common , un experts say . this may risk hillside slums in latin america to antiquities in egypt ' s valley of the kings , according to scientists meeting in tokyo this week to discuss ways to prevent and ease damage from landslides . " if climate change predictions are accurate you will expect ... more intense and extreme rainfalls ," says professor srikantha herath , senior academic officer of the un university . a report released at the time of the meeting says some cultural sites are at risk from landslides , including the valley of the kings where egypt ' s pharaohs are buried , the inca mountain fortress of machu picchu in peru and china ' s huaqing palace dating from the tang dynasty . " special attention should be given to cultural and natural heritage sites of universal and irreplaceable values ," says professor kyoji sassa , director of the disaster prevention research institute at japan ' s kyoto university . " in some places , particularly in developing countries , the natural threats are being exacerbated by rapid tourism development ," he says . early warning herath says the tokyo talks are likely to call for better monitoring and early warning systems , special protection of cultural sites , better preparedness and quick aid for victims . he says it is impossible to say if global warming is already causing more landslides . of natural disasters , landslides are the seventh biggest killer behind droughts , storms , floods , earthquakes , volcanoes and extreme temperatures , according to the report for the un university , kyoto university and unesco . among severe landslides , about 2800 died in cholima in honduras in 1973 and almost 1200 in northern italy in 1963 . the louvain university database on which the figures are based often excludes landslides triggered by earthquakes . unstable hillsides in many poor nations , many people were forced to live on unstable hillsides , away from flat plains exploited for farming . " late arrivals are always settling in the most dangerous land ," says professor janos bogardi , director of the un university institute for environment and human security . he says that better building codes and simply giving out information about the risks of mudslides could save lives . asia suffered most with 220 landslides in the past century out of about 500 that caused human deaths , the scientists say . many of the most deadly mudslides were in latin america and the costliest in europe . about 800 - 1000 people died in landslides in each of the past 20 years , the un university says . will few each ourselves itself any we into by own own while once here between off each we these or yourselves itself can are in nor yourself only doing up my from don when as those am hers my
