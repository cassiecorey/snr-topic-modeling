this costa rican zebra tarantula has an archaic way of sticking to surfaces tarantulas secrete sticky silk from their feet to help them adhere to shiny surfaces , says an international team of scientists . spiders are already known to have two mechanisms that allow them to walk upside or cling to smooth vertical surfaces . one is the use of thousands of tiny hairs that generate a weak electrical bond , using van der waals forces , with the surface . another is tiny claws that lock onto rough surfaces . but scientists at the max planck institute for metals research in stuttgart and us colleagues have now found , in tarantulas at least , there is a third gripping tool . tarantulas have microscopic nozzle - like structures on their feet that secrete a viscous silk - like filament . the researchers report their results today in the journal nature . the team carried out its research with zebra tarantulas ( aphonopelma seemanni ) from costa rica , which were induced to walk around a slick , vertical glass surface . to walk up , the spiders used their distal claws to keep a grip . to walk down , they exuded fibres between 0 . 2 and 1 . 0 micrometres in diameter from all four pairs of feet that adhered to the glass and stopped them sliding and falling . the german team , led by dr stanislav gorb at the institute ' s evolutionary biomaterials group , says the new discovery raises questions about spiders ' evolutionary past . arachnids also have an abdominal pouch , a spinneret , which produces the silk to make webs . gorb theorises that spiders may have started making silk with their feet before they began to do so with their spinnerets , as this would have helped their survival by avoiding catastrophic falls . the next step is to carry out a genetic analysis of the foot silk proteins to compare it to the spinneret silk proteins . industrial chemists study spider silk as they are eager to make a synthetic copy that mimics its strength and resilience . own been above ours now why whom other if his when above theirs both because his should up but under just was but are myself by his did again to should at most be are now more off than
