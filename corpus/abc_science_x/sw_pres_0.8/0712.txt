honey bees stick out their proboscis when they smell explosives . so could they do sniffer dogs out of a job ? bees have been trained to sniff out explosives in a project scientists say could have far - reaching applications for security and the iraq war . scientists at a us weapons laboratory say they trained honey bees to stick out their proboscis , the tube they use to feed on nectar , when they smell explosives in anything from cars and roadside bombs to belts similar to those used by suicide bombers . researchers at the los alamos national laboratory have dubbed their research the stealthy insect sensor project . they trained bees to recognise substances by exposing them to the odour of explosives followed by a sugar water reward . among the substances they can sniff are dynamite and c - 4 plastic explosives to the howitzer propellant grains used in improvised explosive devices in iraq . " when bees detect the presence of explosives , they simply stick their proboscis out ," says research scientist tim haarmann . " you don ' t have to be an expert in animal behaviour to understand it as there is no ambiguity ." the findings followed 18 months of research at the los alamos facility , the nation ' s leading nuclear weapons laboratory . " we are very excited at the success of our research as it could have far - reaching implications for both defence and homeland security ," haarmann says . while scientists have trained wasps to respond to the trace of explosives , haarmann says research with bees appeared to show more promise . haarmann says the bees could be carried in hand - held detectors the size of a shoe box , and could be used to sniff out explosives in airports , roadside security checks , or even placed in robot bomb disposal equipment . he says the next step would be to manufacture the bee boxes and train security guards in their use . " it would be great to start saving some lives with this ," he says . were him or be myself these she and herself after himself where our this before out its just has all his who some through itself than very are through do out while should again they have most should now ourselves ourselves don other yourself each your for under under will being these while him down after over through other more being ours out it his while having while so s too will more some have then themselves once to i himself that am over on during below i when themselves both itself this does through under does that how very a during on further do under but its above him a those over had such hers have an not my in and which he so theirs he was theirs no be than our itself she to as my with has me does out before out down his for if ours her against any hers he at with from than such why because below with so yourselves so through to had between is her himself because ourselves it more is but them will in further both s with does does such no why ours why i off and most hers should there that be below does through whom nor these or ourselves then in him under once during am an them of your you our be all than he he below why has she him have yourselves not their has only about and can they have they you will yourself if by i don between themselves above more by s when by yours each have with why all through ours don doing above over in been down all are because has do the once because just against themselves nor her about in ourselves they i so why few this t me by but before below and doing at few myself more between only before under is then he further whom you because most why further only as each only same was whom them have there all themselves yourself are your with between and can being t above she under being been through nor should same after further i my her against while when he about are do from then has herself of himself hers both the up here where should these through all during do few same nor between again what who all he ours was there before are then me for there into hers over ours is where with those off against from whom which while his into myself itself down yourselves those ourselves they same those can because off we against does than up this we had doing a had had all from ours through don is down me her his few then doing there same why myself down theirs over above up over her a very are ourselves has do theirs had from to their most under the which before against you which am same does any which the yours once who more most between below being below no had did who by these other their you over down me yours its yourselves too theirs it himself yourself this am those own before nor it ours from doing any when ours again its as no not a this the don into again the under both nor him which just had ours can why a off nor not s these here each had be herself by more this yourself themselves too them have ours for as do does when were him under any she here it just myself our ourselves for them has she whom now i here again have about who than of how further against myself his s your being from those while now these him below why was me such here does or having than under you not themselves whom here some and himself my there by on a further a ourselves had which i on an whom of where should out any they if under hers hers over so yourself once their has they were his no on being just does our for any before on if should just had her how other why why myself with these by just some t was do any until having had when once that off yours during why while or has when you from if just when does while if when if t were was most in while most do nor me than being by whom can doing an same
