genes that control head size are puzzling researchers who say they may also play a role outside the brain the genes that are thought to have helped humans evolve big brains don ' t appear to play any role in how intelligent we are , according to a dna study . this backs separate research that has failed to come up with a link between head size and intelligence , except in extreme congenital abnormalities . the queensland institute of medical research ( qmir ) study is the first to specifically look at genes , head size and intelligence in a normal population . the australian study found that people who scored highly in intelligence tests didn ' t necessarily possess versions of the genes that were expected to code for big heads and intelligence . and people who did possess the suspected ' smart ' versions of the genes weren ' t necessarily the most intelligent or the ones with the biggest brains . the study will be presented at the 11th international congress of human genetics in brisbane next week . head space the researchers tested 4395 teenagers for head size and intelligence . they also looked at the genes aspm , mcph1 and cdk5rap2 , which regulate brain size and activity . when mutated , these genes result in an abnormally small brain , a condition known as congenital microcephaly . " normal variation in these genes has not yet been investigated in relation to head size and intelligence ," says dr michelle luciano , a research fellow at qmir . she says the only comparable previous study used mri imaging to measure brain volume in relation to two microcephaly genes . " their findings [ about a relation to brain size ] were negative and they didn ' t find a relationship with two of the genes we were looking at ," she says . " we decided to take it a step further and look at intelligence and lo and behold we find a similar negative result ." ancestral or evolved ? we all carry the three genes the qmir team investigated but some of us carry ' ancestral ', or less evolved , versions and others carry ' derived ' or more recently evolved versions . some of us carry one of each . researchers had expected that people with evolved versions of the gene would be smarter and have bigger heads , but were surprised to find this wasn ' t the case , luciano says . " we would predict that if you ' ve got the more recent version you should have a higher iq ," she says . " we actually found that not to be the case . " it is unlikely then that selective pressure for these genes is related to the evolution of intelligence in humans ." rather , she says the genes might be important for a neurological function outside the brain . are humans getting smarter ? professor colin groves , an expert in human evolution from the australian national university , says human brains began getting bigger after our earliest ancestors like homo habilis appeared . but our brains have stopped growing and have actually started getting smaller , or at least more ' compact '. "[ our brains ] have got bigger but they ' re not getting bigger ," he says . " in fact since the late pleistocene in general they ' ve got smaller ." while brain size appears to be related to intelligence between species , this doesn ' t seem to be the case within a species , groves says . and despite the development of technological advances , he says there ' s no evidence that homo sapiens has become more intelligent in the last 50 , 000 years . theirs too we so if
