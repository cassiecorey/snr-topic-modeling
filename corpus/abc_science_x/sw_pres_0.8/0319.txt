where people live will have a big impact on how technology will affect their lives , says a new report that highlights the technological divide australia is among countries that will gain the most from technology by 2020 , a study finds . but poorer countries look to miss out . the rand corporation study finds that it is countries that are already on technology ' s cutting edge , not those that are currently lagging in technological advances , which will benefit the most . " where people live will have a big impact on how technology applications affect their personal health and standard of living , and will also play a part in determining the ability of their countries to protect them and their environment ," says dr richard silberglitt , one of the lead authors . the study looked at 29 countries that were ranked as technologically advanced , proficient , developing or lagging . " people in the us and canada , germany [ representing western europe ], south korea and japan , australia and israel will benefit the most from advances in technology , and they will be able to exploit technology regardless of its sophistication ," the report concludes . as examples of potential high - tech advances , it cites growing tissue to implant and replace human body parts ; creating pervasive sensor networks in public areas to conduct real - time surveillance ; providing access to information any time and anywhere ; and creating wearable computers . " china , india , russia and others ... such as poland [ representing eastern europe ] could also make significant advances , along with simpler ones ," the report says of what it describes as scientifically proficient countries . these countries could , for example , " provide their people with drug therapies that preferentially attack specific tumors or pathogens ... [ and ] vastly improved medical diagnostic and surgical procedures ". scientifically developing countries " mexico , turkey , brazil , colombia , indonesia , south africa and chile ... are poised to take advantage of modestly sophisticated technology applications including devices to constantly track the movement of everything from products to people ; easy - to - use health diagnostic tests that give immediate results for a large range of infections ; and environmentally friendly manufacturing methods ," the study says . the scientifically lagging countries - fiji , the dominican republic , georgia , nepal , pakistan , egypt , iran , jordan , kenya , cameroon and chad - " are burdened by problem - plagued political systems , a lack or resources or infrastructure , and class disparities ," the study says . " when such countries have the will to make changes ... they can improve the lives of their citizens ," the study adds , citing examples such as cheap solar energy for remote or portable applications , ways to purify water that won ' t require major infrastructure , and rural wireless communications . china and india lead the group of scientifically proficient , the study adds . " yet they need to continue making progress in financial institutions , legal and policy issues rural infrastructure , environmental protection , research and development investments , rural education and literacy , and governance and stability if they are to advance ," it says . own because has down my hers don be such before than how few himself no you off under to other as have on by theirs why
