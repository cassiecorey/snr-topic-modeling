the length of a particular gene controls your risk of developing depression after divorce , unemployment or illness more than a fifth of the population has a genetic predisposition to major depression triggered by a string of stressful life events , australian researchers announce . these events include : the loss of a parent or other significant relative ; a relationship breakdown ; or employment , financial , housing and health crises . the study , published in the latest issue of the british journal of psychiatry , found a gene that controls the neurotransmitter serotonin is crucial . the researchers found that people with a ' short ' version of the serotonin transporter gene have an 80 % chance of developing clinical depression if they have three or more negative life events in a year . people with a ' long ', or more protective , version of the gene only have a 30 % risk of becoming depressed under similar circumstances . the study , by researchers from the university of new south wales with affiliated research institutes and teaching hospitals , evaluated the relationship between genes and life experience from young adulthood into middle age in 127 teachers across 25 years . it is the first study to account for the timing of the first onset of depression across the lifespan . the long and the short of it ' short ' and ' long ' versions of the serotonin transporter gene 5 - httlpr , located on chromosome 17 , are created by a slight variation in the sequence of dna . one version of the gene is inherited from each parent in certain combinations . according to the research , those who inherit two short versions are the most susceptible to depression . the study showed 21 % of us have two short versions of the gene , 26 % two long versions and the rest have one long and one short variant . professor philip mitchell , head of the university ' s school of psychiatry and convenor of brain sciences unsw , emphasises that this is a susceptibility or risk gene not a disease gene . " having two short versions of the gene doesn ' t make you depressed per se ; it increases the likelihood of becoming depressed if you experience stressful life events ," he says . identifying who ' s at risk mitchell says the findings could help identify people at increased risk of depression and help direct resources into preventative interventions for people with the susceptible genetic make up . " i think this will spark off important clinical debate about when tests like this should become clinically available ," he says . " the ethical question is not only whether this test should be made available publicly , but also who should have access to the results . we err on the side of privacy but private insurance bodies , for example , could demand the information as part of their risk assessment ." for information about depression , including support and referral options , see australia ' s national depression
