the findings could explain the traditional job of men as society ' s enforcers , say researchers men are likely to take pleasure when they see someone punished for acting unfairly , while women are likely to feel badly for the culprit , say neuroscientists . dr tania singer of university college london and team report their findings today online ahead of print publication in the journal nature . in a two - phase experiment , the researchers recruited 32 male and female volunteers , as well as four others who were undercover actors hired to play the role of volunteers . in the first part of the experiment , the group played a game of mutual investment in which they had to give money to one of their number . the recipient decided how much to give back from the profits . they could hand back up to triple the investment , at little reward to themselves , or hand back little or nothing , maximising their own gains at the investor ' s cost . one actor was cast in a generous role , always giving lots of money back to their partners , while another actor was cast as a meanie , giving back very little and sometimes nothing at all . body language by the volunteers , confirmed later in questionnaires , confirmed that they did not like the actors who had cheated on them . " fair " players , in contrast , were rated as more agreeable , more likeable and , remarkably , more attractive . brain imaging reveals sex differences in the second phase , the same volunteers were each placed in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner , a device which shows blood flows within the brain . the volunteer was then given a demonstration of a mild shock , the equivalent of short bee - sting , and then watched as the actors , standing next to the scanner , got the same painful treatment . when a " fair " actor received a shock , the scanner showed empathy among all the volunteers . in males and females alike , the images showed activation of the anterior insula / fronto - insular cortex ( ai / fi ) and anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ). previous research has showed that these parts of the brain cause the feeling of distress when one sees someone else in pain . when an " unfair " actor got a shock , the ai / fi and acc lit up again among most female volunteers . but amongst the men these empathic areas showed no increase in activity . reward centre activated in men men who watched " unfair " actors suffering did show an activation of their nucleus accumbens , the part of the brain associated with the satisfaction of reward . this activation was not seen in most female volunteers . singer says the results show that fairness in social situations " shapes the nature of the emotional link we have to other people . " we empathise with others if they cooperate and act fairly . but in contrast , selfish and unfair behaviour compromises this empathic link ," she says . singer believes these fundamental responses at the individual level have played a key role in social evolution . they would explain for instance why communities everywhere draw up laws or codes to punish or sideline those who cheat and freeload on the majority , she says . as for the gender difference about punishing a social offender , singer says she could not rule out the possibility that the experiment favoured men as there was a physical rather than psychological or financial threat involved . despite this limitation , she says , the results could explain the traditional job of men as society ' s enforcers . " this investigation would seem to indicate there is a predominant role for men in maintaining justice and issuing punishment ," she says . i i can why for above being between above that up myself any
