cystic fibrosis affects 30 , 000 children and young adults in the us alone inhaling the mists of salt water can reduce the pus and infection that fills the airways of cystic fibrosis sufferers , although side effects include a nasty coughing fit and a harsh taste . that ' s the conclusion of two studies published in this week ' s issue of the new england journal of medicine . they found that inhaling a mist with a salt content of 7 or 9 % improved lung function and , in some cases , produced less absenteeism from school or work . cystic fibrosis , a progressive and frequently fatal genetic disease that affects about 30 , 000 young adults and children in the us alone , is marked by a thickening of the mucus which makes it harder to clear the lungs of debris and bacteria . the salt water solution " really opens up a new avenue for approaching patients with cystic fibrosis and how to treat them ," says dr gail weinmann , of the us national heart , lung , and blood institute , which sponsored one of the studies . mark elkins of the royal prince alfred hospital in sydney , australia and colleagues authored one of the new published studies . the team found that the 83 volunteers who regularly inhaled a 7 % mist of salty water had fewer breathing problems and less absenteeism from school or work than those who inhaled a solution with a salt content of under 1 %. " adding salt [ and water ] to the airway surfaces of patients with cystic fibrosis is beneficial " for both children and adults , they conclude . all of the patients first inhaled a chemical to try to open their lung passages as much as possible . in the second study , us - based assistant profsesor scott donaldson of the university of north carolina at chapel hill and his colleagues found that a 7 % salt mist " produced a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function " because it helped hydrate the lungs . in an accompanying editorial , dr felix ratjen of the hospital for sick children in toronto , canada , cited several unpleasant side effects of the salt mist treatment including a bad taste , coughing fits and the lengthy 30 minutes it can take to administer . he added that in the study by elkins and team , patients may not have received the best long - term antibiotic treatment . that would make the inhaled salt water mist appear more effective than it would have been if people were getting a better drug , says ratjen . weinmann says limitations inherent to the treatment mean a salt water mist " may be just a first step " in treating cystic fibrosis . the
