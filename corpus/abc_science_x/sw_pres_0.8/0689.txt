new research suggests that whale communication is even more sophisticated than previously thought whales have such a broad vocal repertoire that they can call to their young , woo potential mates and even express emotions , according to researchers who have identified 622 social sounds in humpback whales . their work will be presented at the upcoming joint meetings of the acoustical society of america and the acoustical society of japan in hawaii . social sounds are brief , unpatterned noises that are distinct from lengthier , complex whale songs . the new research adds to a growing body of evidence that whales convey more meaning through vocalisations than previously thought . " i wouldn ' t say ( whales possess ) language , as that ' s a human term ," says dr rebecca dunlop , a researcher in the school of veterinary sciences at the university of queensland , who worked on the study . " whales don ' t string these sounds together like words and form sentences . it ' s more like a simple vocabulary ," she says . the scientists visually tracked 60 pods of whales migrating along the east coast of australia . the researchers used a static hydrophone array , sensitive equipment that detects sound waves , linking the whale sounds to various activities and contexts . wops , thwops and yaps they identified 622 distinct sounds , which fell into 35 basic types . these include " wops " made by females , " thwops " made by males , " yaps " made when pods split , and high pitched cries that appeared to express anger . in addition to vocalisations , the researchers found that whales send messages through body language , by breaching the surface , slapping water with their tails and blowing underwater bubbles . famous for their long , complex songs , whales also sometimes " speak " short song units individually instead of singing them . males especially seem to do this when trying to woo a female . " song is a loud broadcast signal and two singers singing at the same time is bound to be confusing to the receiver ," dunlop says . " if he ' s trying to attract a female , but doesn ' t want his signal confused with another singer in the area , then using song units in this case might be the way forward ." she thinks one reason whales are so vocal is because sound travels better in water than light , and so sight is less useful to whales than hearing . human interference dr christopher clark , director of the bioacoustics research program at cornell university , conducted a similar study on right whales . he says that just as researchers are gaining a better understanding of whale vocalisations , humans are creating so much ocean noise , through shipping , oil and gas exploration , recreational traffic and more , that we often prevent whales from communicating . " many whales have very traditional feeding grounds and their migratory routes occur along shallow coastlines , which are now some of the noisiest , most heavily impacted habitats ," he says . " the ocean area over which a whale can communicate and listen today has shriveled down to a small fraction of what it was less than a century ago ." ourselves did been be under other will about
