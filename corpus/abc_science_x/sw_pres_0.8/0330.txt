feeling itchy ? genes and gender help determine an individual ' s urge to scratch an itch , suggests a new study . the study on pruritus , otherwise known as itch , is the first to demonstrate sex differences in itch - induced scratching behaviour in animals . the researchers studied mice , but they say the findings could apply to humans and other mammals . the conclusion ? females scratched themselves 23 % more often than males did . " we haven ' t investigated the underlying mechanisms of the sex difference yet , but they usually involve gonadal [ reproductive gland ] hormones , such as oestrogen , progesterone and testosterone , either during development or in adulthood ," says professor jeffrey mogil , one of the researchers . mogil , a specialist in the genetics of pain at mcgill university in canada , and his colleagues induced itching in the mice by administering chloroquine , a malaria drug that causes itchiness . the researchers also used histamines , compounds produced by mammalian tissues to dilate small blood vessels . histamines are largely responsible for the itchiness associated with allergies , hence the relief provided by antihistamines . the team ' s findings are published online in the journal pain . mogil says itch is one of the most common reasons people seek medical care . he explains that pruritus is an important symptom of many skin , systemic and autoimmune diseases . numerous medications , such as the malaria drug administered to the mice , cause itching as a troubling side effect . itching can also be a chronic condition in its own right . are you in pain ? the most common reason people seek medical attention , of course , is pain . interestingly enough , mogil and his team found that individuals sensitive to pain are more resistant to itch , while those with less pain sensitivity have a greater tendency to scratch . " i think pain and itch are wired up in the brain as opposites , in a sense , such that inheriting particular forms of pain / itch - relevant genes would simultaneously make you more sensitive to pain and less sensitive to itch , or vice versa ," he speculates . the researchers pointed out that scratching to the point of pain is a well - known strategy for alleviating itch . conversely , pain medications and local anesthesia often intensify histamine - induced itching . women feel the pain the pain - itch correlation , however , is complicated by findings from another study last year in the journal plastic and reconstructive surgery , which found that women feel pain more intensely than men do . dr bradon wilhelmi , a plastic surgeon who authored the paper , discovered that women have , on average , 34 nerve fibres per square centimetre of facial skin while men only possess around 17 nerve fibres over the same area . " because women have more nerve receptors , they may experience pain more powerfully than men , requiring different surgical techniques , treatments or medicine dosages to help manage their pain and make them feel comfortable ," wilhelmi says . it could be that women are more sensitive than men to both pain and itch , or that women have evolved some level of pain tolerance , perhaps due to giving birth . mogil hopes future research will show which genes turn the urge to itch up or down , how the proteins made by those genes work , and how the same genes may be linked to pain sensitivity .
