exercise seems to put a brake on runaway cell growth , one of the hallmarks of cancer the anticancer effects of exercise are due to increases in a protein that blocks cell growth and induces cell death , say australian researchers . this would slow down runaway cell growth , one of the hallmarks of cancer , the researchers suggest . but the team , led by dr andrew haydon from monash medical school in melbourne , cannot say how much exercise someone needs to show these effects . the researchers publish their results in the may issue of the journal gut . they identified new cases of colorectal cancer in a prospective study of 41 , 528 adults recruited between 1990 and 1994 . they then looked at baseline body mass index , level of physical activity reported and compared baseline levels of two proteins : insulin - like growth factor binding protein - 3 , or igfbp - 3 , and insulin - like growth factor - 1 , or igf - 1 . analyses centered on 443 colon cancer patients followed for more than 5 years . among subjects who were physically active , an increase in igfbp - 3 was associated with a 48 % reduction in colon cancer - specific deaths . there seemed to be no association with igf - 1 . for the physically inactive , there was no association between igf - 1 or igfbp - 3 and colon cancer survival . the researchers conclude that increased levels of igfbp - 3 with exercise blocks igf - 1 ' s proliferative effect on cell growth . igf - 1 has been shown to stimulate cell growth , inhibit cell death , and promote angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels , which tumors need to grow . " we did not look at the amount of physical activity needed to reduce colorectal cancer incidence ," haydon points out . " other studies ... have shown a dose - effect , meaning the more exercise the lower the risk . however , our study did not try to address this issue . " we were examining the effect of physical activity on one ' s prognosis following a diagnosis of bowel cancer and the possible mechanisms behind this effect ." for more information about cancer ,
