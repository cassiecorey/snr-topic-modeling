polonium interferes with the body ' s ability to repair itself polonium - 210 , the highly toxic radioactive isotope found in the body of poisoned former russian spy alexander litvinenko is a very rare , exotic material that is difficult to obtain , scientists say . the uk ' s health protection agency says litvinenko , who died last week in a london hospital , had a significant amount of the radioactive isotope in his body . but how it got there and where it came from is a mystery . radiation and chemistry experts say large - scale equipment , such as a nuclear reactor , would be needed to produce sufficient amounts to kill . " it is not as simple as the idea that somebody might have broken into a radioactivity cabinet at some local hospital and walked off with some polonium ," says dr andrea sella , a lecturer in chemistry at university college london . although scientists would not speculate on the source of the polonium , sella says litvinenko ' s death is not a random killing . " this is not a tool chosen by a group of amateurs . these people had some serious resources behind them ," he says . polonium is a by - product of uranium that was discovered by polish chemist marie curie in the late 19th century . it ' s a rare but naturally occurring metalloid found in the soil and atmosphere , and even in the human body . but at high doses it is highly toxic if ingested or inhaled ; it emits alpha particles that can damage the body ' s tissues and organs . "[ alpha particles ] are unable to penetrate a sheet of paper and so it is not a hazard unless ingested ," says professor william gelletly of the university of surrey . long - term exposure to radiation can cause mutations and cancer . but exposure to a short , intense burst of radiation causes major damage to key control centres in cells . " an alpha particle strikes a strand of dna . it snips it in two , which is bad news , or glues two strands together . either way normal cell repair mechanisms may be unable to sort that out ," says sella . " the result is that essentially the cellular command and control network [ in the body ] falls apart . that is what radiation sickness is all about ." professor david ray , of the university of nottingham , says even if a high dose of radiation could not be detected externally after litvinenko was admitted to hospital a fatal dose could have concentrated in deep tissues such as bone marrow . " the limited information that has been released about mr litvinenko ' s condition and the timing of his death is consistent with either radiation poisoning or chemicals that stop cell division ," he says . polonium - 210 also has a very short half - life of 138 days , at which point it loses half of its radioactivity . " that is long enough so you can handle it and deliver it to your target and it will pack a punch ," sella says . polonium - 210 is used in research and medicine , as well as a heating source for space components . but in those forms it is not conducive to easy poisoning , scientists say . where same between both ours me hers for her and yours their should himself what i which am between who
