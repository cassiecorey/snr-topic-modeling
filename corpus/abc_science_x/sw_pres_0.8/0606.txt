the way the earth wobbles on its axis , like a poorly balanced spinning top , influences our climate and therefore species ' survival climate change , naturally induced by tiny shifts in earth ' s rotational axis and orbit , periodically wipes out species of mammals , a study says . palaeontologists have long puzzled over fossil records that , remarkably , suggest mammal species tend to last around two and a half million years before becoming extinct . climate experts and biologists led by jan van dam at the university of utrecht in the netherlands , overlaid a picture of species emergence and extinction with changes that occur in earth ' s orbit and axis . the earth ' s orbit is not a perfect circle . it is slightly elliptical , and the ellipticality itself goes through cycles of change that span roughly 100 , 000 and 400 , 000 years . its axis , likewise , is not perfectly perpendicular but has a slight wobble , rather like a poorly - balanced child ' s top , which goes through cycles of 21 , 000 years . in addition , the axis , as schoolbooks tell us , is also tilted , and this tilt also varies in a cycle of 41 , 000 years . these three shifts in earth ' s pattern of movement are relatively minor compared with those of other planets . but they can greatly influence the amount of heat and light the earth receives from the sun . the effect can be amplified , causing global cooling , affecting precipitation patterns and even creating ice ages in higher latitudes , when two or all the cycles peak together . van dam ' s team looked at 132 species of mammal fossils recovered from three sites in spain , in layers of soil that dated from 24 . 5 million years ago to 2 . 5 million years ago . what the researchers looked for were the fossilised teeth of rodents , mainly because these could be spotted and identified much quicker than the remains of other animals . they found that rodent species bit the dust in two regular waves . one wave of extinction was roughly every 2 . 4 million years or so and the other was about every million years or so , coinciding with extremes in the cycles of ellipticality , wobble and tilt . these were not swift , massive die - outs of the kind that famously wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , but rather a fade - out of species that could not cope with habitat loss or competition , especially when ice ages kicked in . as they became extinct , other species emerged . " at any given time , there would be around 15 [ rodent ] species in residence ," says van dam . " during the extinction waves , about five or six species would disappear over a period of about 100 , 000 years or so ." the paper , which appears today in the journal nature , is confident that the species turnover among rodents also happened to other mammals and possibly other biological groups too . astronomical impact " provides a crucial missing piece in the puzzle " of regular species turnover , it says . as not will on hers t any all during him t off she or whom why doing having in some his during they into why too will been themselves after against in my be below own once you am
