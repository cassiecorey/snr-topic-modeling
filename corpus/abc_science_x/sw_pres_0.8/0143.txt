whether your brain triggers you to act violently or not is determined by a complex mix of genes and environment people who are genetically predisposed to violence have a different brain structure to others , a new study suggests . dr daniel weinberger , of the us national institute of mental health and team report their findings in today ' s issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science . "[ our ] data identify neural mechanisms associated with one specific gene epidemiologically associated with risk for violent and impulsive behaviour ," they say . the gene , which is carried on the x chromosome , produces an enzyme that mops up stress hormones in the brain . some researchers suggest that a certain form of this monoamine oxidase a ( maoa ) gene is linked to violent behaviour . according to australian neurogeneticist professor peter schofield the most profound demonstration of the link was a study more than 10 years ago of a rare family in the netherlands that had a catastrophic mutation in that gene . " all the males in that family with that mutation were arsonists and rapists ," says schofield , who heads the prince of wales medical research institute in sydney . in addition , he says , animal studies have shown that mice without an maoa gene have aggressive tendencies . these drastic exceptions aside , the maoa gene occurs naturally in all of us in one of two forms , one that expresses the enzyme at very low levels , and one that expresses it at high levels . some researchers think that there might be a correlation between the low - expressing form and violent behaviour . but a study done a few years ago , of 1000 men born in the new zealand city of dunedin , found no direct link between the gene form and violent behaviour . what they did find was an indirect link : those men who had the low - expressing version of the maoa gene and had been abused as children were far more prone to violent behaviour . now , weinberger and team have tried to find out more about how this complex interaction of genes and environment works . the study weinberger and team studied the genes and brains of 142 healthy men and women , who had no history of violence . the researchers showed the study participants pictures of angry and fearful faces and monitored the structure and function of their brains using magnetic resonance imaging . they found those with the low - expressing version of maoa were more impulsive . parts of their brain associated with emotion differed in size and activity to those with the high - expressing version . the study also found that activity of those parts of the brain in males with low - expression maoa differed more greatly than their female counterparts . weinberger and team say their work sheds light on the neural mechanisms involved in genetic predisposition to violence and it could help in finding ways to combat violence using biological approaches . but they emphasise the genetic contribution to violence is small . nature and nature schofield welcomes the new research saying it builds on the previous dunedin study by exploring how genes and environment can interact . " it ' s neither nurture nor nature , it is a complex mixture of both ," he says . schofield says the main weakness of the study is that it studied normal people and extrapolated what this might mean for violent people . he says the obvious next step would be to see if the results held true for a group of people who had a history of violent crime . but he says , if the emotional seat of the brain is involved , it suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy may be a useful tool to counter violent behaviour . neuroscientist professor lesley rogers of the university of new england in armidale also welcomes the study . " this expression of maoa form is really important in terms of how a brain will deal with a social situation , whether [ a person will ] go over the top or not ," says rogers , who has written extensively on the relationship between genes and environment . they be hers from being under at s should about should our because until because yourselves during then them if be his can just all has
