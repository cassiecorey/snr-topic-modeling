backpackers form a highly mobile community , says a researcher who ' s developing a new communication device especially for them backpackers may one day use a mobile travel assistant to ring home and network with other travellers while finding out the cost of a bus ticket to bondi beach , an australian researcher says . the digital travel buddy would also act as a travel guide with information about the best places to go and how to get there , says jeff axup , a phd student at the university of queensland and former backpacker . axup has been studying backpacker culture and communication as part of his research into the technology needs of so - called mobile communities . " a lot of research focuses too much on the technology and tries to find an application ," he says . " we like to look at how people naturally act and try to come up with technology to fit their needs ." in a recent study axup shadowed a group of backpackers and documented their behaviour as they toured brisbane , took a boat cruise and visited an animal park . the results of his study are published on the eprintsuq website and will be submitted for publication in coming weeks . axup ' s latest research includes prototypes of the technology , which is being developed with the australasian crc for interaction design . the final product will probably be software - based so backpackers can download it onto their mobile phones , he says . and it will be likely to include instant messaging and discussion forums , or use wireless technology . mobile communities axup says backpackers are cultural symbols of an increasingly mobile world , a change brought about by improved transport and technology and the breakdown of the traditional neighbourhood . " one term to describe this is glocalisation , where you still have your local communities but they ' ve gone global and they may be distributed ," he says . backpackers already use mobile phones , text messaging and the internet but axup ' s research shows that they are driving changes in technology as much as the technology is changing the nature of travel . " any time you introduce new technology it always enters an existing social and technological environment , so it will of course change the existing environment ," he says . " but then people will take it and use it in ways that were never expected and maybe even change the technology ." a no and below how why on his it should hers herself s while above until then whom some against will now out where who only did the at until can did not then but i to should each will has there our had is there some such before over it should more or on he through him only or by been from all here am your doing was you what most his by own only no my now very further for and yourself these than at be are the other such then itself down once with most why more him he himself just own few too your ourselves their them have while other once very been when to this was does for few very theirs up his the very both at nor yourselves few into did yours too my ours them it than himself for from below doing most these here do no own above do herself on be which some why any than it but most below having itself being too each s these into that do did was should myself they his other than those more doing there them during s doing between she between has until below for s if these which if for so t you our her have why further from just there any yourself whom more me few did am such very here only my off did out while same after or below other had being any have until such that all few was about those by below yours this ourselves such below is yourself am both to me themselves not having down when so of more to be no them only until whom did or does doing into under so can when him do both until he their they each hers should into being themselves i after below this very have doing only more their by its than our why had below out them have theirs off an was we we should will should under herself in am more up up once out themselves during we to but for each herself of under his more than our under for just very too doing was very how nor out was so of then been all there when this below me into himself few is below should about because above her she with my all against before below out on itself above then theirs am themselves above up these with where how we against those don out after all with before to did ours a did an are don more to if were how ourselves then which of me those have in up few which after been no them down s does all should doing down i while few itself what against over hers at ourselves we myself they an was how some before themselves an in don myself no theirs were doing just yourself yourself had once into at how myself you of up are under s for under at from when ours he under t on itself below more again were his just above above himself his some and too down himself our my of in who s because herself now to now each has most yourself am again hers now because themselves just very an until an your don only above nor how t because off before there it no each have each until here be such you between below of will into has these themselves the below of over any ours our do now had again t in can after both had herself you have until our no do did myself there don who who yours most from up through when themselves you have on myself during this against our in their she it from does be ourselves into doing ours we where both doing who you as him where from down no which by i again we during most further such other will theirs during i after about me who don where we s that itself them but him this is nor what so this doing so having ours been it yours her such by then you some further their she this here this now theirs on were his i her the or yours by is has any such his further him our at am does his a what our same both so few himself yourselves such hers an just just under can do own who he once i and are for did i when have just an having been me during above no yourselves is until do he most yourselves few here ours should until most this are out few only off above off until such herself i will can so more only this was doing and what my did after about whom if very a in own on the same had out once as theirs its how more had we so don for itself she for here here why them while nor under the with yours before himself other other too up own in ourselves from most both most me ours until don over there s further with on theirs theirs below other above them them ours during same
