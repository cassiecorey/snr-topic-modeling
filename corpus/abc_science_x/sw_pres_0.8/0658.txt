mercury will cross the face of the sun early thursday morning australian time , just like it did when this image was taken in 2003 australians are in a prime position to see mercury moving across the sun this week , an event they won ' t be able to see again for another 26 years . the transit , which can be seen using amateur telescopes on thursday morning australian time , is of particular interest to historians . astronomer dr nick lomb of sydney observatory says the transit of mercury in 1677 was the original astronomical event that triggered european colonisation of australia , and not the transit of venus , as commonly thought . " there is a very direct link between the transit of mercury and the fact that we are here and speak english in australia ," says lomb . on 7 november 1677 edmond halley witnessed a transit of mercury from the south atlantic island of st helena . lomb says this led him to suggest the idea that planetary transits could be used to work out the scale of the solar system , in particular how far the earth was from the sun . and this eventually led to james cook ' s voyage to tahiti to observe the transit of venus in 1769 , which in turn resulted in the british colonisation of australia . today , scientists use the transit of mercury and venus to study the chemical composition of the planets ' atmospheres . as a planet passes in front of the sun , scientists can use spectroscopy to deduce information about its atmosphere by comparing the difference in the electromagnetic spectrum given off by the sun and the planet . transits can also be used the study the momentary dimming of stars as a planet passes in front of it , a phenomenon used to detect planets circulating stars other than the sun . mercury transits the sun on average 13 times a century , says lomb , more frequently than venus , which only transits twice a century . transits of mercury occur in either may or november ( when mercury is closer to the sun ) and the next one will not occur until 2016 . the next transit visible from australia will not be until 2032 . just as there were other own more my any herself was than each having such by t from himself other be do further have can against do him this up same so
