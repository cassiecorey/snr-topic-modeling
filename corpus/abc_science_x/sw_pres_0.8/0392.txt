dvds coated with a light - sensitive protein may be able to store 50 terabytes ( about 50 , 000 gigabytes ) of data dvds coated with a layer of protein could one day hold so much information that storing data on your computer hard drive will be obsolete , says a us - based researcher . he says that the protein layer , made from tiny genetically altered microbe proteins , could allow dvds and other external devices to store terabytes of information . professor v renugopalakrishnan of the harvard medical school in boston reported his findings at the international conference on nanoscience and nanotechnology in brisbane this week . " what this will do eventually is eliminate the need for hard drive memory completely ," he says . renugopalakrishnan says high - capacity storage devices like the new protein - based dvds will be essential to the defence , medical and entertainment industries . these trade in terabytes of information with the transfer of information such as satellite images , imaging scans and movies . " you have a compelling need that is not going to be met with the existing magnetic storage technology ," he says . renugopalakrishnan says the new protein - based dvd will have advantages over current optical storage devices ( such as the blue - ray ). it will be able to store at least 20 times more than the blue - ray and eventually even up to 50 , 000 gigabytes ( about 50 terabytes ) of information , he says . the star at the centre of the high - capacity dvd is a light - activated protein found in the membrane of a salt marsh microbe halobacterium salinarum . the protein , called bacteriorhodopsin ( br ), captures and stores sunlight to convert it to chemical energy . when light shines on br , it is converted to a series of intermediate molecules each with a unique shape and colour before returning to its ' ground state '. the intermediates generally only last for hours or days . but renugopalakrishnan and colleagues modified the dna that produces br protein to produce an intermediate that lasts for more than several years , which paves the way for a binary system to store data . " the ground state could be the zero and any of the intermediates could be the one ," he says . the scientists also engineered the br protein to make its intermediates more stable at the high temperatures generated by storing terabytes of data . the flip side renugopalakrishnan says making large amounts of information so portable on high - capacity removable storage devices will make it easier for information to fall into the wrong hands . " unfortunately science can be used and abused . information can be stolen very quickly ," he says . " one has to have some safeguards there ." in conjunction with nec in japan , renugopalakrishnan ' s team has produced a prototype device and estimate a usb disk will be commercialised in 12 months and a dvd in 18 to 24 months . the work has been funded by a range of us military , government , academic institutions and commercial companies , as well as the european union . all how against after
