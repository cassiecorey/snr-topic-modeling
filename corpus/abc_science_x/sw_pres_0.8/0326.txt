researchers say that rock formations in the pilbara represent a diverse fossil ecosystem , but not everyone agrees researchers say they have found " compelling " new evidence of the earliest known forms of life on earth in ancient rock in australia . australian and canadian scientists say they have found new varieties of stromatolites , rock formations left 3 . 43 billion years ago in the pilbara region of western australia . if the researchers are right , and the stromatolites represent the fossilised remains of early microbes , this could cause scientists to revise estimates of when life began on earth ; some estimates are as recent as 1 . 9 billion years ago . the paper , published today in the journal nature , also fuels an ongoing controversy about whether the formations were made by living things or chemical processes . lead author , phd student abigail allwood from sydney ' s macquarie university , says the scientists found a stromatolite reef formed by microbial organisms . the reef , along a 10 kilometre part of the pilbara known as strelley pool chert ( stc ), contains new types of stromatolites , some looking like upside down icecream cones , others like egg cartons . " the astonishing thing is [ the reef ' s ] age , which is a time in earth ' s history when the very existence of life is uncertain ," she says . " we ' re seeing evidence not just of life ' s existence but that it was probably well established and already biodiverse , which suggests it could have emerged much earlier in earth ' s history ." but detractors say they ' re not convinced . martin brasier , professor of palaeobiology at the university of oxford , has long argued against the biogenesis theory of the stc stromatolites . and he isn ' t convinced by today ' s paper . " much caution is needed when making claims about the earliest signs of life ," he says . " in rocks of this great age we must assume the hypothesis of a non - biological origin ." seven new types the stc stromatolites were first discovered more than 20 years ago when they were declared to most likely be of biological origin . subsequent papers argued various alternative theories , including that they were formed by hydrothermal deposits that produced a mineral crust with structures mimicking stromatolites . today allwood reports she has found seven different types of stromatolite , potentially reflecting at least seven different types of organism . " stromatolites in the modern environment [ are ] associated with a whole community of organisms , so potentially we ' re talking about much more diversity than just seven types of organisms ," she says . but brasier argues that allwood and her team have demonstrated the " exact opposite " of biogenesis . he says if the structures had been made by living things they would have produced uniform , rather than varied , shapes . the wide range of stromatolites reported in nature indicates they are actually " self - organising structures of largely physico - chemical origin ", he says , like sand dunes or crystal formations . similar structures have been produced in the laboratory without microbes , he says . a window on the evolution of life allwood says her research sheds new light not only on when , but how , life began . she says the first stromatolites appeared as soon as the " carbonate platform " containing formations became submerged by rising sea levels . " it ' s like the organisms were literally waiting in the wings for the right conditions to emerge and they just pounced and spread rapidly everywhere ," she says . she says her results also contradict theories that early life emerged and flourished in extreme conditions . " what we ' ve found is that the hydrothermal activity occurs immediately stratigraphically below and above the stc ," she says . " the rise of the stromatolites occurs as the hydrothermal activity goes away and the fall of the stromatolites occurs when the hydrothermal activity comes back . " this certainly supports the notion ... of life getting a firm foothold and flourishing [ in association ] with something quite normal ." she says apart from the determination of the antiquity of life on earth being " an end in itself ", her research will help the search for signs of life on other planets , including mars . " these sorts of studies are crucial for informing techniques and approaches for detecting biosignatures on mars and how we ' ll distinguish them when we get there ," she says . under me has me their
