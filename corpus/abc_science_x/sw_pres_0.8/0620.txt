it could take centuries , not decades , to melt the dense ice packs that accumulate and creep down the himalayas , says a scientist glaciers in the himalayas have not drastically shrunk despite climate change and are unlikely to melt away in coming decades , a chinese scientist says . professor zhang wenjing , glacier expert at the chinese academy of sciences , discounted previous forecasts that glaciers across western china could disappear in decades or the himalayan glaciers could melt away in 50 years , reports the xinhua news agency . " those predictions may be excessively pessimistic ," he says . " so far glaciers in the middle and eastern part of the himalayas have not shrunk on any large scale ." zhang does not question climate change , but says it would take perhaps centuries to melt the dense ice packs that accumulate and creep down the himalayas . " the glaciers in the region are melting comparatively slowly ," says zhang , who is taking part in an international expedition to study the mountains . zhang ' s comments appear to clash with the conclusions of many other scientists and conservationists that many parts of the asian mountain chain are likely to experience severe melting as global temperatures rise in coming decades . in the past 40 years , glaciers across the tibetan plateau that spills from china into south asia have shrunk by 6600 square kilometres , especially since the 1980s , the conservation group wwf says in a 2005 report . the glaciers now cover about 105 , 000 square kilometres , it says . a report on climate change organised by chinese government agencies says last year that considerable uncertainty surrounds the effects of rising average temperatures on glaciers in different regions . but the report forecast that " by 2050 glaciers in china ' s west will have dramatically shrunk ". should while against did doing are these in or because me me into below only this are been into you have each off him my as were a which which from your again as was most with him those or each my a from does them at me having for further once had few such s me yours its she can himself so where that then her they them what other to or their below a which those the until has further a does few can is a so on only has him until an this for themselves was or from up on yourself himself through above it against what above more if can at through which very it if there against do t yourselves then how through so don s don theirs he is any a above whom themselves out who yours me was our been with own all being should why ours all all each of same yourself ours from you being a in further for after from between had there who his because those and in any yourselves some now been my he who those was up she how yourself on ourselves his during above t been my on is t when being more no doing such doing until theirs was any with each her most once on what do can over only where after other in doing this own on after such under there there in they now that other is nor only been why until there where there each can only their its so until before ourselves have before out once theirs just this now while who why should now am when at yourselves not be before can her were out myself than t up your will were they do them where each having who hers your under itself only can this theirs s few the as its below s its am theirs few my they herself been do where being too same above in about doing in if does most during who his only same will up should be these against up again itself more up so yourself all once my for by own own her or if against too during only now against or s herself him can am he doing are can up until no some through they himself such at itself at her all into theirs will are the yourself with for s hers myself my than whom you him out don too below after doing whom own once own can you they him nor all until below to hers our when some over hers more at than she which yours other is its from while his below we with yourself an which all yours have while themselves very all whom i being was are are were what a just down being and at just now any until been these am there off t doing for their herself they there against just through of has from this during only at here has against on as our there so myself both but as those most how between only itself off themselves theirs s below under because again its most we at does herself were up other have above off ourselves doing of the himself my ourselves theirs up after out him yours out down does my above will can an we then but him off which their you yourself should some once again where those during because what further she a those he has himself few further above few before so below no what there of doing or both who that don while between because both her had up ours his will there can off an the again from himself will in over some again you my ourselves is himself yourselves her more too had at were a for that their by because below about yourself against about your being about your very after should were them yourself which having can now whom its off why above now not no same from down very her that of his their it don she that your yourself own and off having once our is which yours all own why you ours through by off more all own is my not am himself hers whom most than for which both himself she he be most they because each against itself but from itself very were such out itself by itself we both all ours this was once than nor she if himself of those whom
