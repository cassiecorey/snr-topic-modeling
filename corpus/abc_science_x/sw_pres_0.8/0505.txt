archaeological evidence from ancient dung suggests that the people who lived here kept sheep or goats the discovery of a neolithic complex of caves in greece suggests not all cavemen were club - wielding , nomadic hunter - gatherers , but included some farmers and shepherds . they even had the stone age equivalent of a toolshed . evidence of such homebody cave dwellers comes from a recent excavation of a cave complex dating from 5300 - 3900 bc . the abode features plastered floors and evidence of crop - growing and an attached stable nearby . " this household was self - contained ," says dr panagiotis karkanas , who conducted the excavation of the kouveleiki caves , located on the cliffs of a shallow valley in the southern peloponnese . " i believe that the site was an ordinary household . the people were living there , cooking , sleeping , etc , probably during the whole year . they were both farmers and shepherds ," says karkanas , an archaeologist at the ephoreia of palaeoanthropology - speleology in athens . karkanas came to this conclusion after studying objects uncovered within the caves and after performing a detailed microanalysis of the cave sediments . findings will be published in the november issue of the journal of archaeological science . the complex consists of two caves , the first of which is divided into two chambers by several rock blocks that appear to have fallen from the roof before the caves were inhabited . the cavemen used this natural divide to their advantage , since one of the fallen rocks was curved and straightened to resemble a wall , which created a corridor between the two chambers . burnt manure found in the front chamber suggests a few animals , probably sheep and goats , were housed there . karkanas says the animals were probably " milkers or very young ". cereal husks and residue found within the dung indicates the cave dwellers probably farmed the land in front of the caves . he points out that farming in greece started at about 6500 bc , at the beginning of the neolithic era , or the new stone age . in the first cave he found fine painted pottery , polished axes , spindle whirls , clay and marble figurines , grinders and a collection of obsidian , chert and quartz tools . the dark , back ' room ', measuring about 150 square metres , appears to have been the main area of habitation . evidence for hearth fires was found . and the floor was plastered with a mixture of burnt dung and red clay . karkanas suggests this type of plaster was unusual for the time , though it became popular later , and is still used today . " plaster made of dung , sometimes burnt , and clay is common today in some villages in africa and india ," he says . he says the second cave " was probably used as a complementary activity area ", sort of the prehistoric version of a tool shed . nine human burials discovered within the caves suggests some people may have lived their entire lives at the site . moving to the caves curtis runnels , professor of archaeology at boston university , says he finds karkanas ' paper to be " both informative and convincing ". " the move to caves came for many reason , among which was the reorganisation of the economy during this period to emphasise sheep and goat herding ," he says . " part of the change was a focus on the production of wool and hair for textiles , which were traded for imported materials , possibly exotic flint or obsidian ." runnels thinks people who wanted to practice both farming and herding moved to caves in the somewhat remote , agriculturally marginal regions . then , as the new find suggests , they settled down . them on were there why we why was only
