" some of the money was spent in contacting the russia mafia as we tried to clone mammoths ," hwang told the court during a hearing this week . " but you can ' t say that [ on the expense claim ] so we expensed it as money for cows for experiment ." hwang previously said he obtained mammoth tissues from glaciers and tried to clone them three times but failed . prosecutors have charged hwang with fraud to secure funds and misusing us $ 2 . 9 million in state funds and private donations as well as violating bioethics laws in procuring human eggs for research . an investigation panel at seoul national university , where hwang once worked , said his team fabricated key data in the two papers on embryonic stem cells that were once heralded . misuse of state funds carries a penalty of up to 10 years in jail , while violating the bioethics laws can lead to three years ' imprisonment , prosecutors say . hwang denied any of the funds were used for anything other than research . he described extra expenses incurred when trying to secure animal ovaries in addition to paying for junior researchers ' housing and travel .
