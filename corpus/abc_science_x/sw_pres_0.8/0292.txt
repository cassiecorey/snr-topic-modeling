glowing plasma inside a fusion test reactor physicists say they have cracked a problem facing nuclear fusion , touted as the cheap , safe , clean and almost limitless energy source of the future . the us researchers say they have found a way to cut down erosion of the metal reactor wall , which would be a crucial step to improving efficiency . they publish their work online today in the journal nature physics . in fusion , atomic nuclei are fused together to release energy , as opposed to fission , the technique used for nuclear power and atomic bombs , where nuclei are split . in a fusion reactor , particles are rammed together to form the charged gas plasma , contained inside a doughnut - shaped chamber called a tokamak , by powerful magnetic coils . a consortium of countries signed a deal last year to build the international thermonuclear experimental reactor ( iter ) in southern france as a testbed for an eventual commercial design . but many experts have been shaking their heads at the many challenges facing the iter designers . one challenge has been the phenomenon of edge localised modes , or elms , sudden fluxes or eddies in the outer edge of the plasma that erode the reaction chamber ' s inner wall . the tokamak ' s inner wall is an expensive metal skin that absorbs neutrons emitted from the plasma . and erosion would mean that the wall would have to be replaced more often . eroded particles also have a big impact on the plasma performance , diminishing the amount of energy it can deliver . a team led by todd evans of general atomics , california , believes that the problematic elms can be cleverly controlled . the scientists found that a small resonant magnetic field , derived from special coils located inside a reactor vessel , creates ' chaotic ' magnetic interference on the plasma edge , which stops the fluxes from forming . the experiments were conducted at the general atomics ' diii - d national fusion facility , a tokamak in san diego . nuclear fusion is the same process used by the sun to radiate energy . in the case of our star , hydrogen atoms are forced together to produce helium . on earth , the fusion would take place in a reactor fuelled by two istopes of hydrogen , deuterium and tritium , with helium as the waste product . deuterium is present in seawater , which would make it a virtually limitless resource . tritium would be derived from irradiating the plentiful element lithium in the fusion vessel . the us $ 12 . 8 billion ( a $ 21 . 6 billion ) iter scheme entails building the largest tokamak in the world at cadarache , near the southern french city of marseille . the partners are the european union , the us , japan , russia , china , india and south korea . it is designed to be a testbed of fusion technologies , with a construction period of about 10 years and an operational lifespan of 20 years . if iter works , a prototype commercial reactor would be built , and if that works , fusion technology would be rolled out across the world . other problems facing fusion technology include the challenge of creating a self - sustaining plasma and efficiently containing the plasma so that charged particles do not leak out . in existing tokamaks , no one has achieved a self - sustaining fusion event for longer than about five seconds , and at the cost of using up far more energy than is yielded . a huge jolt of heat of nearly 100 million & deg ; c is needed to kick - start the process , which then has to be sustained by tiny amounts of fuel pellets . into she has of only or then or
