scientists hope they have a new way of tackling hiv / aids a bit like a trojan horse . they ' ve engineered a ' faulty ' version of hiv , infused it into the body and watched as it replicated harmless versions of itself an aids virus genetically engineered to fight other aids viruses has worked better than expected , suppressing the virus and renewing the immune systems of a few patients , researchers report . the study involved just five people but the surprising results offer new hope both for the field of gene therapy and for treating the fatal and incurable aids virus . but such an approach needs years more study , the researchers caution . " the goal of this phase i trial was safety and feasibility and the results established that ," says dr carl june of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine , who led the study . " but the results also hint at something much more ," he adds . " it seemed to have a vaccine - like effect in that the immune system was better in most of the patients than when they enrolled . we are trying to study the mechanism ." hiv infects close to 40 million people worldwide and has killed 25 million . a cocktail of drugs can help control infection , but there is no cure and no vaccine . the drugs can cause severe side - effects in some patients and the virus can evolve resistance , so that patients have to move to new drug combinations . gene therapy is a promising but troubled field of research based on the premise that altering genes can cure disease . it has cured only a few patients , and some have developed leukaemia as a consequence . one gene therapy volunteer died in 1999 . june ' s team tried a new gene therapy approach , first crippling the hiv virus , they report today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . " the virus is gutted so that it only has half the size of the original or pathogenic virus ," june says . antisense approach the so - called envelope gene remains , and is reversed , a manipulation called antisense . the researchers then recruited five patients with hiv who were beginning to fail treatment . their drugs no longer worked and the virus was beginning to damage their immune systems . june ' s team removed the immune cells , cd4 t - cells , that hiv attacks . the researchers infected the cd4 cells in the lab with their newly engineered antisense hiv virus , then infused them back onto the patients . when hiv or any other virus infects a cell , it injects its own genetic material into the cell . the cell is turned into a virus factory , sometimes pumping out thousands of copies of a virus before it explodes . after the new antisense virus was infused , newly infected cells pumped out defective virus , june says . " the virus particles that are released are , like , sterile . they are nonpathogenic ," june says . safety first this test was meant only to show that the approach was safe , and three years later , none of the patients show ill effects . the treatment appears to have helped restore the immune systems of four of the five patients , and the virus remains partly suppressed . " we put back more [ cd4 cells ] than we took out . we don ' t know if that is why their immune system gets better , because there are more soldiers , or whether it got better because of better antiviral effects ," june says . the therapy is being developed by gaithersburg , maryland - based virxsys corp and the studies are partly paid for by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases . phase ii trials are under way in hiv patients who have disease well - controlled by drugs . june says it is not yet clear if the treatment could work only in infected patients , or might even be used as a preventive vaccine some day . any up with does where were during themselves themselves over with ourselves when ours few the those are until was were during between our been your do
