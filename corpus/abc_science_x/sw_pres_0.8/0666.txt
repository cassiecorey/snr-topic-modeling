the solar flare was hundreds of thousands times more powerful than this one , a typical solar flare from our sun seen in 2005 . the ii pegasi flare was too distant to image in detail the most colossal x - ray flare ever detected has been caught in the act of zapping its solar system with planet - killing radiation . the star is ii pegasi in the constellation pegasus , about 135 light - years from earth . that means the explosive flare seen by the nasa swift satellite , designed to detect much more distant and powerful gamma - ray bursts , took place around the year 1871 . light from the event is only now reaching earth . the x - ray flare is the first - ever detected beyond our own sun that bears a striking resemblance to the much smaller ' x - class ' flares generated occasionally by our own sun . " it ' s a hundred thousand times more powerful than the largest solar flares ever recorded ," says astronomer dr steven drake of nasa ' s goddard space flight center . despite being far more powerful , it looks like it was created in the same way , he says . it starts with a tangle of magnetic field lines on the surface of a star that short - circuits . when that happens , atomic particles are accelerated to speeds only seen on earth in high - tech particle accelerators . the accelerated particles can emit gamma rays , which is what caught the swift satellite ' s attention in the first place . when the satellite turned to face ii pegasi , it took aim with its x - ray detector and caught the hour - long eruption of x - rays . violent eruption the x - rays were created as material violently erupted from the star and then arched back down and slammed back onto its surface . by comparison , x - ray flares on the sun last only second or minutes , at most . " it ' s certainly one of the biggest ever seen ," says drake about the ii pegasi flare . it ' s the hands - down winner in terms of those seen in ' soft ' x - rays , which are the rays just beyond the wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light . drake is a co - author on a paper on the flare that is being presented by the university of maryland ' s dr rachel osten at a meeting in pasadena this week . flaming star what ' s less surprising about the flare , however , is that it originated from ii pegasi , says pennsylvania state university astrophysicist professor eric feigelson . " it ' s known to be one of the most flaring stars ," says feigelson . if he had been asked to guess which nearby stars were capable of belting out such a flare , ii pegasi would have been among his top 10 , he says . despite being a middle - aged star that ought to be past this sort of wild and violent behaviour , ii pegasi is part of a tightly - bound two - star system in which the stars are roaring around each other , generating powerful tidal forces that keep ii pegasi riled up . fortunately our own sun is relatively quiet and stable , with x - ray flares that are unable to penetrate earth ' s atmosphere . is below doing them all whom this has you am from at once as when below has that same each some he a am while what has only if having having own above myself you other than into
