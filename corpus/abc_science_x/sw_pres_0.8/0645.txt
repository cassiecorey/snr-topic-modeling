nasa is discussing whether a shuttle mission to repair the hubble space telescope is worth the risk after all the time , money , anguish and work to return the space shuttle fleet to flight , the us space agency still has one lingering question to resolve . can a shuttle mission be sent to save hubble ? if not for the 2003 columbia disaster , the fifth servicing call to the hubble space telescope probably would have happened by now . that mission would have left the 16 - year - old observatory with fresh batteries , replacement gyroscopes for steering and two new science instruments . such upgrades could keep hubble on the cutting edge of astronomical research , delving into questions such as the nature of the mysterious dark energy that seems to be driving the universe ' s expansion and what the universe looked like as its earliest structures emerged after the big bang . but after the columbia accident shuttle flights that do not go to the space station , where astronauts can seek shelter in case their ship is too damaged to fly home , were considered too risky and the hubble house call was cancelled . nasa looked into a robotic servicing mission instead , but found the cost and complexity of such a mission too daunting . meanwhile , public outrage over nasa ' s decision to let the popular space telescope fester , culminating in a pledge by the new head of nasa to re - consider flying one last flight to hubble . now , with three post - columbia flights complete , the time has come to decide hubble ' s fate . nasa is considering if the safety upgrades implemented after the accident offset the risk of flying with few options available to save a stranded shuttle crew . " hubble is definitely sort of the comeback kid , so hopefully it will be able to do it one more time ," says professor adam riess , an astronomer with the space telescope science institute in baltimore . " i would expect that this is the final meeting ," he adds . " now it ' s a matter of coming up a with a decision ." shuttle program workers have certainly done their homework . the first order of business was to fix problems with debris falling off the ship ' s fuel tank during launch . a chunk of insulating foam broke off columbia ' s tank during lift - off and smashed a hole in the wing ' s heat shield . as the shuttle attempted to return to earth 16 days later , superheated atmospheric gases blasted into the breach , destroying the shuttle and killing the seven astronaut crew . nasa ' s first tank redesign , tested during a july 2005 flight of shuttle discovery , failed to prevent dangerously large pieces of foam from falling off the tank . a second redesign was tested a year later , and this time the tank was deemed safe enough to resume flights . the shuttle program also demonstrated how the ship ' s robot arm and newly added extension boom could be used during flight to scrutinise the shuttle ' s heat shield for damages . astronauts also tested using the boom as a work platform in case repairs were needed to fix heat shield holes before attempting atmospheric re - entry . finally , engineers developed rudimental heat shield repair kits and techniques . but there is no getting around the issue of flying without an orbital safe . hubble ' s orbit is too far from the station for a shuttle to get there . theoretically , nasa could severely cut shuttle power and keep a crew in orbit for several weeks until another shuttle could be launched on a rescue mission . but there is no guarantee the flight could be launched on time or that another problem might not also strike the rescue ship . " you just don ' t have the orbital lifetime on a hubble mission to be able to get another vehicle launched ," says deputy shuttle program manager john shannon . " we ' re going to have to go into the hubble decision not counting on the launch - on - need vehicle ," he says . " that ' s the difficult question the agency ' s going to have . do we have enough confidence in the [ tank ] design ? do we have enough confidence in our inspection and repair to be able to do that ? i think that ' s where the discussion is mostly going to lie ." another issue is whether to risk a shuttle and crew on a hubble flight when nasa is under a strict deadline to finish the space station before 2010 when the shuttles are to be retired . the agency needs at least 14 more construction missions and wants two additional flights beyond that to deliver heavy equipment and spare parts to the outpost . in a recently released flight schedule , agency managers set aside a hubble servicing mission for april 2008 . station assembly , which resumed with last month ' s flight of shuttle atlantis , would be complete in july 2010 under the new manifest . without a servicing mission , astronomers expect hubble to last only another two or three years before its batteries give out . even before then , the finicky gyroscopes could break or the cameras could fail . " it would really be a blow ," says astronomer dr harry ferguson , also with the space telescope science institute . " i think everyone is really quite hopeful that [ a repair mission ] will happen . we ' re waiting with bated breath ." if it gets upgrades , hubble should last until at least 2013 . that means it could still be operational when its sharp - eyed infrared replacement , the james webb space telescope , arrives in orbit to begin its five - year mission . the webb observatory , which is not designed for servicing by astronauts , is scheduled for launch in june 2013 . then who himself she who only further then too being with nor ours to she yourselves of my in been we off under nor should
