this owlet nightjar is one of the species found in the ' lost world ' of west papua , a world where animals show no fear of humans the lost world largely untouched by humans that was recently unearthed on west papua may be the last such find on earth , an expedition scientist says . his comments follow the discovery of a world teeming with new species , giant flowers and rare wildlife showing no fear of humans . australian , us and indonesian scientists , led by conservation international ( ci ), say they found the 300 , 000 - hectare paradise in the foja mountains of the indonesian - controlled province during an expedition late last year . the local kwerba and papasena people , who are customary landowners of the forest , acted as guides and naturalists . " the first bird i saw when i got out of the helicopter turned out to be a new species of honeyeater ," says team member kris helgen . the bird was an orange - faced honeyeater , a bird with a bright orange face - patch . helgen , who is completing a phd under dr tim flannery of the south australian museum , says the honeyeater is the first new species of bird found in new guinea since 1940 . " seeing that as the first bird was the clue that we were onto something big ," he says . the team also captured the first photos of the male berlepsch ' s six - wired bird of paradise ( parotia berlepschi ) in its natural habitat . this bird was one of a number first collected in the late 19th century by indigenous hunters and sent to victorian england where it was described as being of " unknown location ". several subsequent expeditions failed to find the bird . " it ' s definitely an area of great biological novelty ," says helgen . " there are lots of things found in these mountains that are found nowhere else ." the team took the first photos of the golden - fronted bowerbird ( amblyornis flavifrons ) displaying at its bower , a tower of twigs and other forest materials it builds for the mating ritual . the bowerbird , like the bird of paradise , had been collected in victorian times but no one knew where it came from . in 1979 , university of california ' s , professor jared diamond was the first to demonstrate that the foja mountains was the true homeland of the bowerbird . a lost world helgen says while diamond made observations of a number of birds in the foja mountains , he did not collect data or specimens . " we were the first to mount the true scientific expedition ," he says . helgen says , apart from the reports from diamond , there is no evidence that humans have ever been to the mountain range . even the locals who took part in this latest research had never been there . the researchers say the area is probably a 15 or 20 day walk from the nearest village . " not only are there no people but there are no things that people bring with them : rats , dogs , pigs ," says helgen , adding these animals affect native fauna . " it is a world that ' s been lost elsewhere ," he says . " much of the world would have looked like that at some point . " what ' s so interesting and unique is that it might be last time this is ever done : high adventure , true exploration of a place where no one has set foot hardly ." animals without fear for people the team also found mammals that show no fear of humans . for example they were able to pick two long - beaked echidnas , a primitive egg - laying mammal , that had been hunted to near extinction elsewhere . " the animals there just don ' t know people because people have never lived here . that ' s a very , very rare thing in this day and age ," says helgen . the team also found a golden - mantled tree kangaroo ( dendrolagus pulcherrimus ), which had previously only been found on a single mountain in neighbouring papua new guinea . and they found new species of plants including the largest rhododendron flower on record , almost 15 centimetres across , more than 20 new frogs and four new butterflies . pretty impressive dr ken aplin , an evolutionary biologist who specialises in mammals of australia and new guinea , describes the find as " pretty impressive " and agrees the remoteness of the foja mountains explains why it is in such pristine condition . " people will generally hunt within a days travel of the village ," says aplin of csiro sustainable ecosystems , currently based at the kyoto university museum in japan . aplin says mountain ranges such as foja originally started life as a series of oceanic islands off to the north of new guinea , which over time , came closer and closer to the main central range and connected up in the past million years . " so they were evolving their own faunas prior to becoming part of new guinea ," he says . other ranges along the north coast the foja range would have evolved unique species too , he says , but their biodiversity would have been affected by humans , feral pigs and dogs . " in a global context it may well be unique or very nearly so , in being one of the last places that is not showing any impact at all of human activities ." the expedition was co - sponsored by the indonesian institute of science ( lipi ) and received funding from the swift foundation , the gordon and betty moore foundation , the national geographic society and the global environment project institute . too what which few itself further i more all again until don down by very it here yourselves then which once each until yourselves that how of myself should those in down the under what am
