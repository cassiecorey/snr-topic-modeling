triton , pictured here in the foreground , might have once belonged to a pair of passing planets neptune might have nabbed its giant moon triton from a pair of passing sister planets back when the solar system was young and when planets and their growing brood of satellites were angling for clear orbital slots around the sun , a new study says . dual systems like pluto and its large moon charon are not uncommon among objects in the kuiper belt region , located beyond neptune ' s orbit , astronomers say . about 10 % of the known objects in this region have partners . dr craig agnor , with the university of california at santa cruz , was sitting in a lecture about binary kuiper belt objects when he had the idea that neptune may have kidnapped its main moon triton from such a pair . triton stands out among all the large moons in the solar system because it orbits neptune in a direction opposite to the planet ' s rotation , a so - called retrograde orbit . most scientists explain the moon ' s odd orbit and inclination by some variation of a capture scenario , a collision between objects , for example . but agnor had long been troubled by details that did not fit with any of the interpretations . " it ' s been this old problem to work on ," agnor says . " the existing answers , there was something just a little unsettling about them ." thinking in twos agnor and university of maryland astronomer dr douglas hamilton report in today ' s issue of the journal nature that they used a binary system rather than a solitary object to generate a computer model of how the relationship started . and they say this solved many of the theories ' flaws . the most troubling conundrum was accounting for the tremendous amount of speed triton must have shed to leave itself vulnerable to neptune ' s gravitational embrace . the collision theory , for example , would have required an impact so powerful that triton itself should have been destroyed . scientists also have suggested that neptune once had an extended gaseous atmosphere , which could have gradually slowed triton until it fell into orbit around neptune . but neptune seemed to have evolved slowly and probably never had much more atmosphere than it has today , says french astronomer dr alessandro morbidelli from the c & ocirc ; te d ' azur observatory in a related nature article . ripping off a moon agnor and hamilton show that if neptune chanced upon a pair of mini - planets , similar to the pluto - charon system , the encounter could have ripped one from its partner . computer models show that the object closer to neptune , which in this case would have been triton , would have lost enough velocity in the process to fall into orbit around its abductor . the partner object would have probably been buffeted by neptune ' s gravity , passed along to uranus and then saturn until it finally reached giant jupiter and was booted out of the solar system altogether , agnor says . the researchers are now curious to see if other eccentric moons in the solar system have similar life stories . through about a over on at about yours or don has most more through and t just they into before who its what no whom why before an now an ourselves now out it during did be while some
