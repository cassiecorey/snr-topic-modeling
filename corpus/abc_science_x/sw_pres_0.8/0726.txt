neanderthal foot bones in a block of cemented sand and clay from the el sidr√≥n cave in spain neanderthals had different ethnic groups , often starved and probably practised cannibalism . that ' s the news from a recent study of the skeletal remains from eight neanderthals who lived 43 , 000 years ago in northwest spain . the findings , published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , raise questions about neanderthal lifestyle . why , for instance , would they have resorted to cannibalism ? what harsh conditions caused the wear and tear evident on surviving bones ? there are two possible reasons why neanderthals would have dined on their dead , according to lead author dr antonio rosas , a scientist in the palaeobiology department at the national museum of natural sciences in madrid . " one is that they needed to eat whatever was at hand , including human flesh , because ecological conditions for their survivorship , such as extreme cold weather and no meat from hunting , were really hard ," rosas says . the other possibility , he says , is that " this was done in the context of something we may think of as symbolic ". rosas suggests the virtual absence of animal remains at the site , a cave called el sidr & oacute ; n , may point either to ritual killings or unsuccessful hunting . neanderthals are thought to have subsisted primarily on meat . toothy clues the neanderthals studied ranged in age from infancy to young adulthood . their teeth revealed that tooth growth often stopped abruptly due to illness or malnutrition . adolescence in general appears to have been a particularly hard time , possibly due to separation from parents and the resulting need for self - sufficiency . cut marks associated with butchery were found on some of the remains , particularly those of the younger individuals . the skeletal remains also reveal that these neanderthals possess a different bone structure than individuals found elsewhere in europe . it appears that neanderthals fell into at least two basic ethnic groups that coincided with their north - south geographical distribution . southern neanderthals from the iberian peninsula , the balkans , the middle east and italy had broader and shorter faces than northern neanderthals from populations living north of the pyrenees , the alps , portions of asia and central and eastern europe , the researchers say . scientists are now debating whether interbreeding with modern humans occurred and why all of these neanderthal groups appear to have gone extinct . " it does look , from a variety of data , that neanderthals were subject to episodes of extreme scarcity , with which their cultural and social systems sometimes couldn ' t cope ," says professor steven kuhn , an anthropologist at the university of arizona . " there could also be a link between boom - and - bust subsistence and occasional cannibalism ." sharing out the chores kuhn and colleague professor mary stiner theorise that modern humans better divided labour along the lines of gender and age . instead of everyone working toward the next big kill , women and children in early modern human groups devised other food - obtaining strategies , such as gathering fruits and nuts . such diversification underlies our success , even today , they say . " it is clear that the kinds of cooperative , diversified economies practised by recent hunter gatherers are ' underwritten by ' our sophisticated cognitive and communicative abilities ," says kuhn . " that ' s what allows people to negotiate and maintain their complex patterns of dependency and cooperation , keep each other in line , etc . but whether the cognitive development is cause or consequence isn ' t clear to us ." if they each is them were your own in into t did into which through yours just am they ours been before about they most me during as just which myself through theirs
