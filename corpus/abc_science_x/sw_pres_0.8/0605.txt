anti - north korea protesters chant slogans at a protest denouncing both the north ' s nuclear device test , which scientists now say looks like a dud more than two days after north korea claimed to have exploded a nuclear weapon , scientists edged towards the conclusion that the test , if indeed nuclear , was a failure . but a failure is unlikely to derail north korea ' s nuclear program and could even help pyongyang ' s bomb makers , they warn . two main sources of scientific evidence are needed to confirm that a blast is nuclear . one is the shockwave sent back by ground detectors . the other is fallout , radioactive particles or gases , that often escape from an underground test site , even if the tunnel or shaft is sealed tight . but north korea ' s blast was so tiny that the seismic wave is almost indistinguishable from routine subterranean background noise , experts say . that means it will take a long time , harnessing supercomputers and the minds of top physicists , to find any telltale spikes that confirm the blast was nuclear , and not say a stockpile of tnt blown up as a hoax . " there is a series of differentiations to be done " to sift out the blast from background noise , says xavier clement for france ' s atomic energy commission . " it is possible that this cannot be done , given the weakness of the signals compared to the background noise ," he says . in the absence , so far , of any known radiological evidence , scientists also note the very small size of north korea ' s explosion . only russia has described the blast as a full - fledged nuclear event , equivalent to 5 - 15 kilotonnes of tnt . meanwhile the norwegian institute of seismology norsar describes it as a " medium - sized bomb " at 1 - 10 kilotonnes . but other national monitors put it at less than 1 kilotonne , with one figure as little as 200 tonnes . such low yields are feasible with a nuclear warhead , but they are traditionally reserved for established members of the nuclear club that have mastered arts of miniaturisation . " the easiest size of weapon to build is 10 - 20 kilotonnes . it ' s harder to build one that ' s smaller , and it ' s harder to build one that ' s larger ," says james acton of vertic , an independent uk watchdog that carries out research into the verification of international treaties . " it seems to me technically unlikely and politically unlikely that north korea would have tried to do anything other in its first test than in the 10 - 20 kilotonne range ," says acton , a cambridge - educated nuclear physicist . " if it was a nuclear test and the yield was less than a kilotonne , it seems to me the evidence is that this test was a fizzle , it was a partially unsuccessful test ." clement agrees . " if it turns out to have been a nuclear test , it ' s clear that the weakness of the energy release corresponds to an explosion that fell short of what could have been expected ," he says . if the test failed , what went wrong ? the assumption among experts is that north korea used plutonium rather than uranium to make its bomb , given the plutonium - making reactor and fuel rods known to be in its possession . uranium bombs , like little boy dropped on hiroshima in 1945 , are bombs that are relatively easy to make , in which a uranium slug is fired into a ball of uranium to achieve critical mass . but plutonium bombs are more complicated . they entail a small ball of plutonium that , like the centre of an onion , is swathed by conventional explosives . these explosives compress the plutonium and fire a neutron into the mass to initiate a chain reaction . but the explosives must be " very , very carefully shaped ", and the detonation must be precisely timed to ensure that the neutron is fired at the right time , says acton . another possibility , again , still in the realm of hypothesis , is that the material used in the test had impurities of plutonium isotopes that emit neutrons and this caused the chain reaction to start prematurely . whatever happened , " none of the problems are in any way terminally fatal to the program ", cautions acton . " they will almost certainly have gained information from this test which will have enabled them to build a better weapon next time around ." out were below me each with where yours was and now our
