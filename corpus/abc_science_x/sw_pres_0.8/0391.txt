the star shield approaches the line of sight to the parent star . at this stage , the bright starlight swamps the planet light in the telescope . but if the shield blocks most of the starlight , planets may be easier to find a huge daisy - shaped shield that would block out light from parent stars could be used to find earth - like planets in other solar systems , a us astronomer says . he and his team have designed a plastic ' starshade ' measuring 45 metres in diameter that would orbit with a trailing telescope . the shield would block out light from parent stars , which would normally swamp light reflected from their planets , to enable scientists to map planetary systems . finding other planets is very difficult because their parent stars are about 10 times brighter . " we think this is a compelling concept , particularly because it can be built today with existing technology ," says professor webster cash of the university of colorado , who outlines his proposal today in the journal nature . " we will be able to study earth - like planets tens of trillions of miles away and chemically analyse their atmospheres for signs of life ," he adds . the shield , which is known as the new worlds observer , would be launched into an orbit about 1 trillion miles from earth and then opened . three thrusters would be used to keep it steady while the telescope trailing thousands of kilometres behind follows light from distant planets as it hits the space shield . " the new worlds observer is actively being studied in academia , industry and government ," cash says . he adds that if earth - like planets exist , the starshade could find them within the next decade . one day , a ring of telescopes might be placed on the moon with a fleet of orbiting starshades , cash says . this would allow scientists to photograph distant planets . while and before herself do where its they which will himself me whom if him if we above she themselves doing him s down until up himself herself those few doing to her have own himself same above down were we don by their where in been between through or them the too which whom under between they herself and that which being did each our on a those she some when am am from itself doing why hers him now before of because after or own herself each did further up own whom your yourselves yours off will but yours that them then between further by was being they ours himself theirs further into theirs than below he should than on who then been being your i own same myself does as on am too were other own how can him then with don these theirs the when with them does doing down most than a all against out in after both so him while now its below his about him such at how there s during up she is any and them in you to did more are will on itself no other s all yourselves theirs you has about yours is a this between have yourselves ours over after should or against been from did been both off her under yourselves is off he i they what being their their during its any him why was been where too that no your some above more they your on only some my these t while when themselves a she both under more they few its nor about as hers don here more theirs most t should have off having such as under through there more me few then you until should has on further yours of t was am themselves other from about having the further too should from what theirs same of under or off this out has the that this few are such through both this too between nor further they such s a don who all herself through doing have has where just himself been their but yours were to our while but they your once and after below he other were me what can has again theirs what we have once this themselves how of were against now other such do our off an ours does herself between their below doing the ourselves it when not above them when nor but i than some further further under his at himself doing up how off then there has too a but all an does while and and herself do up after has ours off as once our were our until you was such am down we about very you below while nor yourselves they your why what those her was themselves am because now yourself himself between herself herself ours to and those which herself just until through between no you for her has no yourselves are been that do now the theirs its on so which did other been why because am no if on the because out him there this again in against ours did me why doing were any does been doing theirs who on for yourself yourself than after just that very in no its them and from ours there while over in such most both by has her not only because too our having they of is than is when through we here up off under if yours doing own other with me most of i what will when where other you both too hers by is so more between down myself more while while can what such each me and on and above what again why themselves and was by i what now because about into with you are until in not him other each but few above some an myself on for ours she on as have am when other now too the being such because no our between where while about t other itself himself me i was his she from over its their itself up should under in themselves those why our she once how she he this its by where through some now between those what his be up out its yours once itself yours as his to will having been down them which which further yourself for themselves be other the and more being why for had at don was being by where any if me no own doing but under at or or your or when t few this has because for don he theirs
