the red wine molecule seems to mimic the benefits of eating less without the effort of dieting . but will it work in humans ? a compound in red wine and grapes can extend the life span of obese mice and help them enjoy a healthier old age , scientists say . the molecule known as resveratrol not only enabled the mice to live longer than other overweight rodents , it also reduced the negative health effects of eating a high - calorie diet . resveratrol has been shown to have same effect in studies on yeast , flies and worms . but the scientists say their research is the first to show it works in mammals . " it is possible to find a molecule that activates the body ' s natural defences against ageing . you can use it to enhance the health of a mouse or mammal . that is unprecedented ," says associate professor david sinclair , of harvard medical school . he adds that the study , reported online today in the journal nature , is proof of the principle that it works in mammals . but the real test will be to develop formulations or find other molecules to treat age - related illnesses such as diabetes , alzheimer ' s , heart disease and cancer in humans . researchers already know that restricting calories can prolong life in mice and other organisms . resveratrol seems to mimic the beneficial effects of eating less without the hassle of dieting . middle - aged mice sinclair and an international team of scientists , including australian researchers from the university of sydney , analysed the impact of the molecule by studying three groups of middle - aged mice . one group ate a standard diet , the second a high - calorie diet and the third had the same diet but were given supplements of resveratrol . eight weeks after starting the study , the scientists noticed a difference between the two high - calorie groups . by the time the mice were 114 weeks old , 58 % in the high - calorie group had died , compared to 42 % in the other groups . " after six months , resveratrol essentially prevented most of the negative effects of the high - calorie diet in mice ," says dr rafael de cabo , a co - author of the study from the us national institute on aging . the study is continuing but so far the compound has extended the life span in the high - calorie mice by about 10 - 20 %. " there is no question that we are seeing increased longevity ," says sinclair . in addition to increasing survival , the compound reduced the negative effects of being obese so the mice treated with resveratrol lived as long as the lean mice . they had healthier heart and liver tissue , decreased blood sugar levels , better insulin sensitivity and were more active than the other rodents . which genes are involved ? when the scientists looked at the genetic level , to see which genes in the mice were switched on or off , they found the molecule had changed the gene expression pattern of the obese mice towards that of lean mice . the next step is to understand how the compound works . sinclair and his colleagues believe a key component could be the sirt1 gene , which is thought to be linked to life span extension . sirtris pharmaceuticals , a therapeutics company co - founded by sinclair , has started a trial of a proprietary formulation of resveratrol in patients with type 2 diabetes . " the real bang will be if somebody proves this is going to work in people ," sinclair adds . hers then just against our him during itself its or herself all very at or its in when i very they been
