in less than 50 years , fish markets like this one in india may not have any produce to sell the world ' s fish and seafood populations will collapse by 2048 if current trends in habitat destruction and overfishing continue , resulting in less food for humans , researchers say . when they analysed scientific data going back to the 1960s and historical records over a thousand years , they found that marine biodiversity - the variety of ocean fish , shellfish , birds , plants and micro - organisms - had declined dramatically . some 29 % of species were already in collapse . extending this pattern into the future , the scientists calculate that by 2048 all species would be in collapse , which the researchers defined as having catches decline 90 % from the maximum catch . this applies to all species , from mussels and clams to tuna and swordfish , says assistant professor boris worm , lead author of the study , which is published today in the journal science . ocean mammals , including seals , killer whales and dolphins , are also affected . " whether we looked at tide pools or studies over the entire world ' s ocean , we saw the same picture emerging ," says worm , from dalhousie university in halifax , nova scotia . " in losing species we lose the productivity and stability of entire ecosystems . i was shocked and disturbed by how consistent these trends are , beyond anything we suspected ." when ocean species collapse , it makes the ocean itself weaker and less able to recover from shocks like global climate change , worm says . the decline in marine biodiversity is largely due to overfishing and destruction of habitat , says worm . over - exploitation the loss of biodiversity makes ocean ecosystems less able to recover from the effects of global climate change , pollution and over - exploitation , worm says . he likens a diverse ocean environment to a diversified investment portfolio . with lots of different species in the oceans , just as with lots of different kinds of investments , " you spread the risk around ", worm says . " in the ocean ecosystem , we ' re losing a lot of the species in our stock portfolio , and by that we ' re losing productivity and stability . by losing stability , we ' re losing the ability of the system to self - repair ." to help depleted areas rebuild , marine - life reserves and no - fishing zones need to be set up , the authors say . with marine reserves in place , fishing near the reserves can improve as much as four - fold , worm says . beyond the economic benefits to coastal communities where fishing is a critical industry , there are environmental benefits to rebuilding marine biodiversity , the scientists say . depleted coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to invasive species , disease outbreaks , coastal flooding and noxious algae blooms , they report . certain kinds of aquaculture , like the traditional chinese cultivation of carp using vegetable waste , can also be beneficial , according to the scientists . but farms that aim to raise carnivorous fish are less effective . was being theirs than does are whom the so t but herself as i with so just of out just are then theirs for both why where then our such been all below over more and but own will into
