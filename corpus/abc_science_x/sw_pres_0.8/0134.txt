this exoplanet is 13 times the mass of earth and is shown here with a hypothetical moon a cold , heavy ' super - earth ' has been found orbiting a distant star , using a method that holds promise for detecting faraway planets that closely resemble our own , astronomers say . the planet weighs 13 times as much as earth and is orbiting a star about 9000 light - years away . but instead of circling close to its star , as earth does , this super - earth is about as distant from its star as jupiter and saturn are from the sun . an international team of scientists says the new planet probably has a temperature of minus 201 & deg ; c , making it one of the coldest planets detected outside our solar system . the discovery is billed as a super - earth because it is thought to be a rocky , terrestrial planet like earth , even though it is much more massive . the planet was detected by astronomers using a project called ogle , short for optical gravitational lensing experiment , which looks for changes in light coming from distant stars . if another star passes between the faraway star and a telescope on earth , the gravity of the intervening star acts like a lens and magnifies the incoming light . when a planet is orbiting the closer star , the planet ' s gravity can add its own distinctive signature to the light . this phenomenon is known as gravitational microlensing , and it has the potential to detect less massive planets than other methods of searching for planets around other stars . lots of super - earths the ogle project detected the microlensing event in april ; a total of 36 astronomers working with ogle found the signs of a planet , 9000 light - years away in the direction of the milky way ' s central galactic bulge . a light - year is about 10 trillion kilometres , the distance light travels in a year . professor andrew gould of ohio state university who heads the planet - hunting group microfun , short for microlensing follow - up network , says this discovery has two implications . " first , this icy super - earth dominates the region around its star that in our solar system is populated by the gas - giant planets , jupiter and saturn ," gould says . " we ' ve never seen a system like this before , because we ' ve never had the means to find them . " and second these icy super - earths are pretty common . roughly 35 % of all stars have them ." the researchers report their find on arxiv , a website run by cornell university . in the past decade , scientists have detected some 170 so - called extrasolar planets , using a variety of techniques . the vast majority are gas giant planets like jupiter that are hostile to life as it is known on earth . in january , a planet about five - and - a - half times earth ' s mass circling a star near the center of the milky way was detected using gravitational microlensing . in he should at as nor very
