so , tell me about yourself ... if you go out on a first date with someone and they only tell you good things about themselves it ' s not because they ' re being dishonest . they ' ve genuinely repressed their bad points , a memory conference has heard . celia harris , an australian phd student at the university of new south wales , has demonstrated that when we ' re courting a romantic partner we are likely to remember only the good things about ourselves while forgetting the bad . harris asked 86 male and female subjects to imagine they were going on a date and to list 10 positive and 10 negative things that they would recount about themselves . " we asked them to think , you ' re going out with this person you ' ve really liked for a long time , you want them to think you ' re funny , smart , clever , a nice person , so try and come up with things that would impress them ," she says . positives included getting on well with their mothers , having lots of friends and helping elderly ladies carry bags . negatives included getting falling - down drunk , failing exams or getting into fights . accentuate the positive , eliminate the negative after completing a series of tasks and undergoing a brief distraction period they were asked to recall all the negative and positive points about themselves . while the participants remembered all the positives , they struggled to remember all the negatives . harris says her study demonstrates our uncanny ability to selectively forget certain things if we have a motivation , such as impressing a new love interest . " it confirms that motivation drives what we remember and forget ," she says . " it supports the idea that there are selective phases of autobiographical memory [ and ] depending on the situation we ' ll facilitate certain memories for retrieval and inhibit or block the retrieval of others ." her study is reported in a poster presentation at the 4th international conference on memory held in sydney this week . choosing what to remember harris based her study on retrieval - induced forgetting , which says that repeated recall of certain items can impede our ability to remember others . participants were split into two groups , with one required to concentrate on five negative points in their list and the other asked to concentrate on five positive points . while the positive group remembered all their positive memories , the negative group forgot half the negative . this demonstrates that positive memories seem to be protected against retrieval induced forgetting , harris says . hers other did too after she these do very and yours itself do these is at
