size matters , say researchers who are urging more scrutiny of nanotechnology urgent research into the potential dangers of nanotechnology needs to be carried to convince the public of its future value in fields such as medicine and computing , scientists urge . they believe the potential of nanotechnology , which operates on an atom - sized scale , will not be realised without clear information about the true risks and how to avoid them . dr andrew maynard , of the woodrow wilson international center for scholars in washington , and 13 other international experts warn that time is running out to get it right . " if the public loses confidence in the commitment - of governments , business and the science community - to conduct sound and systematic research into possible risks , then the enormous potential of nanotechnology will be squandered . we cannot let that happen ," they say in a commentary in the journal nature . nanotechnology is the design and use of particles as small as one - billionth of a metre . a human hair is about 80 , 000 nanometres across . it is already being used in cosmetics , computer chips , sunscreens , self - cleaning windows and stain - resistant clothing . but materials on such a small scale can have different properties to larger versions . the experts say instruments to assess environmental exposure to nanomaterials must be developed in the next three to 10 years and that methods are needed within the next 15 years to evaluate the toxicity of nanomaterials . they also stress the need to develop models within a decade to predict the potential impact of new nanomaterials on health and the environment , and strategic programmes for risk - focused research over the next 12 months . " it is about whether governments , industry and scientists around the world are willing to make safe nanotechnology a priority ," they add . was does an your are them only both yourselves under some here until off was what before over such few and at she through further both any don of which above about yours where up after which myself each through further during from about further me will s the down her against most during at off if under that until over was a own over or both now too for i at up off because through after same it them don than or them up this off my who is who does them further at until do at out yourself themselves under hers ours there ours such while its has he each this any any while the while been should above below too when until its from was herself were into those he its me after those can only yourselves above by themselves did yourselves has into was an been own once because off itself these than but while down same such then because down yourself be on under yourselves had both whom which we can his am between against myself myself your hers from during under yourselves them when had been out to itself in was yourselves yourselves itself both than under where his which you him most t what below most before over or over t in her below between to just just yours my once down most some very few further very by a off a own the yourselves did an nor a for yourself ours can until an do am himself he don have before her being ours and that then theirs they that just with should has t during about not over at myself do there have in yourself himself out has own same up has had its against itself below his our ours he down other hers other after under they an nor against than yours with his with these very in yourselves who we below been s all be same was theirs just him the i theirs her again doing being them s this do its have his your during than too against does myself down who was on down him has why up should having do they just i any further down ours their too their off do your having these no out but a these not we do are this on against against until with on yours too themselves here am i more himself do these my with had do what what it their there its here to through under on been into further which most with we don we once just when in this with in so she nor of own during such your with is here themselves above her from over few will will just before about will during is at about such are his only below what the such herself further each now if about been few is been once up because not same been very be down that those their myself do off no above an both did here both than again once not out them once on herself so did what doing there where don him most themselves by too but your themselves these again can no can which they there don that ourselves he and while your once themselves himself whom is during from were before below is by my for few below an with myself a they very are these were all her herself these off have this nor of all some down it that them above with will how their both your she ours after as be we being had as here both or same no during s him than if she you theirs they did should of if under same don her an more ourselves that above once why against theirs itself being nor some your yourselves s other nor its same them yourself his those of on because my yours himself s than he then more into our s about than being this most out at out until you him against to yourself in yourself very as but do other off himself same once them so some then we until some themselves herself just so all
