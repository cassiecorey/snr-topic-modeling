light behaves in weird ways when you shine it through special materials light does something weird when you shift it into reverse , scientists say . it moves faster than the speed of light . two research teams independently reported the counter - intuitive behaviour , observed in two very different experiments , in a recent issue of the journal science . " this is just so mind - boggling that it cries out for attention ," says professor robert boyd , an optics expert at the university of rochester in new york . he and his colleagues triggered the odd trick using optical fibre laced with the element erbium , the same kind of fibre used in telecommunications . they split a burst of laser light , sending one beam through the optical fibre and allowing the other to travel without interference . oddly enough , the first beam ' s peak exited the far end of the fibre way ahead of the peak of the comparison pulse . odder still , the exiting peak escaped even before the original peak had entered the fibre . what had happened was that as soon as the leading edge of the original pulse entered the fibre , the fibre instantly cloned an identical pulse at the far end . that cloned peak exited before the rest of the original had been introduced . at the same time , another cloned pulse fired backward through the fibre to cancel out the original . so ultimately , one pulse entered and one emerged , but with timing that appeared to violate light ' s natural speed limit . to test if the pulse was travelling backward as it seemed , the team shortened the fibre a few centimetres at a time and repeated the experiment . by adding the experiments together in sequence , they watched the beam ' s backward progression . the fibre itself , they conclude , instantly reconstructed the pulse at the far end , simultaneously sending another pulse backward . not once , but twice german researchers made a similar observation in an independent experiment at the universit & auml ; t karlsruhe . a team led by gunnar dolling sent a pulse of light through material whose unusual properties allow it to bend light in unexpected ways . dolling and colleagues also witnessed the very same backward , faster - than - light behaviour as the rochester team . " the propagation of [ light ] waves through dispersive media often leads to surprising or counterintuitive behaviour ," report dolling and colleagues , referring to dispersion as the ability of a material to separate light into different wavelengths , or colours . these and other experiments with weird light are suddenly possible because of new light - dispersive materials , more sensitive technology to detect what light is doing , and because optics researchers are simply paying more attention to the strange things light does in odd materials . " up until several years ago people were not familiar with the concepts of slow and fast light ," says boyd . about doing only while for their should being some that in where a was they that while
