bacteria remove gold from soil and deposit it on grains where they live , scientists say australian scientists have found the strongest evidence so far that bacteria play a key role in forming gold grains and nuggets . they have found bacteria that remove gold from the soil and deposit pure grains of it around them . researcher dr frank reith from the crc for landscape environments and mineral exploration , and colleagues gathered their evidence at two separate mines and publish their results today in the journal science . at the tomakin mine on the south coast of new south wales and the hit or miss mine in tropical north queensland , most gold is hidden away in quartz veins , in amounts that are invisible even to high - powered microscopes . but the soil above the mines also contains grains and nuggets of gold that have somehow found their way out of the quartz . " there are a probably a lot of processes involved ," reith says . he and other scientists have long suspected that bacteria play a part , but it ' s an idea that has generated some scepticism . to test the theory , reith sifted the soil above the mines and collected gold grains 0 . l - 2 . 5 millimetres across , and then subjected them to several experiments . first , reith looked at the grains under a high - powered electron microscope to confirm that they contained bacteria - shaped bubbles of gold . " they ' re little lumps on the surface ," reith says . next , he looked for organic matter on the grains , as evidence that bacteria had been growing on their surfaces . finally , he used a technique called polymerase chain reaction to look for bacterial dna on the surfaces of the grains to show that living bacteria are still there . " the dna would have degraded if the bacteria weren ' t around any more ," reith says . about 80 % of the grains had living bacteria on them , reith says . and the only bug that was found on all those positive samples was ralstonia metallidurans . " these grains come from areas that are almost at the opposite ends of australia ," reith notes . " we were pretty happy with that ." reith thinks the ralstonia bacteria play an important role in the microbial ecosystem in soil , helping to rid it of the soluble gold that most other species find toxic . " this is the guy whose job it is to get the toxic gold out of the environment so the other bacteria can live a happy life ," he says . in the future , the gold - loving bugs could prove a boon to industry , reith says . perhaps they could be used to improve gold processing , or even be useful as a marker for the presence of gold that ' s otherwise invisible . who can our until from as be why
