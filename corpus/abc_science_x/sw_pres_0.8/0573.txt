downloading information to your mobile phone may be a case of pointing it at a building and clicking one day you ' ll be able to point your mobile phone at a train station , click and download a timetable , or point it at a museum to download a list of exhibits , researchers say . that ' s the idea behind dr federico casalegno ' s electronic lens or elens project at the massachusetts institute of technology . you could also use the phone to contribute to conversation threads , similar to those on internet forums , about a particular business or institution . for example , you could submit or retrieve a movie review at a movie theatre . " it ' s a layer of electronic information on physical places ," says casalegno , a research scientist at mit as well as a user - experience manager at motorola . the approach could change both how institutions deliver information to the public and how people interact with public and private businesses in their neighbourhood . casalegno ' s idea for the project began with the metaphor of an electronic lens that , when aimed at a building , could become a kind of viewfinder , making the institution more transparent . the technology consists of three parts : a barcode - like tag that is placed on places of interest , software called radioactive that is installed on the mobile phone and the social networking website constellation . to use the system , someone would first stick the tag on a building . for example , the manager of a movie theatre could stick the tag on the outside of the building , then take a picture of it with a mobile phone . next , the manager would launch the radioactive program , which would ask him or her to name the tag and provide its location . the software automatically locates the tag on a map . then , the manager can create a message that contains text , audio , pictures or video . there could be a tag for each movie playing in the theatre , with each tag hosting a movie trailer with show times . viewers with the same software on their phone can access the tag and start a conversation thread with movie reviews . the manager can also use the constellation social networking website to give certain groups access to the tags . perhaps there is a promotional discount for students of a particular university . more than movies the technology could work for more than movies . people could place their own tags around town to open up public dialogues about parks or city schools . they could even use the tags inside a building , such as a hospital , to provide information to select groups , such as doctors , nurses or visitors . " it ' s very convincing , this idea of connecting social networks with the mobile community ," says leda guidi , head of the citizens ' communication unit for the city of bologna , italy , who organised the country ' s first free municipal internet network . not only does it open up more channels of communication , says guidi , it could make commerce and government more accessible . casalegno has already conducted a user study of 20 people in spain and is now working on a new version of elens to be tested by next year with 100 participants in boston or chicago . this could mean that soon , pointing and clicking will not be limited to the laptop . him was had which to have doing now having them yourself they once when only for theirs how any t himself is having doing down
