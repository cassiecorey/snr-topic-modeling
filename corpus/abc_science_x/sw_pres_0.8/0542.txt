computer - generated image of tres - 2 as seen from the night side , with its host star in the distance astronomers using a tiny amateur - class telescope and off - the - shelf camera lenses have found a jupiter - sized planet orbiting a star 500 light - years from earth . the planet , called tres - 2 , is the first to be found in this particular field of view , known as the kepler field . the discovery is the second for a network called the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey , or tres , which taps small telescopes in california , arizona and the canary islands to hunt for planets outside our solar system . the team looks for planets that pass in front of their parent stars , relative to the view from earth . as the planets transit , they slightly dim the total amount of visible light that radiates from the star , as seen from earth . by observing the star over a period of weeks or months , astronomers can detect if there are any objects that temporarily and regularly block a bit of sunlight . " it ' s really difficult to make these measurements ," says francis o ' donovan , a graduate student at the california institute of technology and the lead author of a paper slated to appear in the astrophysical journal . tres - 2 is a gas giant , similar to jupiter but somewhat bigger and more massive . but unlike jupiter , tres - 2 is very close to its parent star and very hot . the planet dims its parent star ' s light by only 1 . 5 % as it passes around every 2 . 5 days . the astronomers also had to rule out other possible explanations for the dimming , such as a partner star gravitationally locked in orbit with the target star , called gsc 03549 - 02811 and located in the constellation draco . finally after months of work , the observation was confirmed by a large 10 metre telescope at the keck observatory in hawaii . " all our hard work was made worthwhile when we saw the results ," o ' donovan says , who hopes to parlay his discovery into a doctorate degree in astronomy . o ' donovan ' s goal is to find earth - sized planets beyond our solar system , but for that he will need much more powerful telescopes . he may return to the tres discovery in the future . the planet is the first found in the kepler field , a part of the sky that will be the sole target of a nasa telescope slated for launch in 2008 . the kepler space telescope is designed to find earth - like planets in orbits that favour the development of life . the tres network involves the sleuth telescope at caltech ' s palomar observatory in san diego county , the planet search survey telescope at lowell observatory near flagstaff , arizona , and the stellar astrophysics and research on exoplanets ( stare ) telescope in the canary islands . a new larger telescope , funded by the discovery channel , is under development at lowell that will also be used for hunting extrasolar planets . our no i too for herself having such but with again have your to out be over we herself such am here below me between your while both am than
