simulation of small satellite galaxies orbiting and falling into a larger one astronomers have released new evidence to show that a region of stars in our galaxy known as the arcturus stream is the digested remains of what was once a neighbouring galaxy . the evidence is among the first to come from the largest star study to date , with data from 25 , 000 stars just released at a us astrophysics workshop . dr quentin parker of sydney ' s macquarie university and the anglo - australian observatory is head of data management at the international radial velocity experiment , or rave , which uses australia ' s uk schmidt telescope . parker says the latest results provide a smoking gun for the argument that the milky way is a voracious cannibal that devours its neighbours . " we ' ve confirmed the arcturus moving group as being a star stream , which indicates a disruptive galaxy spiralled into our own ," he says . " ours is a large galaxy and it has been eating other galaxies ; it ' s been hungry . we can see what it ' s eaten by the crumbs that are left over from its meal ." it ' s another bit of evidence for the now widely accepted cannibal , or accretion , theory of galactic evolution , parker says . according to this theory , the gravitational pull of large galaxies sucks in smaller ones , making large galaxies like our own a sort of cosmic melting pot . parker says the rave measurements show stars in the arcturus group are travelling at a similar velocity and in a similar direction through space , indicating they were once part of a coherent system . " using ... star velocities it ' s possible for the first time begin to unravel the way our galaxy is constructed ," he says . the rave study is measuring the speed of a million stars in the milky way using radial velocity , or the motion of a star along the line of sight between the telescope and the star . the huge scope of the survey has been made possible by the six degree field ( 6df ) spectrograph on the 1 . 2 metre uk schmidt telescope at the anglo - australian observatory , which can obtain spectroscopic information for up to 150 stars at once . the telescope splits light from the stars into a wide spectrum of colours and by looking at specific colours produced by calcium atoms astronomers can work out whether the colours have ' shifted ' in the spectrum . this enables them to work out aspects of the star ' s movement . " we ' re looking at the stars in our galaxy and measuring their velocity by measuring how their lines have shifted ," parker says . the survey has so far collected information about 90 , 000 stars and will release data on the remaining 65 , 000 as it ' s analysed . if until being just both is whom during having he each will has from their we its more were very in what here that between both
