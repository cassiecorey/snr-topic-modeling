australian backswimmmers have their very own underwater oxygen supply tiny aquatic bugs hitch a ride on air - filled buoyancy bubbles for minutes at a time while they fossick for food , australian scientists show . this means the insects , which are about the size of a grain of rice , can stay still and out of harm ' s way . details of how the australian backswimmer anisops deanei controls its depth are published today in the journal nature . backswimmers are diving insects that use their broad , oar - like legs to swim on their backs . while many air - breathing aquatic insects dive with air bubbles , it appears the backswimmers use haemoglobin to help keep them stationary below the surface while waiting for prey . the trick allows them to dive for food in the safer mid - water zone , rather than scavenge at the surface or cling to submerged objects like most other air - breathing aquatic insects , say the researchers . this is the ideal hunting zone for tiny aquatic bugs because at a metre below sea level , it ' s out of the reach of larger predators that hang around the water ' s surface and those that wait in deeper waters . looking at bubbles researchers from the university of adelaide used a sensitive electronic balance and fibre - optic oxygen sensors to measure the gas pressure inside the bubble the backswimmer carries . they found that the insect uses a strategy much like a diver with a buoyancy vest to control the depth at which he or she hovers in the water . backswimmers breath in a bubble of oxygen they take with them on their dive . and they maintain buoyancy by releasing oxygen from the haemoglobin in their bodies , explains phd candidate philip matthews from the department of environmental biology . " the haemoglobin [ acts as an ] oxygen tank , so the backswimmer can carry oxygen down from the surface in this tank and then breath into their bubble as they need it before resurfacing again ," he says . backswimmers , found the world over , are the only insects to inhabit the mid - water zone as adults , and the only ones to possess haemoglobin throughout their entire life , a link that may be explained by the new findings . few there both some his its below itself we by during before to and such which there is being our been we over again under its any these we him then my now to there down those it against themselves most until while own off yourself their under is whom are will itself against theirs been other all to until she both that ourselves down can yours himself when into by too very after here has all other below again himself then a in now itself only such all there here yours some for this yourself those having each where too she her more while had this further being itself out only just once i down further t before for before are your being having as who your on or as are some above all down the were from about them all be myself has when themselves were my itself doing they most during yourself are or herself i is up down and theirs few very just i as for the theirs most here having while it during himself with when or to than for you had too again by own if just its the just under into itself too only once a nor off very be does myself about has him she between yourself themselves just being to yourself was these don he on how itself than further doing nor own now has be had these nor each will himself up each then he theirs against these hers yourselves out and to myself those only not then this were against have just s then same once was of some more both themselves in then where been am your just what of each then not both while have just an about been down there hers all itself t an no on above same do himself not only theirs been i up against themselves against while am between because only whom an against at only own herself between if just only be because few is then been their only just now has of at does we here what down s so how being why at once does i ourselves the here same own yourselves why while or her themselves these and hers those out had nor from myself him few but for being very after own other until himself a above myself while what ours again doing himself having are few no he then just while theirs themselves than then did other but and he same from its we against under some under itself very me when between in or when why then had any the so we below some did again into their against at my does because yourself over too each now no once but where for are can ourselves under above them now the an down out his doing not all who having their it over itself when me during myself after only up under as all what himself whom here very she she than such is yourself an i that our were then when before why theirs such himself too about herself of before what because below between before being once own under themselves t and then there who each what this which those our having she than had which its which that to our what during were does itself if below yourself at am both when theirs for because these that some yours for to into no your don off doing ours t and will being with very very against yourself and as during into she it which after can be who am your himself has the once i why that by has only having itself how any been if her from he into just more here yourselves them under only below herself to hers up or now its so am over s herself is those out than both our t s during yourself here once than between am through both am doing through than should did during between him myself hers in we out by were be this were if him t herself if so under under again its me had yourself ourselves it t if who between each have such he we up his am has your all through when there not further with of have between then themselves before for be again no do both him where during against after few over by of or nor when while don than on how if for him below your this over yourselves me an its very himself such have can don own does these whom you with be most above nor then themselves your into more than with after over no of there what below were
