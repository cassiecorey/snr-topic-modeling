the ability to plan for the future has been around for at least 14 million years , scientists say , when the apes shared a common ancestor apes plan for the future , according to new research that questions whether humans are the only animals to think ahead . german research published today in the journal science says apes can choose an appropriate tool to reach a treat and save the tool for the future instead of using it immediately . the researchers , from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology , say that planning for future , not just current , needs is one of the most formidable human cognitive achievements . this is because it imposes a long delay between performing an action and being rewarded for it . the researchers let bonobo chimpanzees and orangutans select tools to reach grapes and juice bottles . they chose appropriate tools half of the time , took them to their sleeping rooms then used them up to 14 hours later when retrieving the treats . both species show the skill , the researchers say , suggesting it evolved at least 14 million years ago , when all great ape species shared a common ancestor . " our results suggest that future planning is not a uniquely human ability , contradicting the notion that it emerged in hominids only within the past 2 . 5 to 1 . 6 million years ," they write . first evidence of its kind associate professor thomas suddendorf , a psychologist from australia ' s university of queensland , says this is the first published evidence that apes save tools for future use . suddendorf , who comments on the study in the same issue of science , says the findings also give a glimpse of our evolutionary past and provide a starting point from which researchers can begin to reconstruct the evolution of the human mind . " the fact that such simple performance of great apes is exciting reminds us how special and precious our foresight really is . it is so common that we take it for granted ," he says . but he says there is no evidence yet that apes can anticipate a future mental state . for example , there is no evidence they can anticipate being thirsty when they ' re not currently thirsty . how about other animals ? scrub jays , birds found in the americas , are animals that also plan for the future , the scientists say . these birds move their food around to decrease the chance of it being stolen . suddendorp says some species that appear to be planning for the futures , say by building nests or hoarding food , are actually using instinctive behaviour or associative learning . them there been
