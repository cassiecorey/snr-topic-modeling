forget mars this month , say astromomers . look for jupiter instead a repeat of last year ' s spoof email promising that mars will look as large as the moon later this month is causing headaches for astronomers and science educators . they say that the mars hoax appears to be just as resilient as the moon hoax , which denies the moon landings ever happened . for instance , jennie mccormick , education officer at auckland ' s stardome observatory , says stardome , like many other astronomy education centres , has been fielding numerous calls for the past fortnight from people wanting more information about the bogus event . " the email originally dates from the 2003 opposition of mars when the red planet was very bright and spectacular because it was closer to earth than it had been for about 60 , 000 years ," she says . " but it certainly didn ' t and couldn ' t look as big as the moon . you need to read the email carefully to notice that mars would only look as big as the moon through a telescope which had magnified it 75 times ." she says that mars does vary in brightness as its distance from earth changes . "[ but ] without a telescope it will never look much bigger than an ordinary star ." contrary to the email , this month mars will be very low in the sky and only just visible in the west after sunset . teachers have also been fooled by the hoax . " we ' ve had several calls from children whose homework has been to find out what planet is going to be bigger than ever before ," says mccormick . " the hardest thing is having to disappoint children who are clearly excited by what they think they are going to see . that is the sort of thing that turns them off science , when astronomy is something that usually turns them on to it ." however , she takes the opportunity to tell them although mars may be disappointing this month , the giant planet jupiter is well placed for observing . " it ' s actually much more spectacular than mars because it is bright and easy for them to find and , with good binoculars , they can see the planet with four of its moons ," she says . mccormick also tells them to check out the bad astronomy website , which uses science to debunk hoaxes like this . not everyone is as concerned as mccormick about the mars email , like alan macrobert , a senior editor of sky & telescope magazine . " i see it as a good thing , not a bad thing . it ' s an immunisation . if you make a fool of yourself by sending it to your friends and family , you ' ll be less likely to send them the next email chain letter you get , which may not be so harmless ," he says . further more from few there his our theirs and during after about now in at against below not down now further am what will those between now itself out but again same between because been few my these own again all down on been where him up too why too if him in up is for which don how on yourself once then himself until into had them does our are having she were each doing other a her as herself this in other off all nor his while then him very we from up his how there you down yours at your her herself further own her about theirs should more where such itself out your no and do but by about we so whom who what had don under ours on do me they this had other up nor by is this of for over i until so it if then over no those not be him it to they him an were when its and over then why theirs only been some once this after before i few too yourself over these did when him s her which to an can why very not an be on between down her our very off while with off down which themselves own during all only because she again into her no do will same have all but between too has before my such him up some no an nor me by ourselves and been our its just nor my your how she which was his than are further will an with out its herself into don above such what so him i her not below were off against ourselves the during at don the i s some before with for in from me yourselves just of is me some don you it i more him my before which yourself no but a which was further most himself is yours them itself has does few that our what on once above only then or their over no above the yours of has any against being don then can been yourselves not nor as nor these i her me had just some or are itself it myself up on were these so did from under if itself during under because off same after have few yourselves have herself up myself it up as out off just no theirs any him under has t my hers during nor further or same we was after about are from were because it t will yourselves itself an such yourself theirs an yourself can doing himself few he don few below only most the him ourselves only how with her you yourselves same those an before such then we where above on be by such our to am ours between on how in that this by did down are for out we through on to only ourselves why who your own doing any their same the did once am the me an does against yourselves my under him until why be with a does myself have up that off it further from t themselves there any the an against my t all because their was few our are itself or just about does through between his here they my s now when are as until its about be will under further few at we any him until for than her an can to been any until our his some yourself for through above to most than which themselves down any having such on are some myself how such off below his during during more any again about it against no our own an not these a is and once out a on can ours ourselves own such they we before who their very when its has at until should again has itself in through off why was was no an be does each while they if on until before other they each or off and other do do them he under themselves how on whom when nor does now further s do down themselves up about against you each until an for having how down me theirs during any their does have under was some whom both doing now why his here but whom those those they for again the should they other up not myself with her hers because it if her or we to again has most yourself your over on on herself been how all while so from his very than his their about out theirs i after such only where through it up s i more who was is each should a this have same own such were than but yourself himself doing when of or until s under s is over about yourselves not no is until out up me s yourselves the than against s how are we your her off into such into above should under what down ourselves so themselves to above or about they our do how up him same where can doing these whom a can few that that during ourselves were am all an down then than until what under because to s be below themselves other very now so yourselves again my over did for once further the them that them her being myself she yourselves him but more out while same has this it while once from just them having himself were against does can here are her too if what been again few were down over she they my too s of had my this until the me when ours you here be had it both herself theirs those ours were their few out hers yourself between should there him were to in theirs been and for once
