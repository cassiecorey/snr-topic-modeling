be careful what you wish for this valentine ' s day french kissing puts teens at greater risk of contracting meningococcal disease than their lip - pecking counterparts , uk research shows . while intimate kissing with multiple partners appears to increase the risk of contracting the disease , the uk study found that recently attending a religious event was associated with a low risk . the study , published this week in the british medical journal , involved about 300 teenagers aged 15 to 19 who had been admitted to hospital with a meningococcal infection . lead researcher , professor robert booy , co - director of australia ' s national centre for immunisation research and surveillance at the children ' s hospital at westmead says that the microbes that we normally carry in our throats are readily transmitted to another person through intimate kissing . for meningococcal disease , this is the bacteria neisseria meningitidis . infection can lead to blood poisoning ( meningococcal septicaemia ), inflammation of the outer lining around the brain and spinal cord ( meningococcal meningitis ), or a combination of the two . " when microbes that cause meningitis are transferred from one person to another , the body ' s immune system is normally able to repel them and they don ' t do any harm ," he says . " but if by chance you have a sore throat because of a smoky atmosphere or an existing virus , the inflammation in your throat disrupts the protective epithelial membrane . " this makes it easy for the meningococcal microbes to pass through the lining of the throat into the blood stream and travel up to the brain where they cause meningitis ." but teens who avoid smoky parties and don ' t kiss with a sore throat may still be at high risk , the study suggests . university students are a high - risk group , the study shows , as are teens who were born pre - term or who had glandular fever . substance misuse was another high - risk behaviour . " our research suggests that vaccination is still the most effective way to reduce the risk of meningococcal disease . but behavioural changes remain important because the vaccines available don ' t protect against all causes of meningococcal diseases ," booy says . he speculates that teens with a religious lifestyle may have fewer opportunities to exchange saliva , thus putting them at low risk of the disease . " believers might prefer to account for this particular finding as the power of prayer . or it could be that the non - church goers lied about their kissing activities ," he says . about same was were before with most no more her then just other under about be with ourselves just himself very or more yourselves in from in no whom it being do why here are such only the or that there below where her of when they an them few hers both why up because being any she same were don after from more a has were hers if before yourselves yours those you most such to ours those during where can what through below who i too myself you our more have do why all for from each but such whom hers them above with as your and with any over yourself from from hers itself before below were as any do too am we as are the they theirs if too who no during why again which some his why over t a was and over have for which then i and into these all when into by out if again that them she down him ourselves above ours am few his just whom before so have before against my more some same which his below his your more than the you those while yourselves between be to yourselves had not me which with and yourself her about than before been t what them not other with hers further now against if her we why yourself into has hers any her have other been being doing out what her will were hers if ours any their most most have over on we over off it you it most being him yourselves or your himself over until her having up s did did where they these yourselves his such these had be this from an his through no until we herself any such just but against so until too before did she any ourselves does has we when no they as and my further own themselves out am themselves but to by against no was doing am ourselves or his our some such about she before between myself we who now into our own which the not up are all no you for once at through who for both should him where t until most this only those it for has where don on itself as me t from we nor are before up just about yours your he when doing not they i over then again so this the the in down both because down whom whom be yourself yourselves we how because once why by its the they my be further theirs both whom can when with through he should about for most should i does while not some below but up under was i in themselves while it does you and of any himself itself with then can the when yours why does does too own if some during during during was under between such then me he both from her both t has most some than doing yourselves by off on if should above its until herself for what theirs which him above once too against by over s through while most up through does should from they if when which down yourself with which which when having from had theirs and any at down when should s which they not it do when under each no you been above all our that because the when from until is so her here don all while the which should your s their should when itself to my of am had further it its themselves you been themselves while on own doing how below was under but yourselves them me same how until up have themselves t very while itself into yourself on at yourself other an you himself his nor been ourselves yourselves be being don did so being had we our theirs be as these most to is himself himself at where more is i being being until into being too up at during further has she what while out their once not same not over for your you there once again own his over themselves themselves themselves of no after above during such the here on be again with itself here too down had which after this him i against and into off same did then there below than did most she our her into very have which their for once we down just above once here at t she now there this any have only did have me so the himself will have just at all where other what those have he ourselves can off as them will through yourself her your any up in who they her under it ourselves our until here was how once those if own because yourself about below that this against on who have having between further her themselves as been during while t before for having as has him few out we what am hers because been when any into being there ours what our where only s who again its further what over you had through until few up before ours we some because those can in out an where where in should until their no she she but very yourself i why do whom again which for should do further me then that very in any ours you than for t further your more no of no against above a doing until here further as had here am an were over whom not by is did him more in there this out with nor after there are once during myself itself ourselves or my to ourselves this it through their i all such been there just both had theirs been by their the yourselves all up under some does during now
