seabirds , like this grey - headed albatross , can be caught as bycatch . but could a stinky repellent ward them off ? an old fishermen ' s remedy for preventing seabirds from becoming bycatch turns out to be true , according to a new study on the effectiveness of shark liver oil at warding off birds . using the stinky oil might help save seabirds , which often have fatal interactions with longline fisheries . these fisheries use a line up to 100 kilometres long , often with additional branching lines . each line is rigged with hundreds or even thousands of barbed , baited hooks . seabirds , including some endangered species , often dive for the bait and fish . the birds can become entangled in the lines or injured , sometimes fatally , by the hooks . alex aitken , a new zealand fisherman for over two decades , uses the traditional shark liver oil as a deterrent . sharks themselves are bycatch in the snapper longline fishing industry , but government and industry regulations monitor their numbers in new zealand . aitken drips the oil into water around fishing boats to deter the birds . in 2003 , he entered his concoction in the seo / birdlife international competition for bycatch reduction . he won . to test the oil , scientists johanna pierre of new zealand ' s department of conservation and wendy norden of wildlife conservation group audubon california conducted experiments off new zealand ' s north island . the seabird community there includes the endangered black petrel . the researchers dripped the shark liver oil from a plastic container at the stern of their vessel , while they set out 200 baited hooks on lines . as controls , they later conducted the same test using vegetable oil and seawater . the shark liver oil did not affect fish catches , but it did dramatically reduce the number of times seabirds dived for the hooks . for example , after nine minutes , only two or so birds went for the hooks when shark oil was present . around 40 birds dived when seawater was used , while more than 50 took dives during the vegetable oil trial . pierre and norden think the birds might even have been attracted to the vegetable oil , but the shark liver oil was a successful repellent . their findings are published in the july issue of the journal biological conservation . " we are not sure what happens when the seabirds smell the oil ," pierre says . " however , when the oil is released at the stern of the vessel , the effect ... is next to immediate . the birds disperse away from the vessel , sufficiently far that they can ' t be seen . one or two birds may come in from time to time and do wide looping flights around the vessel , but they typically don ' t land or stick around for long ." the repellent seems to have more to do with the noxious smell of the oil , or its consistency in the water , rather than the birds ' fear of sharks . " i think it ' s unlikely that they have a negative reaction to the smell of sharks per se . this is because the birds have no hesitation to eating shark livers when they are whole and they can also eat shark waste readily ," pierre explains . the deterrent only appears to work as long as the dripping is continuous . once the oil flow stops , pierre says the birds " somehow cue into the fact that the vessel area is now attractive / interesting , not oily / nasty ". though shark liver oil is a natural product , it may be problematic to introduce large amounts into marine environments . pierre and norden hope the effective ingredients in the oil may be identified and isolated . it could be that these ingredients may be found in products other than shark liver oil , but this has yet to be determined . in the meantime , the scientists suggest caution in using large amounts of the oil , and hope alternatives such as aerosol mists of the effective ingredients can be developed in the long run . have after some as have t this by as not should themselves below such above has through theirs down to himself theirs an he of who in i were of during very then been or here these into between
