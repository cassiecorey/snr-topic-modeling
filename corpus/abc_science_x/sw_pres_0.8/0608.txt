fiddler crabs with blue shells are vulnerable . so when hungry birds are around , they turn muddy brown tiny blue - shelled fiddler crabs change their colour to avoid being eaten by predatory birds , researchers have discovered . scientists have long been intrigued by the crabs ' ability to change the colour of their top shell from bright blue to a more subdued , muddy shade . but exactly why the crabs change their colour hasn ' t been clear . " when you catch them , for instance , they go dull ," says dr jochen zeil from the australian national university , whose research appears in the journal of experimental biology . to find an answer , zeil and his colleagues studied a particular species of fiddler crab , uca vomeris , on the mud flats of australia ' s northeast coast , south of townsville . " some populations of these crabs are all very dull , but in other places they are very colourful ," zeil says . " we wanted to understand how this happens ." the scientists looked at variations between crabs from three different areas : one group was dull coloured , another was colourful and a third group mixed . they found differences in the numbers of crab - eating birds near the dull coloured populations . " in the places where the crabs were colourful , there were few birds ," zeil says . " but in the others there were more birds actively hunting crabs ." to confirm these findings , the scientists set up an experimental model to test whether the crabs changed their shell colour in direct response to the threat of being eaten . they found two very colourful crabs living close together and set up a kind of wooden screen between them . one crab was left to go about its life as normal . but the other was subjected every couple of minutes to the attentions of a pretend bird . in reality , it was a small foam ball suspended on fishing wire . crabs have poor vision , so the approach of the black ball was enough to convince it a bird was coming , zeil says . within days , that crab had changed its colour to the muddy shade , while the other remained colourful . " we could observe that over a couple of days , the crabs did change their colour when they are confronted with this dummy bird ," the researcher says . scientists suspect the blue colour of the crabs is normally used to help them identify others living close by , and avoid fights , zeil says . the next step in his research will be to see whether staying dull all the time has any effect on neighbourly relations . yourself and from having doing i him were nor have does such its she those a as other my up our has when can was to which with other myself we will through off i after how
