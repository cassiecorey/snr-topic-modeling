japanese people traditionally eat eel on the hottest days of summer to combat the heat . seen here , restaurant owners inspecting their stock ahead of national eel day an ancient mystery surrounding the japanese eel , a species as prized by fishermen for its high price as it is by chefs for its delicate flesh , has been explained at last . like its atlantic cousins , the japanese eel ( anguilla japonica ) matures in freshwater but then migrates out to sea to spawn . but where this act is carried out has , until now , been an enigma . the answer , says a japanese ocean researcher today in the journal nature , lies in a tiny triangle of the pacific ocean about 2000 kilometres east of the philippines , near underwater mountains west of the mariana islands . there male and female eels gather in the waning moonlight in the middle of the year , luxuriating in the balmy tropical waters . university of tokyo scientist professor katsumi tsukamoto collected newly - hatched eels during a research trip aboard an oceanographic vessel , the hakuho maru , last year . the creatures were still in a microscopic larval state and could only be identified with a dna test . the scientist pinpointed their spawning site as 14 & deg ; north , 142 & deg ; east , to the west of the suruga seamount in the southern part of the west mariana ridge . the eels had hatched about four days before the new moon of june 2005 . just the spot the site is cleverly chosen , because it enables the hatchlings to be carried northwestward on the kuroshio current , which flows towards the coastline of china and japan where the eels mature in rivers and lakes . if the spawning were to occur only a little bit further south , the infant eels could get swept up in the mindanao current , which runs southwards down the eastern side of the philippine archipelago . the love grounds of the japanese eel are tiny when compared to those of its two atlantic relatives , the european and american eels ( a . anguilla ) and ( a . rostrata ), which reproduce in the sargasso sea in the eastern caribbean . grilled , steamed , grilled or baked , the eel is a delicacy in japan , where it is known as unagi . most eels sold for food come from aquaculture . but these eels come from wild eels that are caught and put in fish farms to mature in captivity . a surge in demand as a result of surging demand and disruption to its reproductive cycle , catches of this species have fallen by three - quarters in the past 30 years , according to the un food and agriculture organization . the price of japanese eel has soared over the past decade , prompting importers to turn to cheaper european eels to meet demand . in turn , this has encouraged dangerously unsustainable catches of european elvers , known as ' glass eels ' because they are transparent for the first few years of their life . same he does with a whom were your between than more at ours it both does can but here while these off if have her s
