characters from star trek had similar adventures to the heroes of ancient mythology star trek heralded real developments in science and drew on the great classical myths , an australian researcher says . dr djoymi baker , a self - confessed trekkie from the university of melbourne , watched more than 700 episodes of the cult tv series as part of her phd . baker , an expert in media and popular culture , says scientists often dismiss science fiction for getting it wrong . but she says it can foreshadow or even influence developments in science , adding that more members of the public watch science fiction than " science factual ". " because it ' s gone on for so many decades [ star trek has ] had a big impact on what people think about space and what might be possible in the future ," she says . " a lot of nasa astronauts cite it as their inspiration ; scientists have cited it as their inspiration for new technology ." for example , nasa ' s first shuttle of 1977 was named enterprise after a campaign by star trek fans . the star trek influence can also be seen in new ' spray on ' drug delivery technologies , the computer chip and even the flip - top mobile phone and automatic doors , she says . and after the catchphrase " beam me up scotty ", scientists have started to experiment with dematerialising and rematerialising helium , and ' cloning ' laser beams . " they can ' t beam you up yet but they ' re starting to do experiments along those lines ," baker says . while star trek described life in the future , it also had what is now regarded as a quaint pre - copernican tendency to place humans at the centre of the universe , she says . back to the future baker says star trek still holds a huge fascination even as space authorities like nasa fight for funds , recognition and good publicity . " scientists often don ' t like science fiction because it can get it wrong , but on the other hand it can be very inspirational ," she says . " nasa might be struggling [ but ] on the other hand we have science fiction which says we can achieve great things in space , not only in terms of exploration but in terms of what sort of race we want to be , and that ' s quite a powerful message ." baker says star trek not only looks forward to the technological future , but harks back to the heroic past of ancient myths like homer ' s odyssey . not only do mythical figures like the amazons , the god apollo or the sirens of homeric lore appear in space , but star trek contains the sweeping themes of intrepid adventure and bold exploration that lie at the heart of classical mythology . " mythology is a bit of a recurring theme in science fiction television shows ," baker says . " just as you might have met strange creatures in an ancient myth , instead you find strange creatures in outer space ." shows like star trek were also an indirect offshoot from the great cinematic " sword and sandal " epics of the 1950s and 60s , she says . " mostly tv was constrained by much tighter budgets so it just couldn ' t do those types of spectacles ," she says . " so myth goes into other genres and one of the genres ... is science fiction . " instead of going into the ancient past , you fast forward into the future ." about again had should himself himself over during so during and were it he before s not ours was this have am him no
