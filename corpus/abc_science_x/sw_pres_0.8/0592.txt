artist ' s impression of an ultra - short period planet circling its star astronomers have discovered a new class of planets outside the solar system that hug their parent stars so tightly they take less than a day to complete an orbit . using nasa ' s orbiting hubble telescope , astronomers found between eight and 16 new planets near the centre of the milky way that orbit their parent stars in as little as 10 hours . they were looking at part of the milky way known as the ' galactic bulge ', so - called because it is rich in stars and in the gas and dust that go to make up stars and planets . the scientists publish their findings today in the journal nature . at 26 , 000 light - years away , they are the most distant planets yet found and a further indicator others are probably scattered throughout the milky way , the researchers say . " this allows us to say with a high degree of confidence that there are billions of planets in our galaxy ," says dr mario livio , an astronomer at the space telescope science institute in baltimore . scientists have long conjectured that planets exist outside our solar system but they have only been able to locate them since 1993 . about 200 planets have been discovered so far , many of them gas giants similar to jupiter locked in a close orbit to their parent stars . those ' hot jupiters ' can be eight times closer to their parent stars than mercury is to the sun . the newly discovered planets fit within that category , except they move even more quickly around their parent stars , which are smaller than the sun . surface temperatures on those " ultra - short period planets " are about 1650 & deg ; c , says dr kailash sahu , a space telescope science institute astronomer who led the team . their parent stars are so nearby they fill up one - third of the sky from the horizon to the zenith , sahu says . sahu ' s team found the 16 possible planets by looking for stars that dim when planets pass in front of them . the researchers confirmed two of those as planets by examining the slight wobble of the parent star caused by the orbiting body ' s gravity . the other objects were too distant . using other tests , the team was able to say with certainty that " at least a large fraction of our candidates must be planets ", sahu says . what after how over only yourselves those with some yourself all some through above through been yourself some them as they does yours these
