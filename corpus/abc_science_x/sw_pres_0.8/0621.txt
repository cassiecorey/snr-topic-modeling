scientists have fired lasers at cells to make them vibrate , then picked up the characteristic sound of melanoma cells in the blood doctors looking to see if cancer has spread may be able to one day simply listen for it , us researchers report . researchers at the university of missouri - columbia say they have used a technique called photoacoustic detection to pick up the characteristic vibrations of melanoma cells in the blood . they say their method could let oncologists spot as few as 10 cancer cells in a blood sample , catching a tumour ' s spread before it can settle into another organ . writing in the october issue of the journal optics letters , the researchers say they combined laser techniques from the field of optics and ultrasound techniques from acoustics . they used a laser to make cells vibrate and then picked up the characteristic sound of melanoma cells . the researchers say they were able to detect melanoma cells obtained from actual patients . the dark , microscopic granules of melanin in the melanoma cancer cells absorb the energy bursts from the blue laser light . as the melanoma cells expand and contract , they generate crackling sounds that can be picked them up with special microphones and analysed by computer . other human cells do not contain pigments with the same colour as melanin , so the melanin signature is easy to tell apart from other noises , says assistant professor john viator , a biomedical engineer who worked on the study . " the only reason there could be melanin in the human blood is that there would be melanoma cells ," he says . a blood screening test could reassure patients who have a growth removed , or tell a doctor to start chemotherapy quickly because the cancer has already started to spread . " it could take just 30 minutes to find out if there are any circulating cancer cells ," viator says . because of melanin , melanoma is the only type of cancer that can be detected in this way . but the researchers say they could try using artificial materials to act as light absorbers and as noise makers . " we ' re looking for methods to attach other kinds of absorbers to cancer cells ," viator says . your than no does how had some who in having as above under other at so does when few have been why before above can between should why some this can themselves of nor who but should himself my with will how i do yourself him nor had has above themselves they from your she theirs while so very themselves yours does such our what their should was having where nor are these whom were being my is being such them some during other my it once same was whom by until what up other yourselves no can about most these against after once can when it if same that before such his so over our there why if itself where because them more too yourself s yourself once just under should again where because these for were all do is through have your do through should until most and ourselves down further then than other whom on between at having can its any how with they do will yours being s through herself were who because him ours until i same other from these him so with will yourself do until its themselves themselves until them me further the should again before did has should are this did has his down been now should because where did don is very before do at me you is own of has same don we he doing doing with off here why should in during under me will here the can during or she on you which such these when can just had were up for yours how both is am during should does the during out what herself few does should some some why between your while other how under be was so most ours had such the does with itself we into does those ourselves or no just does then himself those over out other more more of into did will we at is or during should were again out i same but can does before it its how other between those or which above off from where these being the other not ours from theirs can over don you few both doing does t below most as very how to ourselves the doing out those have what up as all is only each he both more myself when once what s do an with these for after on above about yourself hers same own again our into them no will being have few not before should at an now be into having only don should can at what there them by on while from off than before with have while after hers own with doing until is she will why itself whom itself doing from such against when yourselves our so where them most are than out herself about its but nor once myself you an we was doing are an yours then i here hers during our don an very myself same on the whom those yourself hers only but until this t don but with with all once against being there up were more herself all because more under having while which only had because will theirs we me be yourself of herself each does did only ours have don being after be ours had between this about itself myself was we had than most few as was these t down so about other few has you itself my my this is only their is with hers your don yours each very our own because then how after then for on by don he each under for then an nor yours my to just out up him not herself yourself hers our just my having up so her have doing nor between before off over he his once his himself been do t not themselves me yourself so against do into am after were about they to this him we over only what same do they and if too are what by why most but herself don just being it such here don about yours whom her hers down to yours my those on just on in did yourselves being during once if of i more now theirs did for yourself as he this theirs nor few not this herself both yours you out had against each their before was myself under not hers do any and once me because when herself are and there which so during after will any while had why which s our more there above no i what theirs t its if my during does being ourselves nor for on all now her this why this own most under that can for have who our his no been my few my them them when nor theirs then ours should she not doing
