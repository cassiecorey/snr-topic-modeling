scientists have found what ' s thought to be the first link between storms on earth and turbulence in space thunderstorms on earth can lead to storms in the outer reaches of the atmosphere that disrupt radio transmissions and other electronic communications , us researchers say . the research , which is published in a recent issue of the journal geophysical research letters , is believed to be the first time researchers have found a global link between weather on earth and in space . the discovery could lead to more reliable global - positioning satellite ( gps ) navigation and short - wave radio transmissions by improving forecasts of high - altitude disturbances that can disrupt them , says university of california , berkeley researcher dr thomas immel . using data from nasa satellites , immel and other researchers discovered that thunderstorms over south america , africa and southeast asia can create turbulence above the equator in part of the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere . the ionosphere is formed from solar x - rays and ultraviolet light , which break apart atoms and molecules in the upper atomosphere , creating a layer of electrically charged gas known as plasma . the densest part of the ionosphere forms two bands of plasma close to the equator at a hight of about 400 kilometres . these plasma bands are far too thin to be directly affected by wind from thunderstorms . but the researchers found that the wind can shape the plasma bands by generating electricity in the layer of atmosphere below them . three of the densest sections of plasma were located directly above areas with frequent thunderstorms : the amazon basin in south america , the congo basin in africa , and indonesia . but the researchers found another dense section of plasma above the pacific ocean , far from thunderstorm zones . they say this is evidence that tropical thunderstorms have a global influence . that may explain why the ionosphere above north america is more turbulent than other areas , disrupting radio transmissions that travel through it . " we now know that accurate predictions of ionospheric disturbances have to incorporate this effect from tropical weather ," immel says . researchers now hope to determine if the plasma bands shift with the seasons , or during large events like hurricanes . about myself the them so ourselves an who me during to while or and both against into i just s those than into if to it very no it who themselves your more after s only by up not some was in do own about between into about below below that or with they did off has in on through during over whom be through some nor be no at by such been these t hers as here theirs further on after then few out am here then but can between because themselves under each other had whom into is both he while him having it herself who while until up just by he its if there it herself has at had s not with themselves than only don be is does don theirs do where yourself myself we all once nor there it because now now we those so below there down itself while it been both its theirs does that further him each by while herself myself each very were too only t have his before has before have his or to his had themselves while it the itself themselves if a why himself off then just through some only are yourselves from now their than whom yourselves my you if very few yourself once such each ours once then some this s themselves do yours does s those be off all during my am ours there about no so more have will about up now that is than in then for at are just who when between there s had most her t an to ourselves most from have than nor before too it himself out am him his can were more t is them no himself are doing any between how nor other for again on to whom had be them me has until why yourself until her am so her did its has its than be him a should which yourselves a at don he such more my where am have on than where he will some has some while before have at am itself do hers him but i down while other me then hers of under now after was own all all some if its any being are ours am or nor very after here once at theirs not can is an very just more into or down who during hers our above down yourself here were me doing same until at was why up but their do from can from or herself down his again and not then me have myself does no the against myself its in himself these no t once so from our being because he or she there yours that themselves don herself their into while been our with here ours then there can that not me before until his you by was each doing those which this how few ours only that then any further same are them above between what myself each do my than can any such between what about yourself has there as too below yours yourselves himself its all that against but until further those in under not other yours been had which no himself because does to been through against our during as the s down few had should whom so she not in yours when about did again our off then only myself through same before in we doing this until into there while yours off t he same only am this each by this there off very at their who than my how it him of herself before did at under with before same such yours up then between why under there been the them doing during have why few be then don such did will up only she having any more that my in for or whom has with above she between through having him up do for yourself there doing most through yourselves where not into themselves further her after during all until by their who before what their who to can out its down an my all yourselves all he does when only whom same than did over doing before about own which which what he do himself whom from yourselves your own be about than nor was its than both who yours ours he during above have any about doing at nor other don it off t again or such when i own your you those once at other all myself of here up be when our him this having nor off are myself once under doing me own doing so your what about that down being me all above have me before has each t into where now of both what not itself them but such are any over having down did under having for there for itself their any he t being again then the with of him had only below by not she its being him yours at through in s few
