bacteria found in household sewage can generate their own electricity . now scientists say they are one step closer to harnessing it the waste water we flush down the loo could one day be used to generate electricity , scientists from belgium say . the ghent university researchers have designed a way to boost the output of microbial fuel cells , an emerging technology that captures the energy produced when bacteria break down waste and turn it into electrical current . investigators from around the world are researching the potential of microbial fuel cells , but prototypes so far have only produced tiny amounts of electricity . " at the moment we are still at the stage of basic research , but the potential for the technology is good ," says associate professor zhiguo yuan , from the advanced wastewater management centre at australia ' s university of queensland . the latest paper , which appears in the journal environmental science and technology , brings the concept closer to reality . the researchers show that six small fuel cells stacked together can generate higher voltages and increased current . " the efficiency of these systems is determined by the distances the electrons have to travel ," says co - author dr korneel rabaey . " if you want to generate a lot of power from microbial fuel cells , you have to have a very thin reactor . but you also need to be able to work with a high volume of waste water ." putting several small cells together ticks both of those boxes , says rabaey , who moved to the university of queensland a month ago . " this work shows one step we need to make larger scale designs ." but scientists aren ' t sure exactly which bugs generate the electricity in the fuel cells . " there is a mixture of those that can live in that environment ," says yuan . treating water scientists are most interested in using microbe - generated electricity to power the water treatment process itself . as well as producing current , the technology can also help clear bacteria out of the water . it might also clean out substances like sulfur and nitrogen . once scientists figure out how to build large - scale fuel cells , rabaey says , the cells will probably be used first to treat industrial waste water . the idea of using stuff we flush down the toilet to power our light bulbs is probably a more distant hope . but he says it is not out of the question . " the amount of energy that is in waste is incredible ," he says . " just one sugar - cube , for example , has enough energy to power a laptop for 12 hours . and the stuff in our waste water is just different forms of sugar ." whom our does yourself the whom her out
