the artificial muscles work just like real ones , converting chemical energy into mechanical energy artificial muscles have been made in the lab that are 100 times stronger than the real thing , a recent study shows . two kinds of these super - strong artificial muscles can convert chemical energy into mechanical energy , making them function like natural muscles , the scientists say . dr von howard ebron and colleagues , from the nanotech institute at university of texas at dallas report their progress in the current issue of the journal science . the artificial muscles could help usher in an entirely new breed of so - called fuel - cell muscles , the scientists say . these receive chemical fuel , such as hydrogen or methanol , through a circulatory system , convert it to mechanical energy , and store any unused energy for later . such muscles could be used to move robots and robotic exoskeletons , or as part of structures on air and marine vehicles that morph into different shapes . " in the future , the humanoid robot sitting next to you at the bar may be drinking alcohol in order to work the next day ," says professor ray baughman , the research team leader and director of the nanotech institute . one of the most successful kinds of artificial muscle consists of a stretchy material , which does not conduct electricity , sandwiched between two layers of material that do . when an electric current is applied , the plus and minus charges accumulate on opposite layers of the sandwich . they are attracted to each other and squeeze down on the rubbery centre , giving the muscle its flexing ability . a cord or batteries normally supply the power . but baughman ' s team created two kinds of artificial muscles charged by a chemical reaction , eliminating the need for range - limiting power cords and bulky , short - lived batteries . " the approach is not without challenges , but it could transform the way complex mechanical systems are built ," writes dr john madden , an assistant professor at the university of british columbia , in the same issue of the journal . carbon nanotubes in the first approach , the scientists coated a sheet made of pure carbon nanotubes with platinum nanoparticles . they immersed the sheet into a solution of sulfuric acid . a chemical reaction accelerated by the platinum catalyst converts each molecule of the hydrogen fuel to two protons and two electrons . repulsion between the electrons causes the nanotubes to expand . in the second approach , the scientists used a special filament known as shape - memory wire , which can be trained to contract into a particular shape when heat is applied to it . the team coated a straight memory wire with platinum nanoparticles and then exposed it to vapours from methanol mixed with air . a chemical reaction occurred between the the alcohol and the oxygen in the air , which produced heat and caused the wire to contract . both types of muscles could be used in autonomous robots or as robotic armor worn by soldiers or astronauts to give them super - human strength , the scientists say . baughman imagines that the technology could eventually use sugars in the human body as fuel and enzymes instead of platinum to work one important artificial muscle : a heart . an had up myself does being were no and most further who same his yourself it can who once all who after few a few under through through as too it s above at with
