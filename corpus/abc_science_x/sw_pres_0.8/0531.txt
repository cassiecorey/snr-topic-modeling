chimp or lollipop man ? dominant chimps look both ways to see if the road ' s clear before shepherding other chimps across adult male chimpanzees act like school lollipop men by leading smaller chimps across roads that dissect their forest habitats , according to a new study . the finding demonstrates that chimps display concern for family and friends and will risk their own safety to ensure the welfare of others . scientists now believe such ability for care and consideration is present in certain primates , and not just humans . " i think that we would definitely see this kind of behaviour in other great ape species , and different populations may reveal cultural differences in protective orderings ," says kimberley hockings , lead author of the study , which is published in the journal current biology . hockings , a researcher at the university of stirling in scotland , and colleagues observed a group of wild chimps in bossou , guinea , west africa . the chimp group consisted of three adult males , five adult females , three juveniles and one infant . two roads dissect the chimps ' forest homeland . the first is a narrow road used by pedestrians , while the second is wider and carries trucks , motorbikes , cars , as well as pedestrians . the scientists analysed 19 instances where the chimpanzees crossed the two roads . in each instance , an adult male , often the alpha male named yolo , would stand at the edge of the road . he then would carefully look left and right , then motion with an arm . at that point , the other chimps formed themselves into an ordered line and followed behind . the order nearly always consisted of adult males first with females , juveniles and the infant second . the leader , or another adult male , would then wait at the end of the line to assist the littlest ones . when crossing the heavier traffic road , the second ranked male , foaf , would continue to scan for vehicles and people while the elderly third male , tua , and the alpha female took the lead . the researchers noted that the female would move into the more forward , leader position when the degree of crossing risk increased . " they tend to travel in such ordered lines in risky situations such as road crossing and crop raiding ," says hockings . " depending on the situation , when moving through the forest , it is much more common that the chimpanzees are spread out ." dr klaus zuberb & uuml ; hler is a university of st andrews scientist who conducts research on the cognitive capacities of non - human primates . the scotland - based scientist calls the findings " amazing ". " what ' s perhaps most striking is that kimberly ' s research shows that these free - ranging chimpanzees are not indifferent to the welfare of other group members , in contrast to previous findings reported from captive chimpanzees ," zuberb & uuml ; hler says . " they appear to have an understanding of other group members ' vulnerability and they take action in response to this knowledge . " it also highlights the importance of studying the cognitive capacities of primates in the wild . the majority of research on chimpanzee intelligence is currently conducted in highly deprived lab situations , and , perhaps unsurprisingly , individuals often show little or no interest in engaging in cooperative or altruistic acts ." hockings hopes future research will determine similar progression orders in other great ape populations , which could reveal how human social organisation probably emerged in our distant primate ancestors . as were yours were than other has over had from
