it took an average of 3 to 4 months for men to regain their fertility after stopping the ' pill '. but some men had to wait as long as 2 years worries that the male contraceptive ' pill ' may wreck a man ' s chance of fathering a child are unfounded , says a new study . men given a hormone - based contraceptive can regain their fertility about four months after stopping the treatment , researchers report today in the lancet journal . drug companies have been working on a male pill or injection to inhibit sperm production and give couples a greater choice of family planning methods . the three main male contraceptive methods - the condom , withdrawal and vasectomy - are regarded by many as insufficiently reliable or difficult to reverse . the male pill uses the hormone androgen , or a mixture of androgen and progestogen , to suppress sperm production to zero or negligible levels . us and australian scientists analysed studies involving men who had been given the contraceptives in trials and found the treatments were highly effective but reversible . " hormonal male contraceptive methods could soon become widely available ," says dr peter liu currently at the anzac research institute at the university of sydney . " these findings thereby increase the promise of new contraceptive drugs allowing men to share more fairly the satisfaction and burden of family planning ." large - scale trials of male hormone - based contraceptives are being conducted in china and europe , the scientists say . liu and his team analysed data on 1500 men who had taken part in 30 trials that had been published between 1990 and 2005 . all participants recovered fertility after they stopped taking the hormones . on average , it took 3 . 4 months to achieve this , defined as a threshold of 20 million sperm per millilitre . but some men took as long as two years to regain their fertility . the researchers say various factors , including age , original sperm count , duration of treatment and ethnic origin , could influence the recovery rate . two of the study authors are employed by pharmaceutical companies . some very being over down myself there himself but themselves here only while our should into have be while by
