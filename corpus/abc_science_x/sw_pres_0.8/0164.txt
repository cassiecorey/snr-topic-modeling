combining alcohol with an energy drink makes you feel sober enough to drive even though you ' re over the limit , new research shows people who combine energy drinks with alcohol can feel more sober than they truly are , a new study suggests . brazilian researchers found that young men were no less impaired when they drank a mix of alcohol and a popular energy drink than when they downed a standard mixed drink . but drinkers seemed to think they were less drunk . according to research in the april issue of the journal alcoholism : clinical & experimental research , the drinkers reported less fatigue , fewer headache symptoms and better coordination . this is concerning because people who mistakenly think they are less impaired can be a danger to themselves and others , according to study co - author dr maria lucia souza - formigoni . " i think people should be aware of this effect of the combination . they feel better but they are not ' good enough ' to drive , for instance ," says souza - formigoni , an associate professor at the federal university of sao paulo . energy drinks typically consist of carbohydrates , b vitamins , caffeine and taurine , a derivative of an amino acid found in animal tissue . some studies have shown that the beverages , or their main ingredients , may improve mood and physical performance . and there ' s a popular , though unproven , belief that mixing energy drinks with alcohol can counter some of the effects of drinking . this new study suggests that while energy drinks may help drinkers feel less tipsy , they are still in fact drunk . mixing your drinks the study included 26 young men who each took part in three separate experiments : one in which they drank vodka mixed with an energy drink , another in which they had vodka mixed with fruit juice , and a third where they drank only the energy drink . in general , the researchers found that the men reported fewer headache symptoms and less weakness with the energy drink - alcohol mixture compared with the standard mixed drink . they also thought their hand - eye coordination was sharper . but the men performed no better on objective tests of hand - eye coordination and reaction time to visual cues . one of the dangers of this effect , according to souza - formigoni and her colleagues , is that drinkers , especially young ones , may feel free to drink more than they might otherwise have . depressive effects on the brain it ' s not clear , souza - formigoni says , why study participants feel less drunk when they had the energy drink even though they were still objectively impaired . but in animal research , she and her colleagues have found that some energy drinks ingredients , mostly caffeine and taurine , may counter some of the depressive effects alcohol has on the brain . the findings in humans , however , suggest that ' s not enough to avoid becoming drunk . their from both theirs itself if their through these which don same only few on was is only own about when through these for than with before
