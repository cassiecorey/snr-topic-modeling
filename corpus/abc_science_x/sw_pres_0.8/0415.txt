implanting false memories can have health benefits like preventing alcohol abuse . but is it ethical to brainwash people ? implanting false memories of a bad experience with alcohol could prevent people abusing alcohol in later life , a canadian researcher says . dr dan bernstein from kwantlen university college , shows that if people are led to believe they once drank themselves sick it can affect their taste for a particular drink . he presented the unpublished research , conducted over the past year , at the 4th international conference on memory in sydney today . in the study 142 people aged 18 - 20 were told they had had a bad past experience with alcoholic drinks including rum . " we wanted to know whether there were consequences to false memory and we looked at whether we could increase people ' s confidence that they got sick drinking rum some time in their past ," bernstein says . " what we find is that if you ' ve increased your confidence that you ' ve got sick drinking rum , you now give rum less preference ." rewriting the past participants ' memories were manipulated by telling them that a computer had generated a personal profile based on a questionnaire about past eating and drinking habits . they were told they had become sick on rum in the past and they were asked to elaborate on that experience . about a quarter of the participants became more confident that they had actually been sick on rum . " we find that between 30 and 40 % increased their confidence for the critical item in comparison to a control group ," he says . when they were asked to rate how much they liked rum they rated it less highly than before their memories were manipulated . ethical issues bernstein says if it can be shown that implanting false memories can have a long - term effect on putting people off certain alcoholic drinks it could be a useful deterrent to alcohol abuse . " if we showed that it had a lasting behavioural effect then it could possibly have some preventative utility , but that ' s a long way off ," he says . professor mike toglia , a us expert in false memories from the state university of new york , who wasn ' t involved in the research , says bernstein ' s work offers a new application for this field of memory research . he acknowledges there are ethical issues about brainwashing . " there ' s always been the concern that implanting false memories is a form of brainwashing and some people believe that maybe this kind or research should be stopped for that reason ," he says . " but i think the good that can be done can outweigh the risks ." beating obesity manipulating memory could also be used to prevent overeating , bernstein says . but prior bad experiences don ' t create an aversion to all foods and drinks , bernstein says , only those with a distinct or unusual flavour . " with some drinks and some food you may have got sick but it doesn ' t seem to have this imprint , this lasting effect ," he says . he says his previous research managed to induce an aversion to strawberry ice cream , but didn ' t work so well when it came to chips . " we couldn ' t turn them off potato chips ," he says . " in fact we got a little rebound and they thought ' give me more !'" into this doing then while her above or same it nor during himself too those again she have through until were more after where
