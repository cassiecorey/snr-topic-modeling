but this research won ' t turn a pot belly into a flat stomach stem cells taken from human fat can be transformed into smooth muscle cells , offering a way to treat diseases of the heart , gut and bladder , us researchers report . while the experiment does not quite offer a way to turn a pot belly into a flat stomach , the researchers say the transformed cells contracted and relaxed just like smooth muscle cells . these cells help the heart beat and blood flow , push food through the digestive system and make bladders fill and empty , the researchers report . their study , published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences today , is the latest to show that fat can be a rich source of the body ' s master cells . " fat tissue may prove a reliable source of smooth muscle cells that we can use to regenerate and repair damaged organs ," says dr larissa rodriguez , an assistant professor in the urology department at the university of california los angeles medical school . rodriguez and colleagues incubated adipose - derived stem cells in a nourishing mixture of growth factors , human proteins that encouraged the cells to become smooth muscle cells . the researchers say scientists have been looking for sources of smooth muscle for organ repair and treating heart disease , gastrointestinal diseases and bladder dysfunction . " a major obstacle for such an approach has been finding a reliable source of healthy smooth muscle cells that can be safely harvested and that require minimal manipulation ," they write . clean , healthy fat one approach has been to take a patient ' s own cells from an organ . but studies have shown that stem cells taken from a diseased organ are also damaged and do not work well when scientists try to grow them in the lab for a transplant . transplants grown from a patient ' s own fat could be used with no need for anti - rejection drugs , rodriguez says . smooth muscle cells have been produced from stem cells found in the brain and bone marrow , but acquiring stem cells from fat is much easier , she adds . the stem cells found in fat are known as multipotent stem cells . they can produce a variety of cell and tissue types , but are not as flexible as embryonic stem cells . others also looking at fat many groups have been looking to fat as a source of stem cells . in april , cytori therapeutics said it was starting a clinical trial to test whether stem cells derived from fat can be used to regenerate breast tissue . other researchers have been trying to get stem cells from liposuction specimens . in a second study published in the same journal , uk researchers say they found one important protein that keeps stem cells in a quiescent and non - dividing stage . dr fiona watt of cancer research uk and colleagues studied stem cells from human skin and found a protein known as lrig1 kept the skin cells from proliferating . when lrig1 production was silenced , the stem cells began growing and dividing . the finding may not only offer important information to stem cell researchers , but may also offer insights into cancer , watt ' s team says . in cancer , cells ignore the normal signals from the body and proliferate uncontrollably . the protein is also involved in psoriasis . or we her each if same more most yourselves me how with should myself at yours
