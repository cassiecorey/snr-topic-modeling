professor frederick short retrieving marked plants from australia ' s great barrier reef seagrasses around the world are in decline , according to a global study that says human impact is largely to blame . but australia ' s ' underwater forests ' in queensland have bucked the trend and are generally in good shape , the researchers find . seagrass beds are shallow water ecosystems , like a forest on the ocean floor . not only do they serve as protective nurseries for juvenile fish and shellfish , and a habitat and feeding ground for many marine species , they protect the coastline from currents and weather - related erosion . since 2001 , the university of new hampshire ' s professor frederick short and colleagues have been running the global monitoring program seagrassnet . this has involved monitoring seagrass health at 45 sites in 17 countries worldwide , including australia . in general , the researchers found a decline in seagrass around the world . while they have not ruled out globate climate change as a factor , they believe human impact is mainly to blame . for example , at a state park in malaysia researchers discovered that seagrass decline was due to on - shore logging . this had increased the level of water - borne sediments , thus decreasing light reaching the bottom where seagrasses grow . when seagrass beds disappear , the impact is major . for example , a disease outbreak in the 1930s wiped out 90 % of eelgrass in the north atlantic . as a result , the scallop fishery in the mid - atlantic disappeared and never really recovered . the scientists are also monitoring seagrass beds in thailand , home to shellfish , to see the effects of the 2004 tsunami . healthy pockets rob coles , principal scientist with queensland ' s department of primary industries and fisheries , based at the northern fisheries centre , cairns , led the australian arm of the research . he says the good news is that seagrass beds off green island , 25 kilometres east of cairns , are very healthy . and so are seagrasses he and his colleague monitor in 50 sites across queensland as part of the seagrass watch initiative . he puts that down to low population density , good light , clean water and comprehensive water management and conservation programs . " in fact , there is no real loss of seagrass in the great barrier reef world heritage area that we really know about . there have been temporary losses due to storm damage and we ' ve had a big loss in hervey bay due to cyclone damage , [ and declines in some areas of the whitsundays ], but generally [ it ' s good ]," he says . " but that ' s not to say there is no cause for concern because increasingly people are moving to the coast and that will eventually impact on shallow water seagrasses . so we must [ remain vigilant
