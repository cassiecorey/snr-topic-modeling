could graffiti be a sign of something more serious than teen rebellion ? teens who get involved in graffiti ' tagging ' may be showing early symptoms of a personality disorder , an australian psychiatrist says . professor graham martin , director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the university of queensland and colleagues , studied more than 2600 people aged 13 . he says the study , presented at an international child and adolescent mental health conference in melbourne this week , found that teens who graffiti " are significantly different to those who do not graffiti ". " they satisfy the ... criteria for conduct disorder and or delinquency and later down the track a number of these young people go on to antisocial behaviour personality disorder ," he says . " these young people ... were very antisocial on a range of other factors . they weren ' t just mildly conduct disordered , they were scoring to the extreme range of antisocial behaviour ." martin says the findings of the study show that conventional methods of handling young graffiti offenders , such as dealing with them under the legal system , are doomed to failure . but he says the good news is that with intensive individual , family and community therapy it ' s possible to put people back on track . " graffiti may be one gateway into working with young people to assist them to find a new direction ," he says . " it may be extending their creative skills or just sitting down with them and saying , listen you ' ve had a bit of a shit life haven ' t you ?" subtexts of graffiti martin says tagging conveys a number of messages , from saying " hello , i ' m here " to being a territorial marker and an expression of rage against authority . he says the study found adolescent graffitists had done around six to eight other acts , such as setting fires , beating people up and stealing . they also had higher rates of drug use , academic failure , physical and sexual abuse , depression , anxiety and suicidal thoughts . of the teenagers studied , about 12 % of boys and almost 11 % of girls had done some graffiti . it may even be possible to pick a future graffitist , martin says , underlining the importance of early intervention . " you can pick many of these young people somewhere around the age of three ," he says . " the average kindergarten teacher will tell you , i don ' t like that child , i can ' t work with them , they spit at me , they spit at the other kids , they hit people , they won ' t learn . " you can certainly predict which ones will go on to antisocial behaviour , and within that graffiti is going to be one of the things that stands out ." no am those about more did have had or then
