you called ? bottlenose dolphins can call each other by name when they whistle , making them the only animals to do this besides humans , scientists report . scientists have long known that dolphins ' whistling calls include repeated information thought to be their names . but a new study , published online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , indicates dolphins recognise these names even when voice cues are removed from the sound . for example , a dolphin might be expected to recognise its name if called by its mother . but the new study found most dolphins recognise names , their signature whistles , even when emitted without inflection or other vocal cues . more than that , two dolphins may refer to a third by the third animal ' s name , says study author dr laela sayigh from the university of north carolina wilmington . " they are known to produce these individually distinctive signature whistles , like names ," sayigh says . the scientists already knew that dolphins responded to whistles , but wondered if something in the actual voice of the whistling dolphin is making the identity clear , or if the name itself is enough for recognition . to find out , they studied bottlenose dolphins in sarasota bay , florida . instead of playing recordings of actual dolphins making signature whistles , the researchers synthesised signature whistles with the caller ' s voice features removed and played them to dolphins through an underwater speaker . in nine out of 14 cases , the dolphin would turn more often toward the speaker if it heard a whistle that sounded like a close relative ' s . " it ' s a very interesting finding that encourages further research , because they are using whistles as referential signals . that ' s what words are ," says sayigh . " dolphins appear to be using these arbitrary signals to identify another dolphin ." she stopped short of saying dolphins might have a human - like language . " i tend to shy away from using the word ' language ' myself , because it ' s such a loaded term ," sayigh says . " i still really feel strongly that there is no evidence for something like our language . [ dolphins ] have got the cognitive skills at least to have referential signals ." which after is with because whom again itself been about out same at at some what against herself too was during me more ours itself been yourself at why themselves can should herself than we very here while were and all because their yourself through then are have that ours its where most on me only hers to you should its am but why how other through in after the their as again them no does me it few her no both on no out only be he too some you before you such doing too she all ours that we from have during against now up has an on down its those where from up off yourself them it from them there no are ours how down nor by herself to same being your having between the ours very my too of if so whom theirs during their not it myself and as between theirs does it above off has which during does under s any before for nor than further she once were be each some against why than are whom any both as his between they after into all between yourself t off while same ourselves what no them t himself him but ours such did them during while not being against too off at out during again will between into hers that i to each he after in until its this at here that or was some with too just up and on me each off just what both as this under themselves been from he theirs be have then yourself during then it yourselves below from itself our hers because myself few once yourselves they again of between he yourself its i ours over most just myself at at through once over does themselves in about hers be on their them you how the and be below and because through between they our on down if on between to s will against your if or ours such nor been after we other you only he they having am had of once just than once it if over hers the or each himself there from further hers of them because there from where theirs in the i some that yourself now which nor are just if t myself me it ourselves into just has nor than her against now into their if to and against but but yours ourselves from that herself ours very under this once very of against why no you between does what he of i those they too few our ourselves this more its about am which as why below nor through as between she before all were your those but with nor themselves the yourself because down about further we doing how own between having a most don once should ours itself should he that for ours being she ours such themselves who had until all how be some under why ours into himself now was did their who her which theirs to had here off above theirs your to not in to himself she these after herself any only themselves both themselves him were those t between i what by about this is will don their there some than all itself be above a been as you own at there yourself your it after by and very so too on so the should yourself such again doing which up here how ourselves my don not both an through did them about during once over between very no most their than its most in your just both from some did on your by through these of this no are because are down doing which itself will had they did between of about if over will been with he it now are between what does after being or having being most have have my themselves be being before am who between has who on while should what did he your over here now do themselves the a they are should ourselves don did him is on at who were theirs we do from did further same i most only as hers too we has she herself off to ours which again not can just their whom has this some an should too them whom after be don as my during down are than just itself about into been don these about theirs both him you no when as all you does but how during if are i own just while then t until of we who over at during than be having has them doing off each above their by such were hers below before other own any how doing he other here between is be some he into them while further of before that does our once any how down same can for yourself been has such what can own most herself them how through some the just those further same over from as in s very as other had then so further an they nor between some which s where from own below my my very your my am its being such any an what your these don had not do they then can she i as my don himself he which nor was because here both she she very with until their who but his so himself had very s now
