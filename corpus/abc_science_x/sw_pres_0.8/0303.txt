metamaterials could create the ultimate optical illusion : invisibility - although it wouldn ' t quite look like this new materials that can change the way light and other forms of radiation bend around an object may provide a way to make things invisible , say researchers . two separate teams of researchers report in today ' s issue the journal science that experimental " metamaterials " could be used to hide an object from visible light , infrared light , microwaves and perhaps even sonar probes . their work suggests that science - fiction portrayals of invisibility , such as the cloaking devices used to hide space ships in star trek , might be truly possible . harry potter ' s cloak or the invisible man of films and fiction might be a bit harder to emulate , however , because the thing to be made invisible will have to be encased in a thick shell of metamaterials . metamaterials are composite structures that deliberately resemble nothing found in nature . they are engineered to have unusual properties , such as the ability to bend light in unique ways . " the [ metamaterial ] cloak would act like you ' ve opened up a hole in space ," says dr david r . smith , a professor of electrical and computer engineering at duke university in north carolina and co - author of one of the papers in science . " all light or other electromagnetic waves are swept around the area , guided by the metamaterial to emerge on the other side as if they had passed through an empty volume of space ." unlike modern " stealth " bombers that bounce radar off their surfaces so they cannot be seen , an object could be encased in a shell of metamaterials . "[ it ] would create an illusion akin to a mirage ," says co - author dr david schurig , also of duke university . like all physics , the invisibility idea requires a little imagination . " think of space as a woven cloth ," says shurig . " imagine making a hole in the cloth by inserting a pointed object between the threads without tearing them ." the light , or microwaves , or radar would travel along the threads of the cloth , ending up behind the object without having touched it . " you just need the right set of material properties and you can guide light ," shurig says . defence project the duke university researchers started working on metamaterials with a grant from the defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ). such materials could provide super - light electronics in aircraft or cars , or highly efficient lenses . the researchers came up with the idea of using these materials to bend light and other electromagnetic radiation . " we are going to try to have an experimental demonstration of these effects . there are a few more steps to go . we are working on these steps ," says smith . shurig says anyone making such a cloak would have to choose what form of radiation one wanted invisibility from . also , the invisibility would work both ways - a person hidden from the visible light spectrum would have to use infrared or sonar or microwaves to see out , he says . " if want to cover the whole visible spectrum that would a tall order ," says shurig . a second paper in science , by uk - based professor of theoretical physics , dr ulf leonhardt at the university of st andrews , also proposes an invisibility device using metamaterials . are her your did his she same ourselves once an them will ours there t s just s has hers further below such ours don itself
