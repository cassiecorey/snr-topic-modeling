is the whinny a horse makes when it sees someone it likes different from the one it makes when it sees someone it doesn ' t like ? a new database of horse talk and behaviour could help take the mystery out of a horse whisperer ' s job , us researchers hope . physicist david browning , an adjunct professor at the university of rhode island , and dr peter scheifele , a research associate at the university of connecticut are compiling the database in an attempt to correlate nuances in horse whinnies with their differences stress levels . they announced their equine vocalization project last week at an acoustical society of america meeting in providence , rhode island . the information could help shed light on the communication styles of other equines , such as donkeys and zebras , and even improve how veterinarians , behaviourists , breeders or other animal handlers relate to horses . " you would like to find that you get a particular whinny for a particular situation ," says browning . snorts , blows , sighs and whinnies unlike the monotonal vocalisations of cows , goats , and sheep , horses emit a range of sounds from snorts , blows and sighs to whinnies , which also come in the form of nickers and squeals . browning ' s initial acoustical studies have shown that whinnies have the greatest changes in frequency and could contain information about specific situations . when horses are stressed , their vocalisations peak into a high - pitched screams ; when they are calm , their whinnies modulate in the middle tones . but scientists are still not sure if the changes in frequency can be connected to more specific conditions . browning and scheifele have begun compiling their database of horse vocalisations from their own recordings and from those of other researchers . the vocalisations are analysed with acoustic software that plots the sound over time . they have been categorising the vocalisations by behaviour in order to answer some basic questions . for example , horses have a good memory and can recognise friends , both human and horse . browning would like to know if the whinny they make when they see someone they like is different from one they make upon seeing someone they don ' t like . zebras that bark like a dog as part of the project , browning will also be collecting vocalisations of three species of zebra - one that brays like a donkey , one that whinnies like a horse , and one that barks like a dog - to try and get a more complete picture of equine vocalisations . dr sarah ralston an associate professor at the equine science center at rutgers university , isn ' t sure how much the study will contribute to the practicality of handling horses . but she does think that comparing the vocalisation of horses and zebras could provide some insight into the social organisation of different equines . " one [ zebra ] is like a horse with harems and lives in groups , whereas another is more solitary . differences in vocalisations might reflect differences in the social organisation ," she says .
