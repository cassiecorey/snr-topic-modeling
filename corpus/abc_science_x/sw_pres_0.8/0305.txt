forensic jigsaw puzzle : fungi are helping scientists to estimate the time of death deceased individuals supposedly ' push up daisies ', but a new study suggests human cadavers are more likely to support several species of white and yellow fungi . the study is the first to describe in detail species of fungi obtained from human corpses . in the future , forensics experts may use the information during criminal investigations to determine when someone died . fungi , parasitic plants that lack chlorophyll , leaves and true roots and stems , often form part of the natural decomposition process that recycles nutrients back into the food chain . " the fungi feed on the dead ," says lead author kiyoshi ishii , whose team ' s findings are published in the may issue of the journal legal medicine . ishii , a biologist at dokkyo university school of medicine in japan , and his colleagues analysed two humans whose bodies were found decomposing in very different environments . the first was a corpse discovered lying face down on a concrete floor in an abandoned house . police determined the body belonged to a 72 - year - old man who had been missing for 10 months . the scientists observed yellow and white fungi on the deceased ' s chest , abdomen and thighs , but little insect infestation , probably because the house was dry and isolated . the second case study involved skeletal remains clad in a shirt and pants found in a forest . forensics specialists determined the body belonged to a 50 to 60 - year - old man who had died at least 6 months before the body ' s discovery . the scientists once again detected yellow and white fungi growing on the corpse . back in the lab ishii and his team collected the fungi and incubated them in a laboratory . they identified several species including gliocladium , a slimy counterpart to penicillin ; eurotium chevalieri , a fungus that can be bright yellow ; and e . repens , which is commonly found in soil . the eurotium species dominated the collected samples . ishii explains that the white and yellow colours are associated with the sexual stages for eurotium fungi . the parasite produces threadlike filaments that terminate with circular , colourful structures called ascomata that are involved in reproduction . the fungi also produce colourful conidia , or asexual spores , which tend to form in the morning and germinate in the afternoon and evening . ishii says the environment in which a body lies , rather than the biochemistry of the individual or the manner of death , tends to dictate how much or how little fungi will colonise a cadaver . flies , beetles , fungi yuichi chigusa , a medical parasitologist and entomologist at dokkyo medical university ' s school of medicine , says that fly larvae usually infest corpses within an hour to a half - day after the victims ' death . they are then followed by coleoptera ( beetles ) and fungi . he is excited about the potential of fungi for further aiding detective work . " i am surprised that fungus is a potential tool for determining post mortem intervals in cadavers without infestation of dipteran larvae and / or beetles ," chigusa says . " therefore , i think it is very important that forensic pathologists , forensic entomologists and forensic mycologists cooperate in determining post mortem intervals during forensic analysis ." her
