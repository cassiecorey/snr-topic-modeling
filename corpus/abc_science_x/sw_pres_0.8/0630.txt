no single event , like a huge meteor strike , is solely responsible for a mass extinction , says new research . not even the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago if you can ' t decide if you prefer meteor impacts , volcanoes or some other explanation for earth ' s biggest mass extinction events , take heart : you no longer have to choose . a new statistical study of mass extinctions throughout the history of life on earth is backing the idea that no single meteor , volcanic eruption or other lone gunman is ever to blame . this even applies to the cretaceous - tertiary event that brought the end of dinosaurs 65 million years ago , the us researchers say . instead , the worst die - offs happen when some sort of interminable , multi - generational pressure on life is combined with a few powerful blows . it ' s what is now being called the press - pulse theory of mass extinctions . reading the cretaceous - tertiary extinction literature and conversations with colleagues " made me wonder whether the simplistic scenario of ' everything ' s fine until one day in june when the asteroid hits and everything goes to hell - in - a - hand - basket ' really explains the diversity of data ," says plant fossil expert associate professor nan arens of hobart and william smith colleges in new york . wouldn ' t it make more sense , she surmised , if certain species were already vulnerable when the triggering event happened ? to test the idea , she and then - undergraduate student ian west compiled a large database of marine organisms and their extinctions through geological time . they divvied up the past 488 million years into four groups : suspected meteor impacts ( pulses ), gigantic volcanic flood basalt eruptions ( presses ), periods with neither presses nor pulses , and times when press and pulse coincided . they then compared average extinction rates in each group . flood basalt eruptions are considered presses because they release vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and can change the earth ' s climate . single or multiple event ? the researchers found similar extinction rates when a pulse or press occurred by itself , and when neither was occurring , says arens . " however , when an impact occurred during a time of volcanic flood , that produced higher extinction rates ." arens is presenting her work this week at the annual meeting of the geological society of america in philadelphia . " the goal of our work was to come up with a unifying theory of mass extinctions ," says west . they also wanted to make the theory applicable to the rapid extinctions now being seen as a result of accelerating climate change ( press ) and the ongoing destruction of wild habitats by human activities worldwide ( pulse ). "[ the theory ] is essentially a more eloquent way of saying what i and many other palaeontologists have been saying for many years ," says professor gerta keller of princeton university . " namely that the impact - kill hypothesis is all wrong . impacts alone could not have been the killing mechanism for the k - t [ cretaceous - tertiary event ] or any of the other major mass extinctions ." volcanic activity in the late cretaceous case massive volcanism , the deccan traps eruption in india , and attendant climate change , coincided with an impact that pushed highly stressed biota over the brink . " i ' m very happy they have done the analysis based on the literature and come up with the same conclusions that palaeontologists have been preaching all along ," keller says . so while herself their
