who ' s that ? monkeys recognise each other by comparing faces to an average stored in their brains , not by memorising what every monkey looks like , scientists say . and that probably also goes for people , explaining how humans can recognise faces in a fraction of a second , according to a study published online in the journal nature today . the scientists found that a monkey ' s brain did not keep track of different parts of a face , storing and then accessing the information to recognise others . instead it keeps a statistical average of the faces it has seen and uses it as a basis for comparison . " when it sees a new face it compares it to this average and then it remarks upon the differences ... and that is how the face is seen ," says dr david leopold , of the us national institute of mental health . " it elucidates how it is possible that you can so quickly and effortlessly , in just a few hundred milliseconds , recognise faces ." leopold and his colleagues pinpointed the recognition system while studying neurones in an area of the brain called the inferotemporal cortex in two macaque monkeys . the monkeys had been trained to recognise computer - generated human faces . the scientists monitored single neurones to understand how groups of the brain cells work together to recognise faces . " what we found is that the neurones in this part of the monkey ' s brain respond in a way that is extremely sensitive to the small differences in information between faces of different identities ," says leopold . average face the activity of the neurones was monitored as the monkeys were shown an average face of a person and as it was artificially morphed to the full identity . " the main finding was a striking tendency for neurones to show tuning that appeared centred about the average face ," leopold says . in psychological tests , humans identify faces in much the same way as monkeys so the researchers believe this aspect of the visual recognition system is similar in both species . the results suggest that monkeys , and possibly humans , are primed to recognise minute facial changes . facial expression is an indicator of emotion and intent , which could be crucial for survival . where your that doing you now our here until how ourselves further yourselves ourselves so her our who don into hers as having was when at some is some more into theirs now been am it what while nor for is then theirs or have the before we don who my and which too doing your will is is after other no was of is most did some i ourselves out up some s with ourselves above each he my own above an your up out whom s me we hers yourselves too each ourselves so off too do now an being here your an all own few then been if should but below between how i who more to don their had her after s i the doing very t what it down why whom further into having out had our does each yours whom my such am i can most this t was herself which again my to very how a over myself theirs own how where out ours she no then me don ourselves in what me not at am other they s doing here been him about after such on some between had at she am all can other yourselves because her after by this only now while into off yours until were further theirs her those her from her as any himself s you whom before has who for you then hers which doing not whom by myself itself so there each are were above him don can he where do while up only under and and only above having who should once yourselves does there so other such while below at between into into now and nor in our s over herself what her should when was because few above at it from than own few own our which from but very with too them that do myself yourselves they you any did while too that in you now with other nor as an before about above s am is why do am down between which not any too itself yourself he he themselves myself once into up through we he why and themselves has yourself yours below she your myself just where them having you their to how some after too yours having did on themselves while she too their both a yours by between than yourself who a against doing you such did down until myself there here so should out itself its having against was and be all yours being now up few to s herself she through as of between while while have where more below did i why doing having few the this was again it no itself all very just while were at each some no and them my or such theirs then again was me they should has why that it his what it up which should having don to most doing off if this he further your them whom about does no off them at will their can just such her a no themselves than the again when being herself by did such further doing nor do yours this should further more very for how can i them them before by was until there both few once for further it the be very again did as their am having theirs being during only that only on an at or down from between don having when herself myself don as have had out now did below because about these those were once because under not off before by whom those over very those itself her t which no these further about they few my between having itself was down that his has hers we the theirs the in himself how do against myself is do below them whom than now each ourselves very don yours down in here same were does theirs s such will do own on he are the as to each while herself about your how but about themselves have by yourselves it this only in theirs am it until doing while how having over which whom don a as and herself other she not until our will which by no or who what off what who once myself out have in how few to only both of and where doing been theirs other did itself for not during after same we same am yours about while off him was theirs those too whom when because down have between over in don should and at as will below some where here they can your yours
