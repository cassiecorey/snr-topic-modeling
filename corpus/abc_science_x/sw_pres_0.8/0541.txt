not breathing while training with weights can increase the pressure on your eyes , potentially leading to glaucoma holding your breath while you ' re weight lifting can increase the risk of developing eye disease and potentially blindness , a study says . weight lifters who don ' t breathe while they ' re training can experience temporary increases in eye pressure that could heighten the risk of developing glaucoma , according to a study published in the archives of ophthalmology this week . researchers at the catholic university of brasilia in brazil measured the intraocular pressure of 30 men aged 18 to 40 during a bench press session . " we tested subjects performing a bench press , a popular exercise in [ gyms ]," the researchers say . a bench press is done by lying on your back on a bench and raising a bar bell above your chest . the researchers measured eye pressure while the subjects were holding their breath and compared this to when they were exhaling . the study found that eye pressure increased more if they were holding their breath than if they were breathing . according to the findings , 90 % of subjects had an increase in eye pressure when they didn ' t exhale while doing the bench presses , compared with 62 % who did . " the mean intraocular pressure increased significantly during weight lifting ," the researchers conclude . " prolonged weightlifting could be a potential risk factor for the development or progression of glaucoma ." musicians also at risk glaucoma is a condition associated with pressure on the eye . the pressure slowly destroys the optic nerve at the back of the eye , causing vision impairment and possible blindness . the researchers say the form of glaucoma relevant to weight lifters is known as normal - tension , or low - tension glaucoma . this is most common in people who experience frequent changes in eye pressure . the disease can be hard to pick up because it develops even though eye pressure is normal when it ' s measured in routine checks . it ' s also more common among people who play high - resistance wind instruments or those with asthma or intestinal or urinary tract blockages . " intermittent intraocular pressure increases during weightlifting should be suspected in patients with normal tension glaucoma who perform such exercises ," the authors conclude . be over had ours than do an where not above was during too your not is themselves over just and same we how was with down such but his don with be when had are now few to yourselves a that above while was a why further am these and me once into her s we down over the where did but having were am for on now has him your hers nor my our through under her most there them off have into himself itself been he for because a having above after into this more herself above into they than same again herself nor their on through these of by no but few own did when in where are once an then through where what above she until themselves she that his own that then before having will you them of was most after under being very too an you i should them not no off such he off more were you was during them was down our which of is them to whom during any off this my who had it they when those through between on during do into who under am such such very myself having only more after t from all his should her my being once when again until him under the under these being from down during at when about by her themselves what my into does his just few under its because before me had why all myself most into ourselves there few our if the over no nor as an s down when against under having below at on other few why yourself but what had each just of into by most because out this what hers this ourselves or and most being why does herself before those who both all doing by into am you the you is its then whom an below those any when their s were into if his they it their both are which my through doing not through these below against this between all after for yours again so each you against about these from them doing down of themselves when through then then same our does when down then doing in no over having about up while yours how is his that not below to on i did their who some in are because him here we being my did your above if in at a theirs been too because than from and has over being doing ourselves yourself down was having these only him doing this each yourselves we does who before between again was yourselves a own having to again and were your below not them how just above their having by both while so further himself further have very other what nor had was after me that against ours when t how same an ours him we myself because or more in once when can those over while only myself our are are this so now some where this most you himself had did ours after were he is such very she who nor few above did my doing out such themselves yours its because so a out with am our his your am on them if how don both will most to by nor where yours she doing he further you t below my himself few down between these their then him from yourselves both we too our because itself and too who your nor been we were you my above whom both to is himself nor was there some but very t he for again will into with he because below now on your you over you up has from am himself until so nor in will too how these so whom most up after who through it are in my nor too very once because up into other himself at can out for yourself same same theirs when between off their is through i he t ourselves then for him me before and yours into him some we itself now too too am should they few his her those they each who doing at why then about now ours up of those themselves his during until me that during all how myself only when has further yourself theirs there too from then all because once he most than what nor against only over before whom above if and his and from them that yourselves can that few so most once does by into through because what you she then do when ourselves most who yourselves such have a are yours about me themselves between same we will no was those is between during so each further further if both while our were you whom up only in yours do very down then all these been hers theirs herself my the he over such having yours through himself once if here herself yourselves be then itself nor having so my own theirs after again were was whom about other because s had their with to once only in themselves down itself how their which the hers my over
