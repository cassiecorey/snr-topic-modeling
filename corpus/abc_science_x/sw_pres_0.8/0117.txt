feeling ticklish ? most humans cannot tickle themselves because they anticipate their own actions , which alters their sense of perception , according to a new study . since it is now believed that a breakdown in this anticipation process may underlie the delusions in schizophrenia , the finding may also lead to a better understanding of this mental disorder . " it ' s well known that you can ' t tickle yourself ," says associate professor randy flanagan , one of the authors of the study published in the latest issue of the journal plos biology . " one explanation is that since all the sensations are completely predictable , we do ' sensory attenuation ', which reduces our touch perception ," says flanagan , a canadian psychologist at queen ' s university in ontario . " if we try to deal with all the sensory information directed at us at any given time , it ' s overwhelming . we can ' t focus attention on crucial changes in our environment that aren ' t a function of our own motions ." scientists previously speculated that we either filter out unnecessary information after the motion or sensation occurs , or that we predict our own actions . this would allow us to mostly ignore unnecessary sensations , such as the feel of our vocal chords while we speak , or the constant tapping of our fingers while typing at a keyboard . tap , tap to determine which of the two mechanisms is at work , the researchers asked 20 right - handed people to tap with one index finger on a force sensor that was sandwiched between the tapping finger and the other hand ' s passive index finger . with each finger tap , the sensor would deliver a tapping sensation to the passive finger . similar to self - tickling , the test subjects reported that the tap received by the passive finger was weak because they had anticipated the sensation . this occurred even when part of the force sensor was removed during surprise trials where the active finger just wound up tapping the air , while the passive finger still received the expected tap . " we are constantly predicting the consequences of our actions ," flanagan says . " when we act on ourselves and on the world around us we predict in real time as we move ." hearing voices flanagan also explains that a breakdown in this prediction process could be why people with delusional schizophrenia " hear voices " and mumble to themselves . " if a healthy person murmurs to himself , he knows that he is hearing his own voice ," flanagan says . " now imagine that the person has a deficit in the predictive mechanism . he murmurs and then suddenly hears murmuring but cannot label it as himself . as he tries to make sense of the alien voice , the explanation for it could be quite bizarre , such as thinking it is coming from a wall or the pavement ." he is not certain whether some people with schizophrenia can tickle themselves , but since their falsely alien sensations are often accompanied by feelings of fear and paranoia , it is likely that the experience would not be pleasurable . impressed chris frith , a professor of neuropsychology and deputy director of the leopold m & uuml ; ller functional imaging laboratory at university college london , says he is " very impressed " by the new study . both frith and flanagan hope that the findings will help people with schizophrenia , which the us national institute of mental health says affects around 51 million people worldwide . "[ we need ] robust techniques for measuring the magnitude of the [ prediction ] breakdown . if techniques like the one described in the plos biology paper can be used with patients , then this will have a major impact on diagnosis and the monitoring of the effects of treatment ," frith says . ourselves each whom and not up having down yours now themselves them then where only of any until when
