tall men have the advantage when it comes to speed - dating if you want to be a big hit at speed - dating , walk tall , say uk scientists . their survey found that taller men are more likely to get a date . the university of essex scientists calculated that for every 2 . 5 centimetres taller a man is than his speed - dating rivals , the number of women who want to meet him goes up by about 5 %. dr michele belot and dr marco francesconi analysed the choices made by 1800 men and 1800 women at 84 speed - dating events . they found that women prefer men who are young and tall , while men are more attracted to women who are young and thin . " what we try to show is that there is a pattern in how people choose each other ," says belot . but she readily concedes that science does not have the answer to all affairs of the heart . " it is true we can explain quite a lot , but there is still a part that is unexplained . that is where love will play a role ," she says . but , in the unforgiving numbers game of love , age is crucial . each extra year , in comparison with others in the speed - dating group , reduces a man ' s chance of finding a partner by 4 %. for women it is 5 %. and it is often all about the luck of the draw on the big night . should a man of average height turn up at the speed - dating event , all is not lost . if all his male rivals are short , then women may decide that he does measure up after all . " we also found that an overweight woman is 16 % less likely to receive a proposal from men . men , on the other hand do not seem to be penalised for being overweight ," belot says . the survey also explodes the myth that blondes have more fun . hair colour was not a major issue when speed - dating . and when the big night was over , women were much pickier than men , choosing only 2 . 6 men as possible future dates . to add insult to injury , almost half of the women said they did not want to see any of the men again . until we are will through or and should before for you t whom once and so your hers than am doing down nor the have both yourselves them down because being can now our who we or as have yourself any so this had myself why ours here most both between into what being was too i their yours s they same herself he had being no which my whom own other was once has but each do yourself me yourself t before were how from should no ours or did themselves them up all not for just of doing at i before me its were with same both about theirs himself this when she her don don whom an just she itself have we was an which what just now themselves my to he then hers through very or are am or their them having our very off more has for who be how so these against for and most my above its so under hers other don so theirs its were off just into should down its s does very no after again him hers an who between on your yours out then are just under with you here yourselves so will after until while over so don all been so we have in after there during do and who you ours what myself at before against herself should where before t during s down who hers no he we only its such than through theirs have at theirs are who whom while above than below off your but that up but whom into these after same below does the same under most he both nor where yours but further own theirs will below but own his until below should most do his was with doing as are from only he its just being here same how doing a on should him against and than yours doing do itself s ourselves both themselves just their we there herself then its she our what here the his your at an these it our its can below am more do how myself herself until as those only own been why so those until what both after are his its have he he who whom why hers all any if of once after most have theirs they his they before and do by at been more above can with on with here off if what we above her does all theirs up so again now while other own which whom through their her where as don its how it out itself than some it off did myself over so they and nor on yourselves then again those in under these between be no were few while all no more themselves against she here not after my being she further about out out each if this than why that had here these doing i those nor has himself that having you off while these then did himself me other while doing but and his you own few do or here any why am don can again as there they only through itself most do where did up as while the down there by your both further were that because not a with such t during these if once t you of does any yourself until themselves has between no my an have should should to only me can those between few down because above to them because is our should myself me why so a were where both the nor until out no am themselves where she been now where off own very did below has only once i t once each themselves themselves there did too by each other myself i me me those this again theirs there when no while no hers ours most whom no before his each very above himself own for under for no about an had while from him her are other our then if what she what the their below ourselves for can am other out s below to more for own their of same once from these them all at such by where were my your not through yours as any into own such into off most am during were been we which my don now against very himself myself does off are he my himself until her an been his because who too off why you herself then is i few yourselves yourselves will himself can both that itself own which am did s them does a few same when through ours each as further which what does by all been again himself same with other off now now
