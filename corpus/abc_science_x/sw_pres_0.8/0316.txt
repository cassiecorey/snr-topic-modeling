saturn ' s moon enceladus might have rolled or rotated itself to place an area of low density at the south pole . this illustrates the moon ' s interior , with warm , low - density material rising to the surface ( yellow ) from within or from its rocky core ( red ) millions of years ago , saturn ' s moon enceladus may have somersaulted in space , creating an ice - spewing hot spot on the moon ' s south pole , scientists suggest . for now , it is the only explanation why the small satellite sports a very active , though isolated , polar region . dr francis nimmo , an assistant professor at the university of california at santa cruz , and team publish their research today in the journal nature . during flybys of enceladus , the saturn - orbiting cassini probe has snapped pictures of gigantic icy plumes , indicating active geysers at the moon ' s south pole . researchers who have been studying images and other data collected by the cassini spacecraft believe a relatively warm blob of ice rose from beneath the moon ' s frozen surface . it could also have emerged from within its frigid and rocky core . less dense than the surrounding terrain , the blob would be more susceptible to saturn ' s powerful gravitational tug on enceladus , a grip that at one time seems to have caused the moon to roll over , says nimmo . the team calculated the effects of a low - density blob beneath the surface of enceladus and showed it could cause the moon to roll over by up to 30 & deg ; and put the blob at the pole . it may not have been a solitary incident either , nimmo says . " it could be like a lava lamp and each time a blob is reproduced , it causes the moon to flip ," he says . the manoeuver may not be all that uncommon . studies of magnetically charged particles around earth show evidence that the planet ' s north pole may at one time have resided elsewhere , nimmo adds . likewise , uranus ' s moon miranda shows evidence of multiple flips , he says . the researchers plan follow - up studies to look for more evidence . first , they want to carefully examine surface images for craters . the moon should be more heavily cratered in the areas that face its direction of travel . if enceladus flipped , it ' s current face should show fewer impacts than its trailing regions , which at one time may have been facing forward . the pull of gravity the team also would like to fly cassini low over enceladus ' southern pole to see if its gravitational pull is slightly weaker than at other parts of the moon . cassini would become the test object while radio antennas on earth track its movement during the flyby . a minute change in cassini ' s speed , perhaps as small as a centimetre per second , would be an indication of a lower - mass region at the pole . " it ' s a difficult measurement to make , but we ' d like to try ," nimmo says . scientists are not sure what mechanism fuels enceladus ' hot spot , but they believe it is tied to tidal forces from saturn and possibly a sister moon , janus . " you have this tiny moon blasting out a huge amount of heat ," nimmo says . " presumably it has to get squeezed . something is causing all this pushing and pulling . " it ' s astounding that cassini found a region of current geological activity on an icy moon that we would expect to be frigidly cold , especially down at this moon ' s equivalent of antarctica ," adds co - author dr robert pappalardo , a planetary scientist and assistant professor at nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory . our ourselves both of be theirs they be them just ours both nor below it
