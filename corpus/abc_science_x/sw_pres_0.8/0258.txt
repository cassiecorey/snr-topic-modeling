sitting in silence might be better for your heart turning off relaxing music and sitting in silence is better for your health , say italian and uk researchers . they found while slow meditative music induces a relaxing effect , it ' s the gap between the music that has greater benefits for your circulation system . dr luciano bernardi of the university of pavia and colleagues report their study in a recent issue of the journal heart . the research was part of a wider look at how heart rate , blood pressure and breathing rate fluctuate in response to music . bernardi and his team asked 24 men , half practising musicians , to listen to a random series of six 2 minute musical tracks . the tracks included raga , a type of indian music ; slow and fast classical music ; techno ; rap ; and dodecaphonic , or 12 - tone music that lacks a traditional rhythmic , harmonic and melodic structure . the researchers then measured their heart rate , breathing , blood pressure and other indicators of arousal or relaxation . they repeated the experiment inserting 2 minute periods of silence . the researchers found that most of the music increased blood pressure and heart rate , with a stronger effect seen with faster music . this effect did not appear to depend on the style of music . so , fast classical music and techno had the same effect . relaxing with music slow music produced a more relaxed affect , especially during the pauses . but during the silent interval , study participants ' heart and breathing rates and blood pressures fell further . "[ therefore ] music may give pleasure ( and perhaps a health benefit ) as a result of this controlled alternation between arousal and relaxation ," bernardi says . in musicians , the silent interval also reduced activity of the sympathetic nervous system , which triggers the ' fight or flight ' response . the musicians also had more pronounced shifts in heart rate and breathing when they heard the music , which the researcher says is probably associated with their ability to synchronise their breathing with the music phrase . listening to music may have effects similar to that of relaxation techniques , bernardi and his colleagues note . focus then release this generally requires a person to focus his or her attention on something and then release it . " appropriate selection of music , by alternating fast and slower rhythms and pauses , can be used to induce relaxation and reduce sympathetic activity and thus may be potentially useful in the management of cardiovascular disease ," the researchers conclude . you be you down his had ours who their theirs just for for as again below and we which if but being until very with are am if your
