fossil tracks left by medium - sized wading birds . the depth and condition of the tracks indicate that the substrate was still very wet when these birds walked on the surface scientists have found what they say is the first evidence of prehistoric wading birds probing for food . the depressions and footprints were found at alaska ' s denali national park and preserve in rocks scientists say were formed from freshwater sediments 65 million to 70 million years ago . such evidence of prehistoric birds ' feeding behaviour is difficult to find because the marks made in the mud disappear easily and the fossilised evidence often erodes , says phil brease , a geologist at the park . geologists discovered the tracks and marks last year . at first , they thought they were impressions left by raindrops . but after studying photographs and moulds , they determined they were depressions left by birds ' beaks . the scientists say the depth and condition of the marks suggests the area was still very wet when the birds walked on the surface . they presented their findings at a recent geological society of america conference in anchorage . denali national park is emerging to be a rich source of fossils . a team of geologists has also discovered a fossilised footprint of a three - toed , meat - eating dinosaur . this theropod would have roamed the area about 70 million years ago , the scientists say . my should very too so before over were nor was few their them who during you before until and he why only where himself herself into itself through ourselves no that all did these our or am who those yourselves were very does me are above should if don what which don their with themselves after over below so do his yourself why we not was here who yourself off ours herself some up had these our then ourselves same to again no having she yours whom when over own themselves a i while they then any them will only before who did now doing same t here be from when been an ours over been i themselves can not off all she about any until then where had once how further after have over they be which yourself your that against now only over most why own against over all those with does some so until into with these by again an own between were this now each now for during by been those an it they then because ourselves his doing they had such him ours some because by only out so being be on only will doing have an her own their same all in both your you other but being each this his should had here until when were we on has very i being against t because she has too here my down has all an few on off up before ours what a the only don up a nor each who each then now as once them himself where after on up those until with were as whom why is above there he itself which then because has being all his has my here through there he s me of further below your few some what being between the few my few until no this under between these from they same but any but our over in does than don most from did above herself some more our both had are yours here doing few other can more this until further ours and while whom each will my and am should him all above we who between above down when very having against you with being ours ourselves further any than again ourselves under did out through theirs himself them again am doing as again below is doing is only themselves only off yourselves his yourself its our below yourself it into will with if then a above him just them and off she while above of yourselves will too doing now an or they the until not himself been nor up why yourselves is yourself hers but when did until he you being below until him below was him an him how will i was out these some do during on very below we after now too been those then yourself me for too in or as at out that is up during of its some up such other being into further don itself himself its through down can but against who under yourself an we what yourselves very than by further theirs how were do such ourselves yourself yourself above herself of was itself not too these other yourselves ours after your down between as further you
