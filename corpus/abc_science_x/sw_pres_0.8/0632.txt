this mock - up illustrates the dangers foxes pose to penguins on phillip island a drug that makes vixens neglect their cubs could help solve australia ' s feral fox problem , researchers say . they are looking at the drug cabergoline , which reduces fertility and interferes with maternal instincts , to see if it could control foxes on phillip island in victoria . the island is home to a renowned penguin colony and up to 150 unwanted foxes . a fox can kill up to 30 penguins a night , says dr roger kirkwood , a biologist at the phillip island nature park . " we need to eradicate foxes from the island because just one fox can step in there and do so much damage ," he says . the foxes also feast on migratory mutton birds that visit the island , says kirkwood . he ' s working with university of tasmania pharmacologist professor stuart mclean to study cabergoline . in humans , the drug is used to treat parkinson ' s disease . but the scientists are interested in using the drug in foxes as it acts on the brain ' s dopamine receptors to block secretion of the hormone prolactin . "[ foxes ] rely on prolactin to become pregnant and maintain pregnancy and to lactate , and also for their mothering instinct after the cubs are born ," says mclean . because it suppresses maternal instincts , cabergoline makes vixens less likely to care for their cubs by bringing them food , grooming them and teaching them survival skills , which reduces their chances of survival . the drug has not yet been tested on foxes on the island but preliminary research will be presented at the australian health and medical research congress next month . a study looking at how long cabergoline remains in fox bait has also been submitted to the journal wildlife research . toll on penguins kirkwood says if foxes are allowed to breed out of control they could destroy phillip island ' s 60 , 000 strong penguin population . foxes have already reduced the number of penguin colonies on phillip island from 12 to just one in the past 80 years . more than 1000 foxes have been eliminated since the introduction of a control program on the island in 1980 , which includes shooting , poisoning , fumigating dens and using dogs to hunt the foxes . kirkwood says although foxes only live about five years the population is resilient and recovers quickly . " if we stopped our program we reckon the carrying capacity of the island would be over 400 foxes , and they would eliminate the penguins given time if we didn ' t control them ," he says . after by
