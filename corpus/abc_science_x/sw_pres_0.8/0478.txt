can technology solve airport security issues ? or is a permanent ban on hand luggage the answer ? new technology to screen passengers and hand luggage for explosives is needed , say analysts after last week ' s airport security alert . " quite frankly , metal detectors and x - ray don ' t cut it ," says chris yates , aviation security expert at jane ' s information group . " we need to invest . we need to get money into the checkpoint . we need to reassess how we do it ... perhaps this is the final wake - up call to actually shake the decision makers from their lethargy ." current airport security typically involves a five - layered process of screening checked - in luggage , with multiple x - rays and ct scans . that is too unwieldy and time - consuming to apply to passengers and their hand luggage . instead travellers pass through a metal detector gateway and their bags through an x - ray machine , with a random sample also checked for explosives residue using trace particle detectors . what would it take to be able to check all passengers and bags for explosives ? " it ' s something which i would imagine could only be solved with either sniffer dogs or electronic sniffers and hand searching . it ' s a very significant undertaking to do that at somewhere like heathrow airport ," says david claridge , managing director of janusian security risk management in london . jane ' s analyst yates says new technology is becoming available , such as quadrupole resonance scanning developed by australian - based qr sciences , which uses radio waves to stimulate certain atoms such as nitrogen , present in explosives . its scanner , with a traffic - light display to indicate all - clear , further investigation or danger , has already been trialled internationally , including at manchester airport . rolling out such technology universally would require time and a huge reallocation of investment which until now has gone into other areas , such as deployment of sky marshals on planes . liquid explosives an al qaeda plot to blow up airliners with liquid explosives was uncovered as far back as 1995 . but authorities have never previously banned people from carrying fluids , such as toiletries , onto planes as happened last week . though police have given no further details , security analysts say there were indications they were concerned about militants setting off a liquid explosive such as nitroglycerine with some form of non - metal detonator , or combining otherwise harmless liquids on board a plane to produce an explosive mix . the future of hand luggage in the meantime , yates says he expects the current restrictions on hand baggage to continue , at least for flights into and out of the uk , possibly for months . he says a permanent ban on hand luggage would be untenable , not least because of the risk of theft from luggage carousels . but not everyone rules out such radical solutions . " i reckon the days of carry - on luggage are gone ," says maxim worcester , managing director of control risks consultancy in germany . " it ' s the easiest way of solving the problem , isn ' t it ?" did t himself or or above such with there have me its as doing no for no an such of with yourselves again were yourselves been they
