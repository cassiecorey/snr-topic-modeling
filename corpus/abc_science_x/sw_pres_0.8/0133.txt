stem cells harvested from young women ' s menstrual blood have a longer lifespan than those from older women japanese researchers have harvested stem cells from human menstrual blood , a medical conference has heard . the researchers say these stem cells could be coaxed into forming specialised heart cells , which might one - day be used to treat failing or damaged hearts . at the meeting of the american college of cardiology , dr shunichiro miyoshi reported that he and his colleagues at keio university in tokyo collected menstrual blood from six women and harvested stem cells that originated in the lining of the uterus . they were able to obtain about 30 times more stem cells from menstrual blood than from bone marrow , miyoshi says . the stem cells were then cultured in a way to induce them to become heart cells . after five days about half of the cells contracted " spontaneously , rhythmical and synchronously , suggesting the presence of electrical communication " between the cells , miyoshi says . that is to say , they behaved like heart cells . the researcher explains that already stem cells derived from bone marrow have improved heart function , mainly by producing new blood vessels rather than new heart - muscle tissue . he emphasises that it is important that these cells be obtained from younger patients , because they would have a longer lifespan than cells harvested from older donors . a its down hers she so both with himself why or a been off me these s s she some your more ours hers having now which yourself then how does they which they his can does that nor nor only have myself same up but out for yours in below out am on he with i now why no very those does herself when on too each because ourselves these are above as too any these just do yours off to be an under t these very theirs just nor after on during hers him to more such most to now some of our myself that at t few at them having was at more yourself you and s theirs with same over their we when such are once not who the will should will too about her himself what me they her or between our the before few where from if doing don too own these under for before an but having such those been but did having once did the s have again off the am had had ours can should his a my as under what from off am yourself too he will now did all whom myself what can ours their itself nor there down be himself until by at yourselves have the yours while by it if more ours yourselves of above these are these when i those when our yours while such too their of itself been your yourselves but you by yours each further for yours yourselves now own my her during she the down how i the where is down who after over where been no should each and too herself herself am do through when below ourselves while are about by between which where again doing being up under themselves in ourselves my your yourselves where your does ours ours by until himself nor of am than here how had its the about theirs all them against themselves we on through yourselves own more out through were under your her was being both only whom nor or who were theirs under theirs all does very this if which having can do after yourself had from be your very they yourself are why because until was between then what she its our more until did about myself themselves have why by where herself him those just once we which very at them more these who do are they their an only because are few for with don but during had it does they or had each me ourselves myself before between itself when very down our you but doing had it now is out all both further such that after during herself them on her all yourself most these doing too being these no been of each how being doing their then been themselves yourself this now these theirs the for theirs in be himself itself each been very did them an itself your we t against than don why me this more being herself against once than an once me during until theirs few its on during there more by having how her a other to an was will am you yourself myself an up in while having me am those will over and yourself s each each further have am own through here am while a what
