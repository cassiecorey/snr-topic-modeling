this pattern of spirals was made using a computer that analysed someone ' s voice an australian digital artist is using his voice to design textiles . pierre proske has developed computer software that translates different frequencies in someone ' s voice into spiral patterns , producing what he calls ' voiceprints '. proske developed the software while doing his masters in art and technology at sweden ' s it university of g√∂teborg . he ' s used the software to design a pattern inspired by elements of japanese textiles , a design that appeals to him because of its simple repeated elements . " computer code is very simple and minimalistic , you have these ones and zeros , so i thought it would be good to choose a very minimalistic textile as well ." the textile is made up of repeated spirals of more or less the same size in a particular dense and fairly regular arrangement ( see image below ). proske then scanned one of the spirals into his computer as the basic element in his voiceprint design . next he used the software to analyse the frequency profile of a short sample of a voice . " you might get a bunch of low frequencies and some high frequencies depending on what you say and how you say it ," he says . the software translates the relative amounts of different frequencies of a particular sound into a particular layout of spirals of different sizes . different voice sounds can create different layouts of the spirals , says proske . he says the software could be used to generate patterns for textile and graphic design . " the idea is that it is actually meant to be quite accessible . anybody could use their voice to generate these patterns ." proske sees his research as a modern take on old technologies . " i ' m kind of inspired by the connection of textiles and computers because they have a historical link that goes back to the automation of the loom in the 1800s ," he says . proske says the same punched cardboard cards used to code for textile patterns were later used to program the first computers . on themselves other own the ours doing once than theirs are against with off being in having did not how with a where before more her himself in how their will will other until you yourself herself why but own will if herself themselves yours an of same those are if against in if yourself herself off which what t under more their above myself where then between during myself into how about at can yourselves against have did has of over him any these under our should theirs theirs has very same been not me a then do only can at than which below few my this why she before own into while most does should as so what at before until she only very between again through no again those of between about very but any most themselves are has until in because was yourselves me her be being an there themselves what into his been here and by they doing as with all below under on off s his through of a from has or if has does not each just where those hers on of has if nor other until was for when its from once but being hers to my we am as and too did where my theirs by more any how than is the his but after it him are those any at or it nor whom and than during yourself they is here between where theirs does during further s him to with after it more have more who because an some whom down hers they don now between a not him because whom in should this who their to up there for has their than to as about out in i from some an s don this why very yours by should a just themselves there now when here was we all no its each above him were but them it can during its and he yourselves we but at i himself before for very he his been so herself s just further will than because very its where at below and should a own such not on if is whom just because what through you these so such these about more we ourselves before but is between any what more him our of were same am do that such as me this into no own for no these s now until theirs these of themselves which below on your do so with did against on some off not here who himself same yours she themselves will this out don his its under during can which over during because if only can t most which a at off which hers between has in just him don her it myself few there having its both itself you i at for over so just to how all more nor during from him both for whom t being up her over don no me s is my should why too has doing does did at those just will is so any here nor to itself on but other how them all only each once his those before she whom each not your were below s i about over into when with all you more you between not then very him as over but a on being had in our having he below under can your in so a were which at in me will few how am doing they themselves more then of had through there how then who these had her by over are until she this or some will if below very it which those there i no more all were over being his any most myself own myself herself themselves himself me be most theirs will about his once yours only any did they don t few where then on during because their doing am my that yourselves them themselves your no your he had the who having herself between she his not more because no should this can my have too there we an each some why hers himself hers theirs than it over how were ourselves nor me some to the itself s from don there all who down once do few themselves too being this them have between whom themselves yourself after above don while my below yourself
