new research shows that the outermost layer of the atmosphere will lose 3 % of its density over the coming decade , a sign of the far - reaching impacts of greenhouse gas emissions . as the density declines , orbiting satellites and space junk will experience less drag human increases in carbon dioxide emissions are thinning the earth ' s outer atmosphere , making it easier to keep the space station aloft but prolonging the life of dangerous space junk , scientists say . " it ' s a bit of a two - edge sword ," says stanley solomon , a us scientist at the national center for atmospheric research in boulder , colorado . " in the future , it will be a little bit easier to keep the space station , for instance , in orbit . it will need a little bit less fuel ," he says . " on the other hand , it will give space junk a much longer lifetime ," he told a meeting of the american geophysical union in san francisco . solomon is the co - author of a study presented this week that found the burning of fossil fuels and increase of carbon dioxide emissions will make the earth ' s outer atmosphere above 100 kilometres 3 % less dense by 2017 . the study , which is also published in the journal geophysical research letters , found a decrease in density of about 5 % between 1970 and 2000 . although scientists say that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming closer to earth ' s surface , in the thinner outer atmosphere where spacecraft orbit , a cooling effect takes place . solar activity also affects the outer atmosphere . as this outermost region becomes less dense , it produces less drag on satellites , spacecraft and tens of thousands of pieces of discarded space debris from previous missions orbiting at about 400 kilometres from earth ' s surface . " these objects are now experiencing less drag proportionally than they did 30 years ago ," solomon says . a steady stream of space launches since sputnik ' s in 1957 has left about 10 , 000 orbiting objects bigger than the size of a grapefruit , and 100 , 000 larger than a centimetre , says dr kent tobiska , president and chief scientist of space environment technologies in pacific palisades , california . the international space station now in orbit must readjust its path several times a year to avoid colliding with such debris ; a chance hit with a spacewalking astronaut could prove fatal
