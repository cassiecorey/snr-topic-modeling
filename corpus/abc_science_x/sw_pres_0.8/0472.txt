the study relied on over 50 ice cores collected from a range of locations around antarctica a new study that shows antarctic snowfalls have changed little in 50 years , despite global warming , could be evidence that the worst is yet to come , says one of the authors . a study published today in the journal science reports that , contrary to expectations , snowfall in antarctica has not increased over the past 50 years . this contradicts the predictions of most climate models that are based on the assumption that warming air can carry more moisture and produce greater snowfalls at the poles . " the models predict that antarctic snowfall should be increasing with a warming atmosphere ," says australian team member and palaeoclimatologist dr ian goodwin , of the university of newcastle . goodwin doesn ' t challenge this basic climate physics . but says the recent evidence supports the idea , not recognised in climate models , that there is a lag between global warming and antarctica ' s response to it . the reason is that antarctica and the southern hemisphere are surrounded by large oceans that take a long time to heat and therefore act as a buffer to climate change . recent evidence suggests the lag time could be up to 60 years , says goodwin . " we can be relatively complacent about the effects of climate change in the southern hemisphere because we haven ' t seen dramatic changes ," he says . " but the frightening thing i think is that we are not yet seeing the full impact of global warming in the southern hemisphere . but it ' s just around the corner ." natural cycles goodwin and colleagues published a study in 1991 that showed an increase in snowfall in east antarctica . but , the new study shows that since then , the amount of snow falling in that area has decreased . goodwin and colleagues used direct measurement of snowfall and more than 50 ice cores to reconstruct annual snowfall over the past 50 years . he says the study demonstrates a previously unknown natural climate cycle , affecting the whole of antarctica . " on one side of antarctica in some decades we see an increase in accumulation [ of snow ] and on the other side of antarctica we see a decrease and so it balances out to zero net gain ," he says . goodwin says this variability is so great it could mask any changes due to global warming . but , he says , it could only be a matter of time before the natural cycle becomes dwarfed by the changes brought about by global warming . and this is where he says the lag time becomes important . " if we were to rewrite this paper in say 10 years time the likelihood is that we will be actually be writing a paper that says ' significant change in antarctic snowfall over the last 10 to 15 years '," says goodwin . " in all likelihood we ' re about to see , in the next couple of decades , a very large response to global warming in antarctic and southern ocean regions ." goodwin says that the new research should now feed into climate models and make them more accurate . than don yours by a t but doing further me she under be what while doing both same ours again from not me other out off if or into few don
