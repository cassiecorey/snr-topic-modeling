no longer the ninth planet : an artist ' s impression of pluto and its moon charon this week ' s surprise decision to strip pluto of its planet status has triggered a universe of reactions from astronomers , some philosophical , others downright shocked . after heated debate among members of a 2500 - strong meeting of the international astronomical union ( iau ) in prague , pluto has been redefined as a ' dwarf planet '. it is now considered a distinct object from the other eight traditional planets of the solar system : mercury , venus , earth , mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune . australian astronomer dr simon johnston , from the parkes observatory in new south wales is shocked at the decision . " up to a week ago i thought we had 12 planets ," he says , referring to a definition released by the iau last week that would have expanded rather than reduced the number of planets . the overseer of science investigations on nasa ' s new horizons mission to pluto calls the reclassification rash and illogical . " i think people are going to consider pluto a planet regardless ," says dr alan stern of the southwest research institute in boulder , colorado . " what they did was scientifically ludicrous and publicly embarrassing ," he says . " pluto is a planet with clouds , weather and geology ." philosophical but other astronomers are more philosophical , including dr mike brown of the california institute of technology . " pluto is dead ," says brown , who in 2003 discovered an object larger than pluto that many claimed was the 10th planet brown now accepts the icy rock , called 2003 ub313 and nicknamed xena , will also be categorised as a mere dwarf planet under the new definition . " pluto would never be considered a planet if it were discovered today , and i think the fact that we ' ve now found one kuiper - belt object bigger than pluto underscores its shaky status ," says brown . " i ' m of course disappointed that xena will not be the 10th planet , but i definitely support the iau in this difficult and courageous decision ," he says . " it is scientifically the right thing to do , and is a great step forward in astronomy ." several johns hopkins university astronomers describe the decision as a " muddled " ruling that is unlikely to settle ongoing debates over how to define a planet and whether the term should apply to pluto . in an informal poll , only one astronomer was pleased to hear about pluto ' s new status . but at least one astronomer appears indifferent to the decision . " the classification doesn ' t matter ," says dr louis friedman , executive director of the planetary society . " pluto , and all solar system objects , are mysterious and exciting new worlds that need to be explored and better understood ." pluto fails the test pluto ' s status has been contested for many years by astronomers who say its tiny size and highly eccentric orbit precludes it from joining the other acknowledged planets . this discovery of xena prompted questions as to whether pluto and other largish objects could be considered planets or just simply rocks - rubble left over from the formation of the solar system . the iau defined the core difference between a planet and a dwarf planet as whether the celestial object has " cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit " - in other words , whether the object is massive enough to wield a gravity that draws in rocks and other debris that may clutter its orbital path . this criterion disqualified pluto whose egg - shaped orbit overlaps neptune ' s . the scientists also agreed that , to be called a planet , a celestial body must be massive enough for its own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape , and it must orbit around a star while not itself being a star . the large asteroid ceres , along with pluto and xena , will also be defined as a dwarf planet . this is , according to the iau , an important new class of trans - neptunian objects . around a dozen other objects are already dwarf candidates and all other objects , except satellites , will be known as " small solar system bodies " under the new definition . hate mail from angry children pluto was discovered in 1930 by a 24 - year - old american astronomer , clyde tombaugh who died in january 1997 , convinced he had achieved eternal recognition as the discoverer of the solar system ' s ninth planet . tombaugh ' s announcement smashed the perceived boundaries of the solar system , established 84 years earlier with the discovery of neptune . this week ' s prague vote will have similarly widespread public implications with models and textbooks of the solar system becoming instantly obsolete . officials at the american museum of natural history in new york , who have been at the vanguard of the movement to demote pluto , say they have already received irate calls from the public . " we had enormous numbers of telephone calls and i would say things that verged on hate mail from second - graders - very angry children who said , ' what have you done ? this is the cutest , most disney - esque of the planets . how could you possibly demote it ?'" says dr michael shara , the museum ' s astrophysics curator . " it ' s going to be a difficult thing to accept at first , but we will accept it eventually , and that ' s the right scientific and cultural thing to do ," says brown . but at least one young visitor to the smithsonian institution ' s national air and space museum , 15 - year - old quinn huebner , is happy . " it ' s one less planet to memorise ," he says . an against or you in where that through what she a doing should i your why over her further my this her at by after of than s out only both that too
