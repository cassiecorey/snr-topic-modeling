the new spaceships are meant to replace the space shuttle fleet to be retired in 2010 europe ' s first probe to the moon crashed into the lunar surface at the weekend giving stargazers around the world an astronomical fireworks display . scientists hope that dust kicked up by the impact of the european space agency ( esa ) probe will tell them more about the moon ' s origin . the smart - 1 probe smashed into a plain called the lake of excellence on the southwestern side of the moon ' s face , " producing a more intense flash than expected ", says the mission ' s chief scientist professor bernard foing . the craft plunged to the surface at a speed of 2 kilometres per second , throwing up a cloud of dust . esa estimates that the impact would leave a crater measuring 3 - 10 metres in diameter and 1 metre deep . over the past three years , operating with a full - time staff of just seven and a total budget equivalent to us $ 151 million dollars , the little probe has been testing new technology that one day could help put humans on mars . scientists also say that the 20 , 000 detailed photos transmitted by the craft will yield a fresh look at the moon , revealing earth ' s satellite as a place of surprising complexity and promise rather than a lifeless rock with little to offer except grey dust . " smart - 1 is the vanguard " of future space missions , says the craft ' s operations manager , octavio camino - ramos . " almost everything on board was innovative . it was a mission to test technology ; the science was an extra plus ." ion thruster an ion thruster engine has propelled the cube , which measured just 1 metre across and weighed 350 kilograms , since it was launched in september 2003 . the engine type has only been used once before , with the us craft deep space 1 , launched in 1998 to rendezvous with an asteroid and then a comet . ion engines are fuelled by xenon gas . the gas atoms are charged by electric guns powered by solar panels and are then expelled from the rear of the spacecraft , delivering a tiny thrust , visible as a ghostly blue glow . chemical engines burn out after a couple of minutes , whereas an ion engine can push on gently for months or even years , for so long as the sun shines and the small supply of propellant lasts . smart - 1 travelled 100 million kilometres but used just 80 kilograms ( 50 litres ) of fuel , an extraordinary feat in space exploration standards . but unlike the deep space mission ' s essentially straight - line trajectories , smart - 1 had to carry out a complex series of manoeuvres to slowly but relentlessly build up speed . it had to loop again and again around the earth to gain extra speed yet also juggle with the moon ' s gravitational tug , all the time using a tiny engine that delivered the same power as someone picking up an a4 sheet of paper . camino says the experience was " an adventure ," and compared it to navigating a small sailboat buffeted by swirling winds and currents . but the tiny thruster needed 14 months for a trip that took apollo only three days . " we have shown that ion propulsion works ," camino says , predicting that this will be the thruster of choice for two esa missions in the next decade : bepicolombo , to explore mercury , and solar orbiter , which will swoop close to the sun . and it is also likely to be the propulsion for hauling big cargo containers to the moon to help build the first lunar settlement , or to mars , to support the first manned mission there , he says . small package other smart - 1 innovations are a new communications system , new - generation solar panels and a package of sensors and scanners that foing hails as " a miracle of miniaturisation - seven instruments weighing just 19 kilos ". weighing as little as a 10th of conventional instruments carried aboard space probes , smart ' s x - ray telescope and infrared spectrometer have been carrying out the most detailed map of the moon ' s elements and minerals , says foing . smart - 1 has also sought out locations at the lunar poles that are in permanent shade and could be worth exploring if , as some scientists hope , water exists on the moon or just below its surface . or had will what than themselves those of but until themselves it being
