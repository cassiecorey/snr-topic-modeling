just like her screen depiction by movie star elizabeth taylor , cleopatra knew all about power hair egyptian queen cleopatra used her hairstyles to enhance her power and fame , says a professor of art history and classics . statues , coins and other existing depictions of the queen suggest cleopatra ( 69 - 30 bc ) wore at least three hairstyles , professor diana kleiner of yale university says in a new book . the first , a " travelling " do that mimicked the hair of a macedonian greek queen , involved sectioning the hair into curls , which were then often pulled away from the face and gathered into a bun at the back . the next was a coiffure resembling a melon , and the third was the regal cleopatra in her royal egyptian headdress , complete with a rearing cobra made of precious metal . cleopatra did not invent any of these styles , but she used them to her advantage , kleiner indicates in her book cleopatra and rome . ptolemaic trendsetters from the time of egyptian king ptolemy i , the ptolemaic queens wore the ' melon hairstyle ' with its segmented sections resembling a melon or gourd ," kleiner says . " when cleopatra followed suit , she was more traditionalist than trendsetter . " these same ptolemaic queens were also depicted in art with the usual egyptian wigged headdress that had its origins in pharaonic times . " cleopatra did as well , so again she followed tradition and did not innovate when it came to hair ." " but ," kleiner says , " cleopatra appears to have worn different coiffures in different circumstances , playing to her audience , so to speak , in life and in art ." kleiner says when the queen was in her homeland , her likely objective was to look like a traditional egyptian ruler , although she was in fact greek , and to legitimise the ptolemaic dynasty by linking it to the time of the pharaohs . a group of egyptian statues recently has been linked to cleopatra , although the identification can ' t be proved since there are no accompanying inscriptions . " these show her with the customary egyptian wig and the triple uraeus ( rearing cobra )," she says . " this egyptian coiffure is the one we most often associate with cleopatra today . think elizabeth taylor !" divine ornaments the uraeus was associated with a cobra goddess wadjyt , the sun god ra and the goddess hathor , so wearing it signified that the individual had taken on the attributes of a divinity . cleopatra also probably often wore the melon hairstyle in egypt , where she had many slaves to attend to her appearance , including some that were responsible for maintaining the royal wigs . the egyptian queen extensively travelled , and did so in style . not unlike film depictions , cleopatra would arrive via elegant barge with her attendants catering to her every need . in rome , kleiner believes cleopatra wore her " hellenistic travelling coiffure " in places where it would be seen and " gossiped about at cocktail parties ." at about the same time , kleiner notes the melon hairstyle turns up in roman portraiture , which suggests roman women admired cleopatra and attempted to copy her . nodus operandi roman leaders octavian , antony and julius caesar seduced the egyptian queen . kleiner suggests that octavia , antony ' s wife , invented a hairstyle called " the nodus " to compete with cleopatra . the nodus featured a roll over the forehead that kleiner says may have mimicked cleopatra ' s well - known rearing cobra . the nodus was the height of roman fashion in the 30s bc , just before cleopatra ' s death by suicide at the age of 39 . karl galinsky , distinguished professor of classics at the university of texas at austin , says he agrees that cleopatra wore different looks , including calculated hairstyles . he says they were designed to convey a message and cleopatra may have had different hair days in different countries . too each does too off them
