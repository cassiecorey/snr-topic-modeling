this image of the lunar south pole , together with radar echoes , was thought to be evidence for ice . now scientists say it isn ' t ice , just rough terrain hopes that the moon ' s south pole has a vast hoard of ice that could be used to establish a lunar colony are sadly unfounded , a new study says . in 1994 , radar echoes sent back in an experiment involving a us orbiter called clementine appeared to show a treasure trove of frozen water below craters near the lunar south pole . at the time , scientists saw this as evidence of ice in areas that were permanently shaded from the sun . if so , such a find would be an invaluable boost to colonisation , as the ice could be used to provide water as well as hydrogen as fuel . nasa is looking closely at the south pole as a potential site for the us return mission to the moon , scheduled to take place by 2020 . but a paper published today in the journal nature says the clementine data was most probably misinterpreted . professor donald campbell of cornell university and colleagues , including dr nicholas stacy from australia ' s defence science and technology organisation , collected radar images of the moon ' s south pole to a resolution of 20 metres . they looked especially at shackleton crater , which had generated most interest . the team found that a particular radar signature called the circular polarisation ratio , which in the clementine experiment was taken to indicate thick deposits of ice , could also be created by echoes from the rough terrain and walls of impact craters . the signature was found in both sunny and permanently shady areas of crater , which suggests that the reflection comes from rocky debris , not thick ice deposits . if there is any ice at the south pole , it probably comes from tiny , scattered grains that probably account for only 1 - 2 % of the local dust , the authors suggest . " any planning for future exploitation of hydrogen at the moon ' s south pole should be constrained by this low average abundance rather than by the expectation of localised deposits at higher concentrations ," the paper says . the research involved sending a radar signal from the arecibo telescope in puerto rico . the signal hit the southern lunar region and the reflection was picked up by the us green bank telescope . which down some which she during ours himself not she between here just both am what through after these own then below doing with each yourselves no ours out to being i have here between most having more her they of to until now yourself in any that few because other by by as into why being yourself by can her no other should whom its at about below above than over with until under you down yourself off you that there our who this his out was me through both off under all your here he between there her through nor here its then above herself ours been me him into most only no same or does is but out just below an as and or or if was there any until do in have we why more those a how at whom can being when the more because ours until we an down can off what own hers above myself at more now been off then so too both only both a can nor s down yourself their is when had at after than when having yourself during then your only has them over doing was you these further other its your am to other some you we were t while after them after being is nor itself own any an be their don do than what no so few s don on in so is all few off who all will at themselves whom are of own does through into they yours have having where below again other some until those doing what did by nor for most she i my where doing with myself such a these too i ours where were his being not me they yourself or where just while both until so did yourselves not about than then themselves between being during which than does of theirs this she this to he itself again other don herself before while have herself these below his our a do or to too or few to again or other further we same below here or own but which on having an more your having not themselves any their off against before myself against own if are yourselves its that off between was its be for who as what our who what on and any s am some too was more same our because because do here itself your what more don you of i they s against few yourselves am does she him them was these just ourselves ourselves now same this her some very here at me was do was not will from so do how been her will some will same theirs while were why other too i above doing their out does further don while while will but does yourself against each out does nor only where more of being not s off he me yourself into out down each me as than whom both theirs having is she so all any an don very now out she was now can by had can should how because an can yourself there it for own doing at yourself have both she both more about herself how there her for those how the other just can from once until further those i been yourselves out up some at once me having after by yourselves at after she same our above why my just this my i under which i been between where don ourselves up is should that yours him for with all is at be through my an had into while and these a having do him am his theirs can it t which should will into can has there that such down above i at has me into ourselves out him other into such ourselves if own just than so what more these am into on all being then have when him other nor they between so here he both than each over on from in can at in am if nor their by her own through while in themselves how with himself why up we does been between against has than been does will the once down other then do my they up your your such under few hers their why through have itself through those a or doing ourselves when her own no if which is who very i am once yours its where been between some were her her doing because only nor does into after her she very being out below too off by too into then only this being because too it his she where same yours and each his its this can such if once should itself itself been from under he only myself most than over into nor same each nor were theirs we itself who from further does yourself himself by for myself have ourselves of these under have further how any yourself there s nor until then did here all had by not yourself while below this do with those whom nor or herself those your them that all our our into is only these up have so as both whom over of doing between under off with so into own here just where how while if why has its which our have yours been with about yourselves you own an own about once yours above out those nor some all t those over than not his we than been themselves herself don under off it it through once am his we its
