the study showed children who stuttered showed greater emotional " reactivity " to everyday stresses , like having a toy taken away preschoolers who stutter may have more difficulty controlling their emotions than other children their age , a study has found - suggesting that emotional factors contribute to the speech disorder . dr edward conture , a us professor of hearing and speech sciences at vanderbilt university in nashville and colleagues will report their findings in the journal of communication disorders . stuttering is a common speech problem that typically becomes apparent between the ages of 2 and 5 years old . children may repeat or draw out words or parts of words , or have difficulty beginning a word . the exact cause of stuttering is unknown , but it probably involves a " complex interaction " between genes and environment , says conture . stuttering is believed to have a strong genetic component , as it often runs in families . but it has also long been suspected that emotional development may contribute to the disorder , says conture . his team found that preschoolers who stuttered were typically more excitable than their peers with normal speech , and tended to have a harder time calming down or shifting their attention away from a stressful situation . the findings are based on reports from parents of 65 preschoolers who stuttered and 56 children who did not . both groups of parents completed a standardised questionnaire on child behaviour . three general differences between the two groups emerged , conture says . children who stuttered showed greater emotional " reactivity " to everyday stresses , like having a toy taken away ; it took them longer to settle down once they were excited or upset ; and they were less adept at shifting their attention away from the stressor , often becoming fixated on it instead . the researchers suspect that poor attentional control , leading to higher levels of emotional reactivity may contribute to the development of stuttering in children who are predisposed to the speech problem . findings support parents ' observations conture says the findings are in line with what parents often tell their child ' s doctor or speech therapist : that emotional outbursts or excitement seem to trigger stuttering episodes . he says parents should tell their health care provider if they notice that their child regularly has strong emotional reactions to everyday challenges or changes in their daily routine . parents may be able to help their child by demonstrating ways to calmly cope with stressful situations , says conture . he also notes that children can have difficulty controlling not only negative emotions , but excitement over positive events as well ; so it may not be a good idea , he said , to tell your child about a trip to somewhere exciting months beforehand . no one knows yet whether helping children better regulate their emotions will aid their stuttering problems , but conture says the current findings " tell us this is something we should look at ." he also emphasises that parents should not feel guilty about any role emotional control might play in stuttering . " there is no evidence that parents cause their children to stutter ," conture says . just such both as in himself between until once between under same because has she through up after her these
