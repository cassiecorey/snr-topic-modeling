the protein soup that makes up semen can trigger serious allergic reactions in some women women can become allergic to their partners or other men , according to new research presented this week at a us conference . the culprit is semen , reports dr david resnick , acting director of the division of allergy at the new york presbyterian hospital . his research is due to be presented at the annual meeting of the american college of allergy , asthma and immunology in philadelphia . it isn ' t sperm but its accompanying proteins that can cause an allergic response , a phenomenon that allergy experts are recognising more often , he says . while there have been no reported deaths from an allergic response to semen , some women may require hospitalisation after experiencing difficulty breathing , hives and swelling . less severe cases may result in itching , burning and swelling after intercourse . more women may have the reaction than are aware of it , says resnick . " some women think there ' s another problem [ such as an infection or condom allergy ]," resnick says . "[ but ] in one survey , out of 1073 women who sought related information from a researcher , approximately 13 % were determined to have a semen allergy ." sufferers , resnick explains , produce an antibody that recognises the proteins in a partner ' s semen . the antibody triggers a powerful immune response , similar in mild cases to hay fever . some women are only allergic to the semen of a certain partner , but others react to multiple men . other allergens can be transmitted through the seminal fluid . these include medications such as penicillin , and even some foods and beverages , such as walnuts and soft drinks . women with other allergies tend to be more prone to semen allergies . what can we do about it ? two basic types of treatment are available . the first is similar to standard allergy treatments that expose a sufferer to the allergen in diluted doses . the second involves removing other proteins known to sometimes interfere with the desensitisation process from the semen plasma , and then injecting a small amount of the processed semen at regular intervals . in both cases , frequent sexual contact is needed after the treatment . " we actually had one case where the male spouse was unable to engage in such frequent intercourse , so his wife developed the allergy again ," says resnick . jonathan bernstein , a professor of medicine at the university of cincinnati , and one of the world ' s leading experts on semen allergies , says he agrees with resnick . but he believes that the processed semen , though a more expensive treatment , would be more effective . bernstein also believes the allergy is probably underreported . " it may not be as rare as people think ," he says . " the allergy may go unrecognised , yet it can have a significant effect on relationships ." don their himself yourself between which down been t yours at my through own it been have where the s below
