our ability to count emerged in stages , linguists say . the latest evolutionary stage allowed us to name lanes on a racetrack 1 , 2 and 3 as well as describe which runner came in 1st , 2nd or 3rd we can thank our verbal nature , along with our fingers , for the ability to develop complex number systems , a new study suggests . the authors theorise that language and maths co - evolved in humans , with language probably emerging just ahead of basic mathematical concepts . " i do not think counting words were among the first words spoken by our species , because their application makes use of a fairly sophisticated pattern of linking that occurred ... relatively late in linguistic evolution ," says author dr heike wiese , whose study has been accepted for publication in the journal lingua . wiese , a linguist at the university of potsdam in germany , says that our use of counting words , and numbers in general , probably emerged in four stages . during the first stage , wiese believes humans began using visual representations , such as symbols or other markings , to correspond with verbal indications of quantity . among the early evidence for that stage is a 30 , 000 - year - old wolf bone , excavated in the czech republic , with notched tallies cut into it . the second stage of development , according to the new study , was the evolution of finger counting . our hands are like a built - in abacus : the physiology that allows us to bend fingers individually also allowed the emergence of our ability to count in sequence . during the third stage , wiese thinks emphasis began to be placed on the last word or finger in a counting series . this emphasis seems to be inherent to human thinking . for example , when a child who is learning to count is asked how many teddy bears he or she has , the child gives the whole sequence of numbers and then puts emphasis on the last word , as in , " i have one , two , three , four teddy bears ." since humans have 10 fingers , that number became a natural transition point during this stage , allowing people to count upward in sets of 10 . finally , wiese believes " a full - blown number concept " emerged in humans with the use of stable word - lists linked to amounts . counting words and numbers , he says , do not merely refer to numbers . they are the numbers . " the idea is that numbers are not some abstract platonic entities that must be grasped by us , but mental tools that we develop ourselves : tools we use to assess properties like cardinality ( four buses ), rank ( the fourth bus ), and identity ( the number four bus )," he says . counting words and mathematical concepts , therefore , are intertwined with our language skills , and even appear to be dependent upon them . though the reverse is not the case . some cultures , such as the hunter - gatherer piraha of the amazon , have language but do not even possess systems for numbers or counting . professor terrence deacon , a linguist at the university of california at berkeley , agrees with many of the conclusions of wiese ' s study . " wiese builds the case for numerical cognition growing out of the symbolic cognition at the base of language - not as a parasitic spin - off , or a mere naming of numerical concepts , but as an ability whose roots extend to the same underlying cognitive operations ," he says . several recent studies support the language - maths link . in a study published last month in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , professor yiyuan tang and colleagues found that chinese and english speakers not only have different ways of representing numbers with language , they also think about numbers with different parts of their brains . yet another study , conducted by miami - dade county public school researchers in florida , found that bilingual individuals do better at maths than their monolingual peers . ours being was own so most nor about t does him herself nor himself few or most been those then until my not these these theirs my be at her our against an by after those
