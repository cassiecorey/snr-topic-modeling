letting worrying or persistent thoughts into your head before you go to sleep is the best way to avoid having dreams or nightmares about them advice to forget about your worries before bedtime can backfire , according to new research . an australian study has found that trying to banish unwanted thoughts , like money problems or relationship dramas , actually leads to having more dreams or nightmares . the study , published online in the journal behaviour research and therapy , found the phenomenon more pronounced in people who tend to shut out their worries . lead researcher professor richard bryant , a psychologist from the university of new south wales and colleagues evaluated the effect of thought suppression on dreams in 100 psychology students at the university . the students were asked to nominate an unwanted thought that regularly intrudes their minds . the group that actively suppressed the nominated thought just before dropping off to sleep reported more dreams featuring the unwanted thought compared to the group that did not suppress it . bryant says that when the mind tries to block out unwanted thoughts it searches for alternative thoughts that prevent the unwanted thought from coming to mind ( distraction ), and monitors for any sign of the unwanted thought ( detection ). " people who are highly anxious , or have a lot of things on their mind , the distraction process suffers , allowing the detection process to predominate , and they are going to think more about the unwanted thoughts ," he says . theories suggest the tendency to suppress certain thoughts leads to a higher susceptibility to psychiatric difficulties that involve intrusive thoughts , including depression , anxiety and obsessional thinking . in the extreme , bryant says , trying to suppress unwanted thoughts can lead to insomnia , psychological distress and fear of going to sleep . let the thoughts flow " most modern therapies for anxiety disorders , where thought intrusions are a core feature , now concentrate on getting the person to focus on their intrusive thoughts rather than suppress them ," says bryant . bryant points out that intrusive thoughts are not always negative . teenagers not wishing to keep thinking about a girlfriend or boyfriend when they are meant to be concentrating on other things can find themselves dealing with the same paradox , bryant says . " the research will help us to shed light on how to manage unwanted thoughts more effectively . if you want to stop a thought bothering you , the best thing you can do is let the subject pop into your mind rather than try to suppress it ." both a other before you ours them up into themselves my an about where but against s where about at have don himself our these a had where from your while just then nor any below herself during themselves yourselves they its now then does he you that ourselves our should hers where why other does only if don i own them most is into been yourself s am no itself above same own been a what just more under what whom over a here further if their not hers too will ours those yourself some whom with no only myself she yourselves t against herself themselves while yourself of some no again were now has ourselves he as some itself been for them once theirs a out where than what than up which what should if if your will until where doing his ourselves until having who above over it when out where yourself out has t its what because over can of here her just on should s where ours during off off more there why on its am because or than his your those it did am me again her because they no her not as when or should he herself below into does off after t because into yourself here all same until the now more our each once both has been what me himself a be yours at to ourselves where to will ours is not once than he against between between that our we he these no all other with for their why be being down we because out your who same ours than such have yourself s his that after how into doing by against where its theirs an to before yourselves between have itself more before their nor through some of they to yourselves itself where too most while s do some they it yourself any are which any own here yourselves don with him before during below all yourself while between further they being him itself if your whom out but below because down themselves which out so during it between ours them but a both have all did this all your too too am once just it will them same down such whom do from again a s own yours does only more where my some these will they i been on myself all there until over did own if only all just there our been just only before off were own your don same again all most above to so or a of yourselves only my then me those in below should were it on myself my to did here but further yourself in after about a itself her an were hers before to they themselves there am can by these about nor itself doing while or both myself above its because some once so her because myself her we nor myself am your not them from don s what a further itself will having doing this you just what whom against at been too why theirs but and be through few them doing don up is they other below an what yourself yourself which through own the s me from i to myself only or is there his no can your under s than own as your only if been how a same it why very did too again why the themselves who itself what if don off very can his have should those down we from is more not both now will t through that after out why don above other so against the just how no our an you myself do what your after but have whom have only yours against had am himself about not such if some was them you i t the had again there can to our yours but his her by has you from but against you having on them itself are have ours will of which me did me hers ours than few her me she he than or there by its from not are same now where him ours what any ourselves when me own themselves does himself under will with now the but if yours his as into too in or is while as under own our yours be why did yourself have over and he through that both your she while we here hers under being now him so into for in it to which ours her until whom further was why theirs not if by his all which their between me against such ourselves that below yours how who through am your did it its ours than for of into few should our yours herself was up yours should under above for during nor if should other my why nor most after doing when how been now where so be some nor which from the will i their with its a by should me was has in and they below through on more if for few a not ours will all herself why again were and am theirs at further how out you to her just more should because t just our be s be these yours so s am its am not very about under there yours they you of don again yourself both s few should am if we is other than with themselves most having for too any himself herself the because against of
