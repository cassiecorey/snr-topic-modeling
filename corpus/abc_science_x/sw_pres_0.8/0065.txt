friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans , new research suggests female baboons that suffer the loss of a close friend or relative turn to other baboons for comfort and support , according to a new study . the study encompasses 14 years of observing over 80 free - ranging baboons in botswana ' s okavango delta . it provides the first direct evidence that certain animals mourn the loss of individuals , even when the rest of their social group remains intact . the findings also suggest that friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans . researchers were particularly struck by the behaviour of one female chacma baboon ( papio hamadryas ursinus ) named sylvia . she was described as " the queen of mean " and disdainful of other baboons until she lost her daughter , sierra , to a lion kill . " in the week after sierra died , sylvia was withdrawn ," says dr anne engh , who led the project . " when the other females were grooming and socialising , she tended to sit alone and rarely interacted even with her other relatives ." engh , a postdoctoral researcher in the department of biology at the university of pennsylvania , adds : " after a week or two of moping around , sylvia suddenly initiated grooming with several low - ranking females . i think that they were as surprised as i was ; they seemed awfully nervous at first . eventually , sylvia settled into close relationships with a very low - ranking female and with sierra ' s daughter , margaret ." relieving stress engh says that grooming is a friendly behaviour similar to two human friends chatting over a drink . the activity seems to relax the participants to the point where it can lower stress hormone levels . those levels rise in humans and baboons after a close friend or relative dies . the researchers measured a group of such hormones , called glucocorticoids , in sylvia and 20 other females . baboons that experienced losses had elevated levels of the hormones after the deaths . in humans , this is associated with bereavement , so it is likely that baboons also grieve their dead . the mourning animals then widened their social circles by approaching and grooming other females , even those that were beneath them in rank . this appeared to help them cope with losses , since stress hormone levels significantly dropped afterwards . the discovery , outlined in a recent proceedings of the national academy of sciences paper , underscores the importance of friendship . " humans and baboons who are more socially integrated have lower glucocorticoid levels ," says engh . " both the human research and our results highlight the importance of friendly social relationships in reducing stress . " female [ baboons ] usually have one or two close female friends that usually devote a large proportion of their grooming to each other , and they seem to enjoy spending time close together ." engh also mentions that friendships form between male and female baboons . for those relationships , the female often grooms the male , while the male protects the female , and any infants that she might have , from predation and bullying baboons . no surprise there brian craft , lead keeper at the oakland zooin california , says that he was not surprised by the findings . " advanced relationships are seen in chimpanzees , bonobos , as well as baboons and other multi - social troops ," craft explains . " friendships , which may help to ease stress after deaths , can be beneficial to the troop as a whole , as they keep it cohesive . it also appears that friend selection among baboons and other primates is somewhat of a choice , as for humans , and is not just instinctive behaviour ." whom this now about each the don where no themselves my does theirs very we been through ourselves nor
