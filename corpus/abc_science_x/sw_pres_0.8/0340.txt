a vacuum - based robot could climb tall buildings more efficiently than those with suction caps and claws , its designer says a wall - climbing robot could replace people in building inspections and one day survey urban war zones , where corners , rooftops and building materials thwart otherwise capable robots . the city climber rover , being developed by professor jizhong xiao and his team at the city college of new york , uses a vacuum chamber to get vertical . the robot is part of a project that aims to automate mandatory building inspections . " new york city mandates that the facades of buildings be inspected every five years ," says xiao . " but the current manual inspection is time - consuming and the cost is very high ." xiao thinks his robot can do the job faster , cheaper , and more thoroughly than trained technicians , who typically perform their gravity - defying work from suspended scaffolding . conventional robotic wall climbers typically employ more superhero - like methods : sticky feet , suction cups , claws , or magnets . but those grippers are only as good as the surface they make contact with . suction cups or sticky feet , for example , work best on smooth surfaces such as glass or marble , but not so well on brick . clawed toes clamber well over rock and brick but slip on glass . what ' s more , such devices tend to move tentatively and cannot navigate over a variety of textured surfaces . vacuum technology getting a robot to both cling to a wall and maneuver effortlessly over it are among the two biggest challenges that face researchers focused on wall - climbing robots , says professor ning xi , director of the laboratory of robotics and automation at michigan state university . " in both aspects , the city climber is probably the best in the world right now ," says xi , who is not associated with the project . the one kilogram device clings to the wall by way of a vacuum rotor located in the centre of its underbelly . the rotor ' s impeller draws air in from the centre of the device and spews it out toward the edges . the column of circulating air creates a region of low air pressure inside the vacuum chamber . because the surrounding air pressure is higher , it pushes down on the device , keeping it tight to the wall . small wheels on the underbelly of the device drive the robot forward and back . by linking two triangular - shaped modules with a hinged arm , the researchers were able to make the city climber manoeuver around 90 degree angle corners and transition from a wall to a roof , all with the strength to pull or carry a payload four times its weight . " they have achieved one of the highest payloads reported in the literature ," says professor nikos papanikolopoulos of the university of minnesota . xiao plans to equip his rover with a high - resolution digital camera . between their is ourselves this i were about herself they itself why below down more your about under from into when what it and few is had here of any down until out
