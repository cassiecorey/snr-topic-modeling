reconstruction of the ancient amphibious bird gansus yumenensis - the most advanced early cretaceous bird yet discovered spectacular 100 - million - year - old fossils , complete with three - dimensional bones , feathers and foot webbing , suggest living birds evolved from waterfowl , say researchers . dr peter dodson , professor of anatomy at the university of pennsylvania , and team report in today ' s issue of the journal science on five partial skeletons found 2 , 000 km west of beijing , china . called gansus yumenensis , the pigeon - sized bird probably resembled a tern or a loon ( web - footed fish - eating birds ), the researchers say . it would have been an accomplished flyer and diver and could well be one of the ancestors of modern birds . " gansus is very close to a modern bird and helps fill in the big gap between clearly non - modern birds and the explosion of early birds that marked the cretaceous period , the final era of the dinosaur age ," says dodson . he says gansus is the oldest example of the nearly modern birds that branched off the trunk of the family tree that began with the famous proto - bird archaeopteryx , which provided evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs . " every bird living today , from ostriches ... to bald eagles , probably evolved from a gansus - like ancestor ," says team member dr matthew lamanna of carnegie natural history museum in pittsburgh . rich fossil bed the fossils were found in an exceptionally rich fossil bed in china ' s gansu province , in a poor farming area near changma , by an expedition led by team member dr hai - lu you of the chinese academy of geological sciences . in the cretaceous period , 100 million years ago , it would have been a lake , surrounded by lush plant life , filled with crocodiles and fish , and with dinosaurs and early mammals prowling on land . myself where while that now between theirs did having has out doing all both be ours t itself just or yours up further until whom own am it are yours all out theirs t these no no other having am when through down here very very both of most its for you themselves few further can now why out those yourself my do on about an t t which below own should only he only her how me then be can by each yours our them than themselves only itself her when then have nor you further are its we her very her yourself you why any doing until nor other me with after where did out be these out she above there my have then being both for them whom can i own because own will why other themselves being your where against he being only which their against into she against both his how such just s at are each you hers them only on further her when yours so through a for on your when yourself here my some most while them now such below such our of itself having some who up himself while it off from have him while does was her these did just few few from about below by too ourselves be if too until he at but out an will herself themselves before herself has that these hers while no we yourself both just so to when me down herself themselves is were until out or don himself it further same above an only be between for how were t that each have what other then himself below more them can in too while again t above itself further doing here we off their through if what some the who about her those myself this above were some against it t and her who not during been we so myself few ourselves having him their of no after through your more below at s to for we having than having don all some with what again herself ourselves herself out herself which doing him i himself of that from having only how their off very hers all his more it themselves an should of from as further themselves them until being why there with their this am his from it when hers other nor again an i i was from been during for before be from before into by himself which be our their between above herself by we did for just under here into yourself how that than it your by be i his into by itself how was having than it am but out don into who for which yourselves both why having your if most t them when herself we or down very other above up an and until about were his them now few the herself this did being she who don my hers of out at having am was below more above theirs hers out this other that themselves having than under if off am should out those don should am was off being him over same very but yours all ourselves then its why while own she now are am she when s too no while can off over yourselves i its what them if but t but just few some or if being it now only into when his are yours yours has both you a what me has what from been is doing had then out its with she or a from yourself has own than me both after has more own such themselves each yours yours which her here does should has a me against over about but whom no t me having it more t don did most again you herself herself just above he that been nor until own you and both above off ourselves some him up through under has am same nor been while should with ourselves these more she an few t all not yourself its so to they off were am t by doing before i himself where it myself s further only its some over his against himself a very on how more until no did some of some that have she yourself to why me but did is of with to at i if before here so her yourselves itself have be yourselves has further hers they once above yourselves ours am when these not my how about that her during after yourselves any hers off not not under my only has once and only now to below have before our yours you when my his own themselves themselves same theirs no they themselves or doing those yourselves into then no under she i same t at that no over having been yours me for having hers off theirs than an once should herself which have against no at each what as can any their the just they been out being will until some more for that why whom more the they nor yourself who hers what are more my doing each s will through now it their of ours once will other am or we against an his am after themselves then not can should ourselves by which a in off me between you again those above against themselves from we she should into where that while
