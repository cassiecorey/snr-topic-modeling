scientists found this cyanobacteria in sandy and muddy marine sediments near broome , western australia the oceans are teeming with 10 to 100 more types of bacteria than previously believed , many of them unknown to science , according to a new study . using a new genetic mapping technique , us , dutch and spanish scientists say they found more than 20 , 000 different types of microbe in a single litre of water from deep sites in the pacific and atlantic oceans . " these observations blow away all previous estimates of bacterial diversity in the ocean ," says lead author dr mitchell sogin of the marine biological laboratory at woods hole , massachusetts . he says past studies have suggested that one litre of water would contain 1000 to 3000 types of microbe , the oldest form of life on the planet . microbes make up more than 90 % of the total mass of life in the seas , from bacteria to whales . " we ' ve found 10 or maybe 100 times more diversity in sea water than anyone imagined was present ," he says . the study is part of a global census of marine life and is published today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . sogin says the findings suggest there might be more than 10 million types of bacteria in the seas alone . " if you ' re interested in new frontiers , things to discover , all you have to do is go to the ocean ," sogin says . until recent years , estimates of the total number of species on earth were below a million . the new findings suggest that a swimmer swallowing a mouthful of sea water may be consuming perhaps 1000 types of bacteria . the report says that many of the types of bacteria found at the sample sites , including a hydrothermal vent at a subsea volcano off oregon , are present in very low numbers , in what the researchers call a " rare biosphere ". " not only are they diverse from each other but they are very diverse from anything we have in the molecular database ," sogin says . the variety could upset normal understanding of the make - up of life in the oceans , and how it evolved . one possibility is that some types of microbe are rare in some parts of the oceans but common in others , challenging traditional views of the seas as a homogenous bacterial soup . " there might be a ' biogeography ' of microorganisms in the sea , something that microbiologists have been debating for perhaps hundreds of years ," sogin says . another possibility is that rare bacteria are tolerated in a habitat because they produce something , perhaps an enzyme or vitamin , that more common species need . a side - effect of tolerating scarce types of bacteria is that they might prove to be a reserve of spare parts to help ocean life rebound after some cataclysm such as a giant asteroid or an ice age , sogin says . some rare species , for instance , might have genes allowing them to thrive if large tracts of the oceans freeze . bacteria can exchange genetic material relatively easily , speeding adaptation and recovery of the total ocean population . sogin says the variety of life might also benefit pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms . " if you have a business plan based on drugs from diverse microbes the study should be very encouraging ," he says . should your into a an most will am by t at you in which its himself she just now
