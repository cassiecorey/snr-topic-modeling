when black holes collide , they spiral towards each other then shed vast amounts of energy as space - ripping gravity waves powerful ripples that rend the fabric of space as black holes collide have been simulated for the first time by a supercomputer , finally giving astronomers something specific to watch for with new gravity wave telescopes . black holes , collapsed stars tens to billions of times more massive than the sun , are believed to merge fairly often in the cosmos , as they get trapped by each other ' s gravity . when it happens , they spiral towards each other and shed up to 40 % of their energy in the form of powerful , space - torturing gravity waves , according to the new simulation . these waves propagate through the universe and researchers say the waves ought to be detectable with the right equipment . " for years we didn ' t know what to expect ," says dr joan centrella , chief of the gravitational astrophysics laboratory at nasa ' s goddard space flight center in maryland . the researchers used the world ' s fourth - fastest computer , nasa ' s columbia supercomputer , to crunch the numbers in some of einstein ' s toughest equations regarding black holes . they ' ve come up with a basic gravity wave signature of a black hole merging process from start to finish . " now we have einstein ' s prediction ," she says . " this is a conceptualisation that we didn ' t have until now ." computer power the new gravity wave simulation is the culmination of three decades of research that , until recently , required more computer power than was available . the results are being published in the journals physical review letters and physical review d . " for a long time they ' d just crash and burn ," she says of earlier computerised attempts to run einstein ' s equations on the theory of general relativity . in the end , it took a fifth of columbia ' s parallel computer processors about 80 hours to crunch the complex 90 - year - old equations . added up processor - by - processor , the calculations took more than 18 years of processor time , centrella says . the researchers were pleased to discover one of their results . regardless of the different possible orbits and speeds two black holes have when they begin to merge , they end up producing the same signature wave patterns as they near the end of their collision , centrella says . that should make them pretty easy to identify . the next step will be to detect some actual gravity waves and see if they match the simulation . that will be , in effect , one tremendous test of einstein ' s work on black hole theory , says centrella . it will also mark the genuine birth of a whole new field of astronomy . " black holes play a key role in gravitational wave astronomy ," says astronomer professor peter saulson of syracuse university in new york . " they will be the primary source of gravity waves ." searching for gravity waves saulson works on the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) in hanford , washington , which started searching the skies for gravity waves late last year . ligo , with its 4 kilometre - wide antenna , ought to be able to detect gravity waves from the collisions of smaller black holes , says saulson . as for the far larger supermassive black holes found at the centres of galaxies , their gravity waves will require a space - borne observatory that can detect much lower frequency gravity waves , he says . that ' s the goal of nasa ' s laser interferometer space antenna , which will have three spacecraft 3 million miles apart and linked by lasers , due to be launched in 2015 . before
