this composite image shows a vast cloud of hot gas ( red ), surrounding high - energy bubbles 10 , 000 light years across ( blue ) on either side of the bright white area around the supermassive black hole black holes , the monstrous matter - sucking drains in space , are the most fuel - efficient engines in the universe , researchers say . just how efficient ? if a car could use this kind of engine , it could theoretically go about 1 . 6 billion kilometres on 4 . 5 litres of petrol , says dr steve allen , an assistant professor at stanford university . unfortunately , no earthly car could do this , as black holes are fuelled by matter lured by the holes ' vast gravity . their pull is so strong that nothing , not even light , can escape . most of the energy released by this matter as it gets close to the black hole ' s point of no return , or event horizon , shows up in the form of high - energy jets , which spew forth from magnetised discs of gas . these jets speed away from the black hole at speeds up to 95 % of the speed of light , which is 300 , 000 kilometres per second , and create huge bubbles in the hot cosmic gas of the galaxies . these bubbles can measure hundreds or even thousands of light - years across . a light - year is about 10 trillion kilometres , the distance light travels in a year . to come up with their fuel - efficiency estimate , allen and his colleagues used nasa ' s orbiting chandra x - ray observatory to peer into the inner regions of nine giant elliptical galaxies . this view gave the scientists an idea of how much matter , the black holes ' fuel , was available . other chandra observations were used to figure out how much power would be required for the jets to produce the big bubbles . the scientists calculated that the energy in the jets is equivalent to about trillion trillion trillion watts . the fuel reservoirs for these high - efficiency black hole engines are so big , the scientists say , they could keep things going for hundreds of billions of years . this is many times the current estimated age of the universe , which is 13 . 7 billion years . how about other galaxies ? this fuel - efficient phenomenon may be common to giant galaxies like the ones the researchers observed , which are about 10 times as massive as ours . but they are probably not common to the milky way , the scientists say . dr kim weaver of nasa ' s goddard space flight center says these supermassive black holes also appear to limit star formation and galactic sprawl . the heat coming from the black hole jets is believed to heat up the gas around the galactic centre . without this source of heat , the gas would cool down and form new stars , weaver says . " this is one way to keep the stars from forming and letting the galaxies grow bigger ," she says . this their where the was had my once me a and her during and these what or doing such because do
