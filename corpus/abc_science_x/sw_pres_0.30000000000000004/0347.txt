reconstruction of the ancient amphibious bird gansus yumenensis - the most advanced early cretaceous bird yet discovered spectacular 100 - million - year - old fossils , complete with three - dimensional bones , feathers and foot webbing , suggest living birds evolved from waterfowl , say researchers . dr peter dodson , professor of anatomy at the university of pennsylvania , and team report in today ' s issue of the journal science on five partial skeletons found 2 , 000 km west of beijing , china . called gansus yumenensis , the pigeon - sized bird probably resembled a tern or a loon ( web - footed fish - eating birds ), the researchers say . it would have been an accomplished flyer and diver and could well be one of the ancestors of modern birds . " gansus is very close to a modern bird and helps fill in the big gap between clearly non - modern birds and the explosion of early birds that marked the cretaceous period , the final era of the dinosaur age ," says dodson . he says gansus is the oldest example of the nearly modern birds that branched off the trunk of the family tree that began with the famous proto - bird archaeopteryx , which provided evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs . " every bird living today , from ostriches ... to bald eagles , probably evolved from a gansus - like ancestor ," says team member dr matthew lamanna of carnegie natural history museum in pittsburgh . rich fossil bed the fossils were found in an exceptionally rich fossil bed in china ' s gansu province , in a poor farming area near changma , by an expedition led by team member dr hai - lu you of the chinese academy of geological sciences . in the cretaceous period , 100 million years ago , it would have been a lake , surrounded by lush plant life , filled with crocodiles and fish , and with dinosaurs and early mammals prowling on land . our above why very their be below
