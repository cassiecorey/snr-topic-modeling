" prior to our discoveries , only a few isolated examples of dinosaur fossils had been found in the northern part of new zealand ," he says . " now we ' ve found dinosaur remains almost 1000 kilometres east out in the middle of the south pacific ." he adds that his team has already uncovered more dinosaur fossils in the chathams than had been unearthed in new zealand over the past 25 years . while some dinosaur remains had been found along the antarctic peninsula and in south america , this is the first such discovery in the southwest pacific and is possibly unique in the southern hemisphere , he says . "[ the dinosaurs ] were on their own evolutionary path for probably 15 million years since the separation of the chathams - new zealand region some 85 - 80 million years ago ," he says . stilwell found the first fossils by accident when he visited the chatham islands in 2003 . " no one had even hypothesised that there were any fossils out that far ," he says . with a grant from the national geographic society , stilwell and associates returned to the archipelago to continue their research , the first findings of which were published in the journal palaeogeography , palaeoclimatology , palaeoecology . but he says a subsequent trip to the islands in february yielded a " huge collection " of new fossils , which are still being analysed . " the story ' s going to get better ," he says . if in the have yours ours i there be between not they here an
