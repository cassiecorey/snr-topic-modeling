the pinwheel galaxy contains one trillion stars the largest and most detailed image of a spiral galaxy has been released , including surprising views of its star - forming regions . the image is of the gigantic pinwheel galaxy , or messier 101 , and was compiled from 51 images from the hubble space telescope , with extra data from ground - based telescopes . the image reveals a giant spiral disc of stars , dust and gas , some 170 , 000 light - years across , about twice the diameter of the milky way . a high - resolution version of the image , which shows individual stars , is available on the space telescope science institute website . the galaxy contains about one trillion stars , about 100 billion thought to be about the same age and temperature as our sun . its spiral arms have large star - forming nubulae , star nurseries in hydrogen clouds . and bright young clusters of newborn blue stars trace out the spiral arms . the disc of the galaxy is so thin , the researchers say , that hubble easily sees many more distant galaxies through it . the pinwheel galaxy lies in the northern constellation the great bear and is about 25 million light - years from earth . the light we see from the galaxy today is as it was at the beginning of the miocene period on earth , when mammals flourished and the mastodon first appeared , the researchers say . the composite image was compiled from images originally taken to study the expansion rate of the universe , star cluster formation , x - ray emissions and blue supergiant stars . how did theirs too am why being her most what herself it herself than here under the itself itself out up have don between out what
