methane bubbles trapped in lake ice in october fears that retreating permafrost is accelerating climate change have been strengthened by a new study that says emissions of the greenhouse gas methane are soaring in northern siberia . in a complex cycle , permafrost melts at the edges of lakes that previously were iced over year - round , according to the research led by dr katey walter of the university of alaska at fairbanks . organic material , the remains of rotted plants and long - dead animals , then subsides into the lake from the soil , slides to the lake bottom and decomposes to form methane . eventually , during a thaw , this methane bubbles to the surface and is released into the atmosphere . in the first major study into the bubbling phenomenon , or ebullition , walter ' s team believes that current estimates of methane released from wetlands between latitudes 65 and 70 & deg ; north should be upgraded by 10 - 63 %. " ebullition from siberian thaw lakes is a large and increasing source of atmospheric [ methane ] as siberian thaw lakes continue to expand ," warns the study , published today in the journal nature . between 1974 and 2000 , a period that matches figures for local warming , the spread of thaw lakes caused methane emissions in siberia to rise by 58 %, it says . the greenhouse gas methane comes from natural sources such as agriculture , decomposing vegetation and marshland . one worry is what scientists called a " positive feedback " from billions of tonnes of stored methane that is locked in the ground and under frozen lakes in canada and siberia . this scenario , in essence , is a vicious circle , scientists say : global warming warms up the permafrost , which releases the trapped methane and this in turn adds to the greenhouse effect . volume for volume , methane is 21 times more effective at trapping solar heat respectively than carbon dioxide . by itself , methane accounts for a fifth of the man - made greenhouse effect of the past 200 years , scientists say . once how myself all hers all by we above its out you are it for its up while there if further yourselves those nor off she he herself been an
