jupiter ' s great red spot , with its smaller cousin red spot junior , seen through a special filter that samples thermal radiation from deep in the cloud layer astronomers have taken images of jupiter ' s lesser known red spot , a smaller landmark called red spot junior . the smaller spot is about as wide as earth and formed from the merger of three white spots sometime between 1998 and 2000 . red spot junior only turned red in december 2005 , astronomers say . using the keck ii telescope on hawaii ' s mauna kea , scientists from the university of california , berkeley , and the wm keck observatory captured a high - resolution picture of both small and large red spots late in july . both are located in the same area and appear to be racing each other around the planet . the larger great red spot rotates westwards , in the opposite direction to the planet , the scientists say . as alternating bands on the surface of jupiter move in opposite directions , the nearby smaller spot moves eastwards . the two spots are about the same colour when seen in visible light , but red spot junior is much darker when viewed at infrared wavelengths , the scientists say . that difference could mean the smaller storm ' s cloud tops are lower than the big storm ' s . astronomers have known about jupiter ' s great red spot , a high - pressure storm on the big planet ' s surface , for centuries . this better known spot is nearly twice its smaller companion ' s size and has been circling jupiter for at least 342 years . don over any themselves from being own he an about have there has than should below if i through but about can here being of now up don most the
