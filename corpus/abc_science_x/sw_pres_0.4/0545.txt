pluto , or 134340 , is in the centre and its satellite charon , 134340 1 , is just below it . the newly discovered satellites , now called 134340 ii and 134340 iii , are to the right pluto has been stripped of its membership of the cosmic a - list and given a humble new tag : 134340 . the enigmatic , icy world spotted in 1930 is know officially known as 134340 pluto . it has been lumped among 136 , 562 asteroids and other small bodies by the minor planet center , part of the international astronomical union ( iau ). pluto ' s satellites , charon , nix and hydra , have been numbered 134340 i , 134340 ii and 134340 iii respectively under the latest minor planet list . the iau last month declared pluto to be a ' dwarf planet ' that should not belong among the hallowed ranks of mercury , earth , venus , mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune . the organisation is now drawing up a catalogue of dwarf planets whose initial members will include pluto , the large asteroid ceres and a distant object , 2003 ub313 , unofficially named xena . until the iau meeting , 2003 ub313 had laid claim to being the solar system ' s 10th planet . rebel astronomers are circulating a petition , contesting the dwarf planet definition as unscientific and the decision on pluto as undemocratic . they intend to hold a conference next year that , in their view , will overhaul the definition of a planet . pluto ' s status had long been contested by astronomers who say its tiny size , odd orbit and orbital plane preclude it from joining the other acknowledged planets . by the new iau yardstick , a planet has " cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit ". in other words , it is massive enough to wield a gravity that clears rocks and other debris on its orbital path . of very against can same as down am are all very are having where when he do itself again now in with after yourselves why from than against but
