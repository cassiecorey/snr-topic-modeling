embryonic stem cells could be grown into islet cells to treat diabetes , say researchers australian stem cell researchers will start negotiating with ivf clinics to access human eggs following this week ' s landmark decision to overturn a ban on creating cloned embryos specifically for scientific research . despite objections from prime minister john howard and the new leader of the opposition , kevin rudd , the lower house of the australian parliament last night voted to allow the process . this paves the way for laws to implement the recommendations of the lockhart review into stem cell research . " i think it ' s fantastic news . it ' s raised the morale of the scientists ," says professor alan trounson , international director of the australian stem cell centre . " we ' re thrilled ." his team wants to use somatic cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) to investigate options for disease diagnosis and treatment once the new laws are enacted . scnt involves the creation of an embryo by inserting a nucleus from a patient ' s body cell into an egg cell that has had its nucleus removed . under the new laws such an embryo would be permitted to grow for 14 days and provide scientists with stem cells for use in research . but the first step for researchers like trounson is to get hold of a ready supply of human eggs and he ' s not sure whether there will be enough . " we ' re looking forward to seeing whether we can obtain eggs for these studies . that will be the critical component i think ," he says . " we ' ll be talking to our colleagues in the infertility clinics because they will be the connection to obtaining human eggs for making embryonic stem cells ." eggs a limiting factor neuroscientist professor peter schofield of the lockhart review agrees that finding eggs will be a key issue . " in practice we will probably find that eggs may be a limiting factor ," he says . myself who very a his were how by itself before over not does an below by but those their just
