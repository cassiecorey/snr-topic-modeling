debris disc around beta pictoris showing light reflected by dust around the young star astronomers have discovered a solar system that seems like an early version of our own , the us space agency says . it has huge quantities of carbon gas mixed with a cloud of dust surrounding a young , yellow star called beta pictoris . the star and its emerging solar system , in which planets could already be forming , is less than 20 million years old , say the researchers . the abundance of carbon gas in the dust disc surrounding the star means that the planets being formed could be rich in graphite and methane much like those of our solar system in the early stages , they say . the astronomers , led by dr aki roberge , of nasa ' s goddard flight center , is published in the journal nature . " there is much , much more carbon gas than anyone expected ," roberge says . " could this be what our own solar system looked like when it was young ? are we seeing the formation of new types of worlds ? either prospect is fascinating ." the astronomers made their observations using the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer satellite launched in 1999 . beta pictoris first discovered in 1984 , beta pictoris is located in our galaxy , is 60 light - years from earth and has been measured at 1 . 8 times the sun ' s mass . images of beta pictoris taken by the orbiting hubble space telescope show it could have a jupiter - type planet already and possibly also rocky planets in the course of formation , astronomers say . himself them been few being to against the no its who just into this as has a he were before below off into about you below very themselves down other are each other up
