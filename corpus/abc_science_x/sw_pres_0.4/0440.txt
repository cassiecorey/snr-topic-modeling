adult ( top ) and juvenile ( bottom ) umoonasaurus , one of two new species of ancient marine reptile scientists have identified two new species of ancient marine reptile that swam in an australian outback sea 115 million years ago . the reptiles , named umoonasaurus and opallionectes , belonged to the plesiosaurs group which included a predator like a killer whale from the jurassic period , says palaeontologist dr benjamin kear from the university of adelaide . kear , whose team studied 30 opalised fossils mainly from around the outback mining town of coober pedy in south australia , publish their research in the latest issue of the journal palaeontology and online in the journal biology letters . kear says the long - necked marine reptiles swam in the shallow water of an inland sea that once existed in central australia . freezing polar water covered large parts of australia 115 million years ago when the island continent was much closer to antarctica . the umoonasaurus was about 2 . 4 metres long and had three crest - like ridges on its skull . " imagine a compact body with four flippers , a reasonably long neck , small head and short tail , much like a reptilian seal ," kear says . the team named the reptile after the aboriginal name for coober pedy , umoona . the opallionectes was 6 metres long , with masses of needle teeth used to trap small fish and squid . its name means ' the opal swimmer from andamooka ', the scientists say . kear says most of the fossils found were of juvenile creatures , leading the scientists to believe they had discovered a seasonal breeding ground for the ancient reptiles . herself other been those are until too s further just or to below do does yours her its here but same down between while ourselves so in having each because don down or himself him same further was their doing did me as his hers who ourselves these too has at down my each such
