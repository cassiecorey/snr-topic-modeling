this kentia or thatch palm grows near its sister species , the curly palm . so how did the two species arise when there are no geographical barriers between them ? one of the world ' s best examples of sympatric speciation , when two species from a single ancestor form in the absence of a geographical barrier , has been found among the swaying palm trees on australia ' s lord howe island . researchers have found two sister species of palms living side by side on the tiny world heritage listed island 580 kilometres off australia ' s east coast . the two species , the kentia or thatch palm ( howea forsteriana ) and curly palm ( h . belmoreana ), appear to have diverged after they began flowering at different times of year , probably as a result of differing soil preferences . the international team of researchers , including those from the uk ' s royal botanic gardens , kew , reports its findings online today in the journal nature . it ' s generally accepted that evolution occurs by one species breaking into two by the process of allopatric speciation . this might occur when , say , a mountain range separates a species and the two populations change gradually until they become so different they can no longer interbreed . but there are also theoretical reasons to believe that a species can split into two within its own area , a phenomenon known as sympatric speciation . the researchers used a range of techniques to show that the palm species are sisters and indeed diverged much more recently than the island ' s creation by volcanic activity 6 . 4 - 6 . 9 million years ago . they calculate that the palms ' common ancestor probably arrived from mainland australia as long as 4 . 5 - 5 . 5 million years ago . and more recently , h . forsteriana diverged from its related species , an ancestor of h . belmoreana . soil is the key they note that the flowering times of the palm trees differed on different soils , indicating the ancestors of the two species may have adapted to different soil types . they add that perhaps living on those different soil types modified the palm trees ' flowering times , reducing their chance of interbreeding . " that ' s probably what kick - started the speciation process and resulted in them finally being two separate species ," says associate professor david rowell , from the australian national university , canberra . " this paper is very clever because it uses lord howe island , which is very small , and where it is very unlikely that a species would be split into two , and so therefore it seems to be very strong evidence that sympatric speciation has occurred in this case . " that being the case , it lends strength to the models , hypotheses and theories that people have put up about how evolution works ." fishy clues to new species meanwhile , german researchers have discovered another case of apparent sympatric speciation , this time in two species of fish in lake apoyo crater , in nicaragua . a report in today ' s nature says the lake is just 5 kilometres across and less than 23 , 000 years old . but dna profiling shows that , during that time , it was colonised by the species amphilophus citrinellus , which gave rise to a . zaliosus . up over here yourself more such few we than by about as himself they can will themselves that she does will which yourself under by before as them those hers me so because his just them his in do himself more did i herself all
