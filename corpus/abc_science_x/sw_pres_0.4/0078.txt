poultry farmers burn chicken carcasses in nigeria , a country that has just started investigating suspected human cases of the h5n1 bird flu virus . now scientists are preparing for a worst - case scenario : a human bird flu pandemic a human vaccine against the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu virus has successfully passed the first stages in testing its safety and effectiveness , reports the manufacturer . the trial , carried out at the murdoch childrens research institute with the university of melbourne and the royal adelaide hospital , recently tested a vaccine made by csl ltd of melbourne . csl today announced that the vaccine triggered an immune response it predicts will equate with " a good level of protection " in " about half " of the 400 healthy adult volunteers tested . and , says dr andrew cuthbertson , csl ' s chief scientific officer , the participants got little more than the odd sore arm . " it was very reassuring in a safety sense ." the vaccine was based on a deactivated virus originally taken from a vietnamese patient . it was then grown up in fertilised chicken eggs , killed and mixed with an aluminium phosphate adjuvant before being given to volunteers . cuthbertson says the trial found immune stimulation occurred at two antigen doses of 7 . 5 microgram and two of 15 micrograms , although greater stimulation occurred at the double 15 microgram dose , which is the dose used in normal flu shots . while it is generally assumed the higher the immune stimulation , the greater the protection , cuthbertson says no one knows yet precisely what immune level will protect . further safety and efficacy studies csl says it now plans to organise a second trial to study the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in 800 other healthy volunteers , in particular children and older people who respond differently to vaccines . it also plans to test the impact of higher doses of vaccine to clarify the dose that gives the best immune response . he hopes the vaccine could be registered some time in the first half of 2007 . but , says cuthbertson , if the vaccine is eventually registered , it will be a matter for governments and regulatory agencies to decide the lowest dose that can protect the most number of people . how ready are we ? csl says if a bird flu pandemic arrived now , and it was directed by the government to do so , they would be able to produce the vaccine as it is in six weeks . but , if the pandemic strain mutated from the h5n1 to a strain more readily transmitted to humans , he says the time frame could be stretched . " if [ the virus ] was not too different we would proceed to crank out as much vaccine as possible of the one that we made already ," says cuthbertson . if it was very different csl would have to switch to making a new vaccine and this would take another six weeks . cuthbertson says registering a vaccine against the h5n1 strain will still save time even if the eventual pandemic strain is different because the therapeutic goods administration has told csl it would not have to repeat clinical trials . " it ' s making the assumption that the safety profile and so forth will be similar ," he says . other trials ? while there have been many attempts to make a vaccine around the world , there have been few results of clinical trials announced , says professor aileen plant , chief executive officer of the australian biosecurity cooperative research centre at curtin university and a consultant to the world health organization . " it is exciting , really ... i don ' t think there ' s been anywhere else that ' s been able to get that sort of immunological response with two doses of 15 micrograms ," says plant , who also sits on the federal government ' s national influenza pandemic action committee . she says a us trial last year that did not use an adjuvant had to give substantially more antigen to get an immune response , which means fewer people could be vaccinated . plant agrees that the vaccine could be used in an emergency , despite the missing data on children and elderly people . " if the pandemic came tomorrow , the risks would be so high that we would say that it was worth going with it even if we didn ' t have the data ." who only nor of while those that in don further just is now
