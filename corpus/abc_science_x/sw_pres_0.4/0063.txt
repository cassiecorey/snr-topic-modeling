disabling a memory molecule in the brain lifts depression in mice as effectively as using antidepressants , researchers say new fossils found in australia tell us that enormous snakes evolved from predatory lizards like goannas , scientists say . palaeontologist dr john scanlon describes the well - preserved 25 to 20 million - year old snake skulls from the riversleigh world heritage site , in today ' s issue of the journal nature . " there ' s been quite a bit of controversy about what sort of lizards snakes evolved from ," says scanlon , of the riversleigh fossils centre in mount isa . he says one idea is that snakes evolved from small burrowing insect - eating lizards that lost their legs and developed an elongated body . another idea is that snakes evolved from relatively large predatory lizards such as goannas . scanlon says he hopes the skulls , from a now extinct snake known as yurlunggur , will settle the debate on the evolution of snakes . the structure of the jaws and face prove that yurlunggur , an arnhem land aboriginal term for ' rainbow serpent ', is a very primitive snake , says scanlon . " it has so many features in common with lizards rather than other modern snakes ." for example , yurlunggur has a clear jugal bone , similar to a cheekbone , not present in modern snakes . and , in particular , the skulls show the snake is more closely related to large predatory lizards than to smaller insectivorous ones , says scanlon . " it basically shows a relationship between the most primitive snakes and the varanoid lizards such as goannas and mosasaurs ," he says , referring to the giant acquatic goannas that lived during the cretaceous period . here off it did that each some your to between whom both yours having most while this other she your yours yourself i don both themselves yourself do an in we
