" we are combining an air pollution sensor with a homemade [ mobilephone ]," da costa told new scientist . the team is planning to squeeze all the components onto a single board small enough for the birds to carry in a backpack , the report says . the pigeons will take to the air at the inter - society for electronic arts annual symposium in san jose in august . the data they send back will be displayed on the blog in the form of an interactive map . other whom between t she the here each against them with own once there by yours
