could the hobbit really be one of us after all ? scientists who argue the hobbit is really just a modern human with a small brain have published evidence for the first time in a major scientific journal . today ' s issue of the journal science carries a paper led by primate evolution expert , dr bob martin of the field museum in chicago , which says homo floresiensis is likely to have been a modern human who suffered from microcephaly , a condition that causes a small brain . this reignites the debate about whether the remains of the small hominid from the indonesian island of flores is really h . sapiens or a dwarf version of h . erectus that evolved after becoming isolated on the island , as was originally suggested . martin ' s team says that based on standard models of dwarfing , the hobbit ' s brain size is way too small to be that of a dwarf . it also argues the tools found alongside the hobbit are far too advanced to have been made by anyone but h . sapiens . " if you look at the history of stone tools around the world homo erectus never made tools like that ," says martin . " i ' ve been in this business for 30 years and i really smell a rat in this ," he says . " i don ' t think the standard story can be right and people are eventually going to see this ." his team also rejects findings of a study published last year that found the brain of h . floresiensis was unlike that of a microcephalic human . martin says the study , led by brain evolution expert professor dean falk of florida state university , compared the hobbit with only one microcephalic , which he now says is a child , when the researchers should have been comparing it with a microcephalic adult . martin ' s team describes the brains of two adult microcephalic specimens , a male from india and a female from lesotho , it says are similar to the hobbit ' s .
