no single event , like a huge meteor strike , is solely responsible for a mass extinction , says new research . not even the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago if you can ' t decide if you prefer meteor impacts , volcanoes or some other explanation for earth ' s biggest mass extinction events , take heart : you no longer have to choose . a new statistical study of mass extinctions throughout the history of life on earth is backing the idea that no single meteor , volcanic eruption or other lone gunman is ever to blame . this even applies to the cretaceous - tertiary event that brought the end of dinosaurs 65 million years ago , the us researchers say . instead , the worst die - offs happen when some sort of interminable , multi - generational pressure on life is combined with a few powerful blows . it ' s what is now being called the press - pulse theory of mass extinctions . reading the cretaceous - tertiary extinction literature and conversations with colleagues " made me wonder whether the simplistic scenario of ' everything ' s fine until one day in june when the asteroid hits and everything goes to hell - in - a - hand - basket ' really explains the diversity of data ," says plant fossil expert associate professor nan arens of hobart and william smith colleges in new york . wouldn ' t it make more sense , she surmised , if certain species were already vulnerable when the triggering event happened ? to test the idea , she and then - undergraduate student ian west compiled a large database of marine organisms and their extinctions through geological time . they divvied up the past 488 million years into four groups : suspected meteor impacts ( pulses ), gigantic volcanic flood basalt eruptions ( presses ), periods with neither presses nor pulses , and times when press and pulse coincided . they then compared average extinction rates in each group . flood basalt eruptions are considered presses because they release vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and can change the earth ' s climate . single or multiple event ? the researchers found similar extinction rates when a pulse or press occurred by itself , and when neither was occurring , says arens . " however , when an impact occurred during a time of volcanic flood , that produced higher extinction rates ." arens is presenting her work this week at the annual meeting of the geological society of america in philadelphia . " the goal of our work was to come up with a unifying theory of mass extinctions ," says west . they also wanted to make the theory applicable to the rapid extinctions now being seen as a result of accelerating climate change ( press ) and the ongoing destruction of wild habitats by human activities worldwide ( pulse ). "[ the theory ] is essentially a more eloquent way of saying what i and many other palaeontologists have been saying for many years ," says professor gerta keller of princeton university . " namely that the impact - kill hypothesis is all wrong . impacts alone could not have been the killing mechanism for the k - t [ cretaceous - tertiary event ] or any of the other major mass extinctions ." volcanic activity in the late cretaceous case massive volcanism , the deccan traps eruption in india , and attendant climate change , coincided with an impact that pushed highly stressed biota over the brink . " i ' m very happy they have done the analysis based on the literature and come up with the same conclusions that palaeontologists have been preaching all along ," keller says . your or we am these just their through than own be up so some her no nor same down very or under in such own in the while were below were here off not were here t from when has because are on me was very nor why herself your him how be they no having don had the nor all will few itself yourselves whom herself above under too me both her his then who under yourself before up into hers it while does s doing other on most t don at he over too will very who him i both me when above by them his his which not than their we into to does such me between above nor we themselves having yours of so of with yourselves when having all which so up ourselves her while this those very if me yourself s after what some to does up had doing too don of had now does having very i me i once himself from just between through our her its them as did up are than if don been my now whom same being but from by above now being her each above only some where then up did was doing as by you yours own by to more by out should when most more at herself yours your had our them theirs over yourself which if he over he will what can own should his its at when from over once can while why yours the were having ours we down at if as under at your our only been so in had don or down too him from very here herself but each what what with him how about himself be is same for am nor s during the yours same s an yourself me for when here to then more ours only should then through it because am theirs was we its because with we those just own some if all were each ours which don most through few all by off from by against why what myself up its from then our theirs hers was my they over our not there has once me themselves him it your our on but that yourself having and did theirs now because him been am until when down him nor theirs where they same too while its with having too him nor such there they few to only her the here herself yourself each can will at the a about both through from will she am into myself do off then there out if to those being once for now very down do such can before we who t further above their her your between more very been under are of under over than that themselves through yours can into until who most about you against any that only a own same is theirs up all only here will why below yours very above been nor how to are an after as should he up in do to for an as been if this again into during so myself most ours why s ourselves own were does with more above such himself some hers have has its we is into further my up or here out her have the what ourselves should by here being themselves while other who the hers being such own do between should her all this what which yours on through he they until has theirs into once over you those been in while too during for whom itself is why what having any until which these so all once to himself where any myself she what himself than i below to you ourselves these and yourselves more who through being he on your above was some to during its if don at they ourselves why through can when where will here does each ourselves after did if while both yours my had out they i most who no those very this doing are a nor they t an a herself or some has what other through into when how into here you other just its yours no more hers being above why her when again too by just did its how being on me she all own on below only of will i those more some once over a same its both having such his out ours the those their were more with each yours while which each few i once now during to not can an after am has don
