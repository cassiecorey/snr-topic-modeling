ahh , i remember this ... songs we hear as teenagers tend to remain lifelong favourites because they become hardwired into our memory during a critical time , a memory conference has heard . that critical time is known as the reminiscence bump , says steve janssen , a phd student at the university of amsterdam . janssen presented his research into how we form memories of our favourite music , books and movies at the 4th international conference on memory in sydney this week . he says the reminiscence bump can be partly explained by what ' s called differential encoding , or an ability to store events better during early adulthood . " you recall more memories from the period of 10 to 25 [ than previous or subsequent periods ] and the bump has a peak between 16 and 20 ," he says . " the brain works at its optimum in that period . it ' s a sponge and it soaks up everything ." we also learn languages and musical instruments best during this time . but attachment to songs isn ' t all about the reminiscence bump , he says . we also form a particularly personal connection with music from our teen years because we tend to listen to the same songs over and over , his research indicates . what ' s your favourite ? janssen found that when asked to rate their three favourite records , movies and books , participants in his study overwhelmingly chose items they listened to , watched or read between the ages of 16 and 21 . while music preferences were strongly linked to the reminiscence bump , favourite books and movies were more likely to have been read or viewed recently . this is because we usually only read books once or twice , and see movies a handful of times , but can be exposed to the same song many times , he reasons . " all distributions showed a reminiscence bump so there ' s evidence that people store events better in their teens ," janssen says . " however , i also found a larger recency effect for books and a larger reminiscence bump for records ... so i suggest a kind of interaction between those two mechanisms . " the results suggest that differential encoding initially causes the reminiscence bump , but resampling strengthens the bump ." janssen ' s presention was based on data gathered through an online survey between january 2005 and april this year . he analysed results from 1500 participants around the world with an average age of 36 , including 23 australians . you can participate in the study here . does had an that can why but off i t who yours now itself doing herself from t both nor an those have so before does hers do each our theirs few an by each them over each can were is against am because very for some by own yourselves as am by that not can now be my of because through are up my does most up which ourselves for above from but only have she for before own his same can as him has she did they some but be i down will him than off own did on same were who ours no until these himself the why those by be out am very before over this being so their any after what there itself here was only their each too during should down the is our about above just are does is did i have our most own as which all nor before out yourself my own to she myself that any more now her further should such don our in an me myself why so am own themselves here same what which being here for which me other yours himself that until of ourselves here in not yours while myself or of because on few be have only up your these am very ours both under now how ourselves the myself our himself a under s if for own same myself because s have be will on those their on again from myself do were was those few during until is such once i not again ourselves off by until was such some no themselves about you very below is there were off theirs most where each there before nor out against each while it that ourselves hers under is about his below while from more had she some which has about are so yourselves off again how himself no here me more both than so we his i just i herself too was there a but or them they these so why below this had she under ourselves is as such until few why some as does doing more same at own until off through up themselves those has am both been each to their further no having their out him or during up yourself his further their me myself once below here was how by such all me of further very being and having t nor down before he you against but how now himself at about when once which having at each then no under such yours further further against after how few too your no on again did having under some no so being he herself
