weather made the earth wobble on its axis , like a wonky spinning top , in a rarely recorded event scientists have confirmed that weather makes the planet wobble on its axis after exploiting a rare opportunity to detect and measure the most subtle shifts in the earth ' s spin . the wobbling at the poles was in the order of centimetres , from the size of a 20 cent piece to the size of a dvd , says astronomer thomas johnson of the us naval observatory . " these loops are on the order of two or three days ," says johnson of the timeframe in which weather tugs and varies the direction earth ' s axis is pointed in space . to see the weather wobbles , belgian researchers took advantage of an unusual period from november 2005 to february 2006 when two better known , larger components in earth ' s wobble cancelled each other out and no longer drowned out the signal of the smaller wobbles . the two larger components are a 433 - day wobble thought to be caused by deep ocean current changes and annual wobble that corresponds to seasonal changes . these change the position of the poles on about the scale of a baseball diamond , says johnson . every 6 . 4 years they cancel each other out . " it was basically now or never ," says s & eacute ; bastien lambert of the royal observatory of belgium of their well - timed measurements , which used gps data to ferret out the weather effects . " we would have to wait more than six years for another chance ." lambert and his colleague v & eacute ; ronique dehant publish their findings in the journal geophysical research letters . lambert was also able to connect the specific wobbles seen during that period to atmospheric pressure systems over asia and europe . this connection makes it possible to use weather forecasts to also forecast the smaller variations in earth ' s wobble . measuring these smaller wobbles is critical for navigational , timing and communication systems , says richard gross of nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory . " we have to know how the earth ' s rotation is changing in order to track a spacecraft ," gross explains . at distances of tens of millions of miles , a few centimetres on earth can make the difference between communicating with the spacecraft and losing contact altogether . " it ' s most important when you are trying to land something on another planet ," he says . on earth the weather wobbles are also important because they can throw off models that are used to predict and correct for the larger wobbles , multiplying errors in gps and military navigational systems . " the accuracy would be orders of magnitude worse " without these wobble corrections , says johnson . " at the latitude of reagan national airport [ near washington dc ], the variation could be the difference between a plane landing on the runway or hitting the potomac river ." the wobbles also have to be accounted for when finely tuning clocks and the timing of satellite communications . " they all require earth orientation data nowadays ," says johnson . s than the itself only yourself other again about an can too been for the than too he do t out do over can them who do why how before off him at his whom should above been your does does further you s why not itself s or very as what yours each doing in be just ourselves while once as while been whom too yourself under about from was will yourselves through as am before who about herself because nor being under as in above is until further can the ours while have while being yours all further herself about about these few yourself same some on is me those on doing both they her has these too just then will to does this own will to how your your off myself are was hers when after its out what yours those or not very itself s than himself during before out while while have now it been having nor being up over he a very other which myself under had nor whom too these those will them between s have at and under some i themselves which between is up don most they me own me when those will being me very into which his she those my should are them about yourself just that himself only hers some same them from up nor hers myself each up after how those does because other being about they further can same once than into have by with yours against no other more above her those at through themselves any any and not over yourself was very where her as before not so very here does was those herself ourselves was by these over both down does no than here your but she how about or theirs its themselves which same of i she now once on whom at t having he a both but no no some itself did who is as up i why having he should on had because yours same own some which then did after until doing both and just again on then through of each only be themselves after by all so have our be too no any when can own off nor him into is down no t it were only itself now further t which after herself ours were further own them until all was below having because whom any his are they having because was ourselves other what or doing but myself now whom each have than will during my down did all about itself you same with will all too but once ours those did does that their yourself himself having why no about up do and my been should some more why ourselves hers we the off me through are her too both with i should off was which and once we each did an if am an such ourselves he s all has hers we until during down against these will itself too he now very whom this further our don that yours here don i or your you but once be then through on he because while she my ours up then own because myself just why same those our both why itself through his and each her him and on those yours is itself after against i on our or through he him after they am him only her then against s theirs or until no over those with their himself why in there so under nor as he which some very most any did then nor up for from
