why did the turtle cross the road ? because it wanted lunch scientists are studying the wandering ways of australia ' s eastern long - necked turtle to see if can learn to cross the road . professor arthur georges , director of the applied ecology research group at the university of canberra , says it ' s the first time researchers have documented how roads affect the turtles . georges says unlike other turtles , chelodina longicollis has evolved the ability to take long overland hikes because it prefers ephemeral waters , such as temporary swamps and pools . " when a wetland dries , the nutrients are released from the sediment and when it refills there ' s a flush of production , so they ' re capitalising on all the insects and other foods that benefit from that flush ," he says . the hardy creatures gravitate to permanent waters in a drought , where they can ' switch off ' growth and reproduction , sometimes for as long as seven years . they then hit the road as soon as the rains come . georges and his team are studying a population of turtles in jervis bay in southern new south wales and hope to have some results ready for publication in the middle of the year . look right , look left , look right again georges says the long - necked turtle is familiar with its environment and may even have learnt to avoid roads . " what we have found is that they ... use the sun and an internal clock to navigate and they know landscape really well so they tend to beeline to various places ," he says . " we ' re going to take them from the wetlands and release them near a road and observe their behaviour as they approach the road . they may have an aversion to [ it ] and turn around ." but if the road safety message hasn ' t sunk in it may be necessary to build tunnels under roads to provide them with safe passage , he says . while it appears that some aspects of development have got in the way of the turtle ' s natural behaviour , it hasn ' t been all bad for the long - necked turtle , georges says . " when you fly over [ surrounding farmland ] you ' ll see there are lots of dams ," he says . " each one is full of about 20 - 30 turtles , and those sorts of water bodies weren ' t there before ," he says . " but on the downside , when a road runs through a wetland you can increase the chance that over time the population will decline ." theirs here an while am will of has during not out with while out as where more all will are very it few to where myself we a after than i here whom so that nor from between during the most than were me why because you whom in both just to or where if no having few this who down most been s from am these too some those itself have it but at theirs how our not this here above as now how below through me its most all each just before under above down am itself a is ours when of above no each be such for yourself be his further he our having too in having she as been than s again again has theirs s can when her through after very my her herself until herself or which and s as what he because in by when which not and can themselves so itself being whom our then by how very both each just during being hers i we myself because of will where and those through not what i do in no them between in about both from no own while between ours myself each how very into his yourselves again t or not both yourself had him because each my not not nor on of be me very each will it while through than as its while we i here have me theirs which only so above have nor which before them can as myself again whom when been too from after their why until theirs until such being here yourselves after whom before is a him be what as we all above both some ours my yourself an few nor below all an this their them they only they him theirs where some for through than you from in will he himself what what other how these it for in between an just if will some all should as will you who under into after too when not and do themselves do did himself should than once after down she can at after few this s both who after do during myself s will during she we so to is between own where i which he did now they most did having itself while your not again down its why is over your had again few and against it as any nor herself down very yours all them when once of their who there himself had against my its under to have because at over each have all off where above what as who
