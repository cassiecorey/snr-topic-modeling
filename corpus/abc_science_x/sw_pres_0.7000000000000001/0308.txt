elephants , snakes and octopus tentacles have inspired a new type of flexible robot a robot with a flexible , trunk - like arm could one day work like an elephant to grasp unwieldy loads , say its developers . it could also navigate like a snake through the rubble of a disaster zone , or feel around inside the dark crevasses of other planets . conventional robots have rigid joints ; picture a crane - like appendage with a claw - shaped hand . but the octarm ' s nimble design allows it to move freely and adapt to its surroundings . " these robots are invertebrate robots and are good at getting into tight spaces and wriggling around ," says ian walker , a professor of electrical and computer engineering . his team at clemson university in south carolina has been working on the project for nearly 10 years . conventional robots work best when given a predictable job in a structured setting , such as a factory assembly line . but in the unpredictable , unstructured environment of a disaster zone or the surface of a distant planet , a more flexible robot is needed . walker and a team of researchers from eight institutions in the us and israel built a strong , dexterous robotic arm that uses tubes pumped with compressed air to mimic the muscles that control tongues , trunks and tentacles . a scientist uses a joystick to the control the octarm , which resembles an elephant trunk : thick at the base and tapered toward the tip . a computer responds to the joystick ' s motions by changing the air pressure inside individual tubes . for example , to move the octarm from the extended position into a coiled shape , air pressure must be increased in the tubes on the side of the arm facing up . simultaneously , air pressure decreases in the tubes on the downward - facing side of the arm . the force of increased air pressure on one side of the arm pulls it into the coiled position . to extend it again , the scientists apply air pressure the other way around . curling and lifting more complicated motions , such as curling around an object and lifting , require more sophisticated computer algorithms . developing these algorithms is one of the bigger challenges facing walker and his team . in field tests , the octarm successfully grasped balls and pieces of wood , even clinging to them , while submerged in rushing water . " the octarms are not precise or positional , but they are compliant and flexible and can conform to crazy shapes and do some things that traditional robots can ' t ," says shane farritor , associate professor of mechanical engineering at the university of nebraska - lincoln . later this year , walker and his team will be working to improve the octarm ' s precision , adding sensors and a camera . each which same were them who been from ourselves under me down has that down i why being am our a out above up am such there be about herself against being its be yours some while theirs being nor only he own not they should below here until has being as all ourselves to doing until me again where is does why me hers how when will you himself while further doing too no most this our under and which you for against by i each in his am down off once in while you don yourself all they t herself if from down so does myself he as until which why you very because me there himself ours the then ourselves up just from they very which very with his is do some or yourself hers some then through those of to these other these i our some did itself some am are again will where does all are does is myself into is off am who they at be doing ours and against before so whom don once was yourselves between very both herself if both then because that hers own been which until our of down him having was he same all against am we itself other few himself both once their don where about a he through who now both and up only only again once i with having than yourselves if off during your this yours when below some having in these again before having because from now themselves these few between them themselves or these has had been here any just once some when into which a which hers both ours it your over yourselves than any this whom both they can off again have yourselves out can if other yours into being himself most once will in were over these does all each doing during before myself himself a what he been who yours to t into not under you own having most my too no of her into can when should our how is who both this their my been up any all having while herself what further hers you themselves that than only from under was did after above they ourselves am and myself off has she his they i does had each itself she who do further here too they over them t yourself until down who herself until than about most doing ourselves they that that had why his you up at it and all whom below am then up below itself itself from before there but they hers s their of he other now nor off he before in himself theirs when few are have my into these through is were yourselves any ourselves why where which on few some she above through to these are he your have once myself than or while there once other by with until themselves below its does or how from will this other each when been so if only whom off himself we s after about being theirs for while off theirs how under who again same was and on what those only does against now at doing off has why for it only further had how only too both by theirs up there out been our yourselves all where too at when than as
