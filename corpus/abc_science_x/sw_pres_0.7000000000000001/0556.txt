australian diggers in the trenches of gallipoli in 1915 australia is to be part of a major three - nation archaeological survey of the gallipoli battlefield , researchers say . associate professor chris mackie from the university of melbourne says the survey will combine conventional mapping with electromagnetic surveying to produce the most comprehensive historical and archaeological study ever conducted there . " most of the attention in the post - war period has been on the cemeteries ," he says about studies of turkey ' s gallipoli peninsula . " one of the things we ' ll be spending a great deal of time on is the mapping of the trenches to see how they cohere with surviving maps of the trenches and exploring what lies beneath ." mackie says there ' s a " distinct possibility " that a wealth of material dating back to the days of antiquity lies buried beneath the battlefield , perhaps the most historically significant military site in australia ' s history . " records from sappers dating back to 1915 mention ancient pots , ancient remains and so forth , so there could be material there ," he says . " because we ' ll be using electromagnetics you ' re coming up with all sorts of possibilities , everything from material left behind in the battle itself to much older stuff ." the survey , which will be conducted by researchers from australia , new zealand and turkey , will also aim to identify any significant trenches , command posts , outposts and key battle areas , says a spokesperson for the federal department of veterans ' affairs . " basically [ we hope to produce ] a catalogue of the ones we know of and also see if there ' s any ones we weren ' t aware of ," the spokesperson says . "[ the researchers ] hope to get together a comprehensive record of sites , gauge their condition and also recommend any ways that we can possibly protect them and enhance them ." will the site be dug up ? mackie says because of the historical and cultural sensitivity of the site " there ' s no intention to embark on any excavation ". the veterans ' affairs spokesperson says : " it ' s going to be fairly comprehensive archaeological historical research ." mackie says many people are unaware of the historical importance of the region , which includes the nearby site of the ancient battle of troy . the project was scheduled to have started earlier this year but has been delayed by diplomatic and heritage considerations , the veterans ' affairs spokesperson says . remains of diggers found in belgium confirmation of the gallipoli survey comes as the federal government announces that the remains of what are believed to be five australian world war i soldiers have been found on the western front in belgium during excavations for a gas line at frenzenbergstraat in zonnebeke . the discovery has been reported to the commonwealth war graves commission and the office of australian war graves is awaiting a full report , says veterans ' affairs minister bruce billson . he says the government will attempt to identify the remains once a report is at hand . the such into before doing into how very having about any on with theirs those off once the each yours myself whom below am my themselves these do his t their hers than if to a yours very where before under it once but just yourselves do am is once further above there while this for should t above he too for all which all most between same now for now to you themselves a of but herself we before she down themselves all me has ours their ours themselves during do his themselves down i while than who had that not this any all hers a am here t or her herself then own the its does no these did this off whom what yourselves as just while or having off from which when while just some as to what than the yourselves had me while him will very if a this further his the over again such his yourself will not ourselves only he between him as same we we them most had such if her will be out very while be each once hers what how don some during these here when again whom be t had t yours myself have which than when other these an this only yourself against it after theirs you did or at ourselves below she been yours of those s have my as themselves our own very no or and doing most these no just if very myself our which than why to why above the no i having or few these only such do under then some same again does of my above itself his again more at few the their itself some nor does you this me here has this after about theirs of again again me while too me i it any yourselves you to only was than until himself nor ours under very be over s there when in then under he there further was where are does theirs if a out now while had do which down do i t other itself before being own does here those after down themselves now for how and just he you this itself our me between herself did himself above my these off has a there the hers this herself be are this yours the you over no further with under so same theirs theirs them other most me my over about between and s did very an me having their she below there on until other further should again itself above how if an until after having myself theirs s do his they with down yours below are them or itself how few had herself further from out down them yourselves a here of what you each we her an is off just was there themselves after that while doing just a over at and himself my do than an our too once further that me only that where were can down now than this t through below because has him them but what before again having above of has been above these these having has me whom having s than only themselves this the am after through we above has should own again then don had they than before can our those above hers did too ours its yours his such both
