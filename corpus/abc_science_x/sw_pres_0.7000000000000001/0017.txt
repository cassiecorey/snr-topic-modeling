nanoparticles may rescue us from the drudgery of cleaning the bathroom cleaning bathrooms could become a chore of the past with new coatings on bench surfaces , tiles and glass that do the job for you , say australian researchers . professor rose amal of the arc centre for functional nanomaterials and team are developing new coatings they hope will be useful for self - cleaning surfaces in homes and hospitals . " if you can have self - cleaning materials , you can do the job properly without having to use disinfectants and other chemicals ," says amal , based at the university of new south wales in sydney . tiny particles of titanium dioxide up to 20 nanometres in diameter are currently used on outdoor surfaces , such as self - cleaning windows . these titanium dioxide nanoparticles absorb uva light , ultraviolet light below 380 nanometres in wavelength . this excites electrons and gives the particles an oxidising ability more powerful than chlorine bleach . the nanoparticles can then kill microbes and break down organic compounds from vehicle and industrial emissions into carbon dioxide and water . surfaces coated with the titanium dioxide nanoparticles also have another property , called ' superhydrophilicity ' that helps them self - clean . this is when water does not form droplets , but rather runs straight off the surface , washing as it goes . changing the activating light but titanium dioxide can only be activated by uva and this is only present in sunlight , not other sources of light , like indoor light . this means that to date self - cleaning coatings have been limited to outdoor surfaces . amal and team have been modifying titanium dioxide nanoparticles so they can absorb light at higher wavelengths , in the visible spectrum , over 400 nanometres in wavelength . they have been doping titanium dioxide nanoparticles with a small amounts of other elements such as iron or nitrogen , in place of titanium or oxygen . lab trials show that glass coated with the new nanoparticles can be activated by visible light from a lamp to kill bacteria escherichia coli , and degrade volatile organic compounds . " if you can coat it onto a shower room , you don ' t have to clean the shower room that often ," says amal . " because of the oxidising properties , fungus will also not grow on the surface ." outdoor coatings could benefit too while amal says the self - cleaning coatings would be useful on tiles , glass screens and benches in bathrooms and hospitals , she says the nanoparticles could also be used to improve outdoor self - cleaning surfaces . uva only makes up 5 % of sunlight , she says , whereas the ability to use visible light would significantly increase the amount of sunlight that could be used . " if you use this material outdoors you can utilise more of the sunlight wavelengths ," she says . funding so far has been through the australian research council but amal says her team will be looking for commercial support down the track . she expects it will be another year before the nanoparticles will be ready for large - scale production . safety considerations amal says recent concerns about the toxicity of nanoparticles should not apply to those in the self - cleaning coatings because they are chemically glued to surfaces with polyethylene glycol , and so are not free to float in the air . " for this particular application i don ' t think it should be a problem ," she says . himself no for so what out with how how ourselves both against do yours your i where to being nor itself such be further only very himself on which during will are by are up was themselves not where themselves there her when did this while about now who down am nor itself are few it and own few how hers most been do a it about here why own am he once him nor why if each an or he is had or myself until yourselves t because were while your our theirs him he being have such yourself other into will against don who his will with doing who have after a there be too having doing too above s having here until hers some being here such s why myself hers what here out had because has the they yours most in no because t each other been should here they had to her does too his itself herself why have which that was all when has that about other any again up no a don same a with more their before s what don can other few where was them here off through up hers nor these while being doing up should she now my not but should with a through is been himself my a now before an too yourselves by themselves or no nor why i them am yours on what before itself has why i over were hers being is and now until some too where our too do ours they him and in where too them your after that he again at been from so where have there will are t why yours here very him did at there doing their doing such which with why that was through about yourself itself be themselves most had it too she of t other because under between from your of such don was which down having did more by if both which we then that we is such under once above this too had her an only an below no down what by been from me on just our all had s been again herself yourselves be after some what all my few both under with further did below been below she out until yourselves both above with other she about now under all those t has i is there no him how i but a a now being from again as under himself a under between should s ourselves don at through through are ours below am my theirs my at between such her here too and again did itself what both only i or very at did as s have he only here our has has ourselves having theirs its had is having been out t himself while been into until as down this what to can don he those own don were both herself then me they our than myself for their having by after where don her over until too under such more been again to should now yourselves again it once whom more now that out yours his yourself nor yourselves through myself only don a very it hers here it other she be down into being until ours should if have be how themselves me down while if theirs of which itself nor your what after our over too to been between most his they here who nor after of with at now very whom been be they over in own myself yourself between him but as than hers has their why here same to once my through so should whom by once no s so each you same until each should such by the whom having my such ours so than yourselves more me them yourself i in are being
