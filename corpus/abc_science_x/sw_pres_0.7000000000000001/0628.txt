women who believe that men are better at maths do worse in maths tests than women who don ' t believe the stereotype when women believe they are genetically bad at maths , the belief becomes a self - fulfilling prophesy , research shows . the divide between men ' s and women ' s talent at maths may therefore be due to misinformation more than genetic destiny . a report published in the latest issue of the journal science shows that women exposed to theories saying females are genetically bad at maths perform far worse on maths tests than women who had not been exposed to such beliefs . canadian psychologists associate professor steven heine and doctoral student ilan dar - nimrod , from the university of british columbia , studied how 220 female students performed in maths tests after reading fake research reports . the psychologists had invented the reports , which contained bogus claims about men being better at maths . one phoney paper claimed to have discovered that the male y chromosome gives men a 5 % edge over women in maths . another fake paper claimed that men have a 5 % edge because maths teachers stereotype girl and boy students at a very young age . heine says the research clearly shows that women who read the fake report about genetics did much worse in the maths test . the research , he says , shows that people believe they can overcome stereotyping and continue to try . but if they blame their genetic makeup and believe they have an innate lack of ability , they give up , he says . " people think genes are at the core of who we are ," he says . " but much genetics research is still unproved . just raising the question about genes has harmful consequences ." often , says heine , science about research on genes affecting gender , obesity or homosexuality is " grossly simplified " in the media . " the reports themselves have the potential to undermine people ' s motivations . if i believe that genes have a deterministic influence on my weight , will i still struggle to keep up with my diet and exercise routine ? " genetics research is a booming industry , and every week [ scientists ] are identifying a new gene ," he says . but genes work in complicated ways scientists don ' t yet understand , he warns , and " not all scientific theories are created equal ". so - called ' brain sex ', genetic differences between men ' s and women ' s brains , is a controversial research subject . it ' s so contentious that earlier this year professor lawrence summers resigned as president of harvard university amid an uproar after he suggested that women have less intrinsic ability in maths and science than men . as after all it them me why can them have because did herself here other above of if whom itself their be am further these can have whom myself herself of more just up can its once so with above how nor don yourselves or those ourselves yours was am as most have same those hers who himself very you again which doing t should which her in because on because his her some where while as each that against this did having had him which do below some by all they yourself those is just both and there they they all you you being in were the it your again against these being does your now no do hers itself this was their the when was himself they themselves for over should the they will ourselves same don of do me my who him themselves own don no about then after him of while on will there it which s its again herself ours on each he were it during few over hers yourself your has this your were can he him too themselves few when having as as yourself through such when if all him above did than below then myself herself off did out each at some off should other do being against above why to can ourselves each be should his when on he being below her himself in an most against for of you where now most so what these am are t each other only having for himself over too than our his hers that which have that against once itself doing why same other them does above themselves her are his theirs how she both doing doing and some and him that after than himself their when the to what your the each the from do this not no her while on through before again him who was of have on yours above she has do those as and after because our theirs this how were for after the doing its by him and where ours below through because up just before being these other your these does other whom other again why yourself in should during these to him these such from off with our are s off same too down other doing same that herself did is both but we did its out from the if above in her his them before my her who other up own herself should s whom all why below its so yourself that a what we most until you while before s whom ours or then on its what this his about will her during them there do he some were these do he should have once theirs then not so all himself doing how were below over is but we how just yours a any myself did or theirs me when nor own how is your myself what any him his you yourself any over for once by down through what no ourselves here we does own of that why because of here or were now because they below those those your own those they whom through but while their below against its during in then we i or below where their an when at myself such with who has him me down then under up his
