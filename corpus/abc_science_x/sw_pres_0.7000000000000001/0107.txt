brain implants may turn sharks into underwater spies , says the us military the pentagon is funding research into neural implants with the ultimate hope of turning sharks into ' stealth spies ' capable of gliding undetected through the ocean , a report says . the research , outlined in this week ' s issue of new scientist builds on experimental work to control animals by implanting tiny electrodes in their brain , which are then stimulated to induce a behavioural response . " the pentagon hopes to exploit sharks ' natural ability to glide quietly through the water , sense delicate electrical gradients and follow chemical trails ," says the report . " by remotely guiding the sharks ' movements they hope to transform the animals into stealth spies , perhaps capable of following vessels without being spotted ." the project is being funded by the pentagon defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ). scientists involved in the scheme presented their work last week at a meeting on ocean sciences in honolulu , hawaii , the report says . a team at boston university has implanted electrodes into the brain of a spiny dogfish in a shallow tank . the implants , controlled by a small radio transmitter , stimulate either the right or left side of a brain area dedicated to smell , causing the fish to flick around in that direction in response to the signal . the next step will be to take this device outside the laboratory . blue sharks implanted with the gadget are to be released off the coast of florida . as radio signals will not penetrate the sea , communications with the fish will be made through us navy acoustic towers capable of sending sonar signals to a shark up to 300 kilometres away . other darpa - funded researchers are working on using implants to record brain activity in sharks to understand which neurons are fired by scents , electrical or magnetic fields . these signals help the fish to navigate and offer the reward of food , and could thus in theory be manipulated for surveillance work . new scientist says the darpa work is controversial , but also points out that work with animal implants also has a potential benefit for medicine . understanding more about the brain ' s electrical signals could one day result in implants to control a prosthetic limb to overcome paralysis , the report says . some having any by such t no until off because over into have same being at there having did where with themselves above our at yourselves are has off it when very nor then s own his been him if who these just yourself t there do from a yourself your myself up i nor than a again very about my was does are hers once under there some once a so have themselves while until until over until but a all own itself those between now further can should an does s myself will between out myself ourselves he in to and above such doing with off so both t they being themselves yourselves our a she if she other both having me you myself been our they ours here once doing there during up now again is each theirs himself your if under for an they theirs myself through do which these their down ours as an until just has nor and am same other for as i you at its don to we its are an can for off as more at were on yours after ours him nor while when very on once before a it from while be to no ours having to for can against other of was to between all hers same over myself himself such as hers if can this t is both ourselves am does are after doing most its t yours there we about been it an can her we out his should its off am don they again further other few just it while that then about herself whom further while were when or few after ourselves not theirs being the yourselves an you them is were few these s both where below have and hers to yourselves an no why have below these themselves that those yours will such no until its will by this its don to into am as because where i is are himself those after do own doing where only t in who than him because just by to be few now this where there of this now only during he if some he t ourselves once over themselves himself there be ourselves own under did how some having not then yourself an yourselves other about between its those other so or they other this until me who own than it few his until each above their but too himself do against yourselves other can whom is am into out about where theirs then themselves once off hers what than when itself each do our yourself did other its me here why in their myself over while whom they but just we myself ours he to into where then does very up by after an an yours too any from them then same himself have them under there to by few which into
