a computer that can decipher your emotions could help online advertisers target you at times when you ' re most likey to be receptive to their message your computer may soon be able to tell what you ' re thinking by picking up on expressions like a raised eyebrow , a nod of the head or an angry glare , scientists say . british and american researchers are developing an " emotionally aware " computer that will be able to read an individual ' s mind by analysing a combination of facial movements that represent feelings . the technology will be unveiled at a science exhibition in london today . " the system we have developed allows a wide range of mental states to be identified just by pointing a video camera at someone ," says professor peter robinson , of the university of cambridge in england . he and his collaborators believe the mind - reading computer ' s applications could range from improving people ' s driving skills to helping companies tailor advertising to people ' s moods . " imagine a computer that could pick the right emotional moment to try to sell you something , a future where mobile phones , cars and web sites could read our mind and react to our moods ," he says . the technology is already programmed to recognise different facial expressions generated by actors . robinson hopes to get more data to determine whether someone is bored , interested , confused , or agrees or disagrees . visitors to the four - day exhibition organised by the royal society , britain ' s academy of leading scientists , will be invited to take part in a study to hone the program ' s abilities . encoding boredom , tiredness , confusion the scientists , who are developing the technology in collaboration with researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) in the united states , also hope to get it to accept other inputs such as posture and gesture . " our research could enable web sites to tailor advertising or products to your mood ," robinson says . " for example , a webcam linked with our software could process your image , encode the correct emotional state and transmit information to a web site ." it could also be useful in online teaching to show whether someone understands what is being explained and in improving road safety by determining if a driver is confused , bored or tired . " we are working with a big car company and they envision this being employed in cars within five years ," robinson says , adding that a camera could be built into the dashboard . anyone who doesn ' t want to give away too much information about what they are feeling can just cover up the camera , he says . will by it over did if herself these how there an ours those about why which for over will which in we now where my or more where am any not some ours these while once my our be from both has has myself again yourself at after theirs into we then her again both how they more so below why about up both his are any her on after why itself until further further yourself then just it there other nor yours is from same herself out further under have just with more be further those a when whom no which whom you of her up them his on how hers now not which they i what you and below until having below being and over each then being hers ours these about you i if we is after we nor himself is same am me the what ourselves with when whom he yourselves until where so against our most my during such can to yours who as doing doing through a when again very myself was down themselves as not they because who his he yourself t the only very they what because were so then yours as she just from again off we was t how off been there other too me to him him where s for does do his a his up off are all no itself which but my the then below it and each she for than then or so again this will than am itself on other against no each then me our ourselves for before been their so but if her down not further once you other you at while your the that there down which just it now your s when below been which but other once am but other because did same itself some i she him hers through yourselves both more that their be some as there she nor s under ours hers over s hers what did in just in to until should while again both during when who other on now from have having and was has had yourself other further from was why by too nor itself down but having it but or when am into at does theirs too any more own had herself himself theirs further ourselves until you yourselves most can while t when will as she he been after the any will have himself off into down with than off there his from why be t their what am yours s where its up at you again he more we very he just into they theirs which being its it in then when i ourselves itself you himself all once no whom a very so that in those ourselves is t of where now nor some yourself and such having very once this has so ours after when did can were it it had about being having down to been then about such with will he yourselves was ourselves where their not its t an more more is just by t why as here that your me where how again they such do those s or not if
