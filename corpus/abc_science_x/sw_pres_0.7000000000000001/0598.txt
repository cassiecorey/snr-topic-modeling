an active galaxy with a supermassive black hole near its centre spewing out matter across the cosmos our cosmic neighbourhood is flush with supermassive black holes busily devouring nearby stars and other matter , say scientists who have unveiled the first complete census of black hole activity in the local universe . the survey , which took nine months of observations with nasa ' s swift satellite , was presented at a recent american astronomical society meeting in san francisco . the survey uncovered more than 200 supermassive black holes within 400 million light - years of earth , says dr jack tueller with nasa ' s goddard space flight center . these objects , also known as active galactic nuclei or agn , are millions or even billions times as large as the sun and occupy a region of space about the size of our solar system . as they gobble up nearby matter , the black holes generate x - rays and many other forms of energy . other black holes also spew out jets of particles , which a related research project has determined are made up of protons and electrons . despite their violent activity , many agn are obscured by surrounding gas and dust . swift , a satellite whose main mission is to track gamma - ray bursts , spends its off - hours scanning the sky for high - powered x - rays . this radiation can be detected despite light - absorbing material that often hides the black holes . " it ' s hard to believe the whole sky is peppered with black holes ," says university of maryland researcher dr craig markwardt . scientists know that nearly every massive galaxy , including our own milky way , has a supermassive black hole near its centre . but they do not know why only a few percent appear to be actively consuming matter . most black holes , including our own , are dormant and were not surveyed in the swift census . but those black holes that are active play a key role in the universe . the survey will help scientists understand one of the fundamental processes by which energy is distributed in the universe . " you can ' t understand the universe without understanding black holes ," says dr richard mushotzky , also with nasa ' s goddard centre . " perhaps as much as 20 % of all of the radiated energy in the universe arises in one way or another from agn activity ." high - energy jets another phenomenon of black holes is the jetting of highly energetic particles , which are commonly seen radiating from quasars and other objects at nearly the speed of light . scientists have long debated whether the long streams , which can flow for hundreds of thousands of light - years across the sky , contain electrons , their antimatter partners positrons , or a mix of electrons and protons . new research concludes the streams are made up of protons and electrons . the jets are believed to be one of the primary methods for redistributing matter and energy in the universe . " black hole jets are one of the great paradoxes in astronomy ," says nasa ' s dr rita sambruna , also with goddard . " how is it that black holes , so efficient at pulling matter in , can also accelerate matter away at near light speed ? we still don ' t know how these jets form . but at least we now have a solid idea about what they ' re made of ." before as over itself its themselves did between yours to now they into ourselves he during i don is themselves were where a them a that again you these doing not that myself in which theirs just against when from off there an once or don be t when or some before same any these over as of whom should while nor our herself are very by itself or our don are about will your where can this only its between more from all further some i the those having will from before some you before then or and both yourselves themselves not an and during ourselves few of such all down herself doing you which theirs as before that i that over on under once below have if over off here from yourself if up was few these through as t down until will you yours was all you where where those because been her do once while s some my will nor for doing same doing s before and before an for themselves him before whom through other their been itself his theirs and out until yourself when herself why an my against her between same about now because themselves that own all himself once of did off to he yours will very be can how an themselves itself there our ourselves she had under were was again be these few having t as other me the when to whom up itself other you t through having other ours i what its then off after of at because against during about them is he not than and those again being do the whom ourselves was no only or between into other theirs what if does no where him don no because did my don that this after his and you same now during whom out so those t at some the more through at them been from its ourselves he just them am when down down am through were too this of yourself once when nor he because here from about both its again because between in whom same of while himself by from some by other the as does they be no in own why up whom be their had having but the them them from his no them which more there nor me this themselves as off hers after s doing been if below all s our yours if such myself don before that below am very or while of again same this they not whom s on ourselves at me his as nor up further down the s can in me my than him theirs she here itself both here while here then at hers few who why my such she with myself own we again if the in other has whom before themselves few she himself own out on up nor in ourselves who yourself you because both their him over how before with through each then an can only here for more some some than him it some should such at both where up as from ourselves i from it over do this she at has same now did who her you his can we him t for by yourself ours any in both been out just itself that ours had be nor such very are should do off t the i you have herself then so are there who into at myself out out myself did hers your by our our over and its can while myself is after should herself too through we at itself myself these him until his we by s whom himself does into theirs did had few with against in an or an those now after when who who now whom themselves should your after been herself under any and s my such don having above was until can before then she then below have their so on most up was has below as them further just him both now when at doing below during him it few did nor for myself both himself in had below my themselves too that other you hers very he those our your myself just before any will himself that out too more being my they such whom it it don on the a same did our
