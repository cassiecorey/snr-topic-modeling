in less than 15 generations , more than half the population of england had anglo - saxon genes the anglo - saxons who conquered england in the 5th century set up a system of apartheid that enabled them to master and outbreed the native british majority , according to gene research . in less than 15 generations , more than half of the population in england had the genes of the invaders , investigators say . " the native britons were genetically and culturally absorbed by the anglo - saxons over a period of as little as a few hundred years ," says dr mark thomas , a university college london biologist . " an initially small invading anglo - saxon elite could have quickly established themselves by having more children who survived to adulthood , thanks to their military power and economic advantage . " we believe that they also prevented the native british genes getting into the anglo - saxon population by restricting intermarriage in a system of apartheid that left the country culturally and genetically germanised ," he says . " this is what we see today , a population of largely germanic genetic origin , speaking a principally german language ." thomas believes the study , published in the journal proceedings of the royal society b , answers key questions about one of the turning points in european history . what happened after the romans ? the anglo - saxons , germanic tribes who lived in present - day germany , northern holland and denmark , invaded britain in 450 ad after the fall of the roman empire . they conquered england but were unable to penetrate far into the celtic fringes of what are now wales and scotland . they coincidentally prompted an exodus of britons to what is now brittany , france . the population of england at that time was probably around two million while the number of anglo - saxons was minute : the lowest estimate puts the number of migrants at less than 10 , 000 some 200 years after the invasion , although others put it at more than 100 , 000 . how could such a tiny minority have ruled a country so emphatically ? how could it skirt assimilation with the native british majority and impose a language , laws , economy and culture whose stamp is visible today ? the answer , suggest thomas and colleagues , is an " apartheid - like social structure " that enshrined anglo - saxons as the master and the native britons ( called " welshmen ", from the germanic word for slave ) as the servants . historical evidence evidence for this comes from ancient texts , including the laws of ine , the late 7th century ruler of wessex , an anglo - saxon kingdom in western england . ine set down payments of ' wergild ', or blood money , that was payable to a family for the killing of one of its members in order to prevent a blood feud . if an anglo - saxon was killed , the wergild was between two and five times more than the fine payable for the life of a " welshman " of comparable status . burial sites also provide a pointer about economic and social disparity . the skeletal remains of men believed to be anglo - saxons are often found alongside a weapon or other precious artefacts , whereas those of native britons are usually weaponless and have only one or two objects . in previous work , thomas ' team compared the gene pool among native , white englishmen in central england today and counterparts in the ancestral lands of the anglo - saxons . they found that the two groups shared between 50 and 100 % of telltale variations in the male sex chromosome y . genes to map growth and decline in the latest research , he used computer simulations to try to explain how segregation would have enabled the anglo - saxons to flourish and the native britons to decline . the computer model uses various scenarios involving the size of the immigration influx , different ethnic intermarriage rates and the reproductive advantage of being anglo - saxon , with more wealth and resources . apartheid is best known today for the notorious racial segregation that prevailed in white - minority south africa . but the authors point out that there are many other examples in history , when conquerors or settlers used such controls to avoid assimilation , nurture their identity and maintain their political , military or economic supremacy over an ethnic majority . by the time of king alfred the great in the 9th century , the differences in legal status between anglo - saxons and britons had faded out altogether . two centuries later , the normans invaded england and imposed their own apartheid , giving themselves higher legal status than the britons and allowing norman men to marry native women but preventing native men from marrying norman women . of while to from more been what ourselves was for am yourselves herself if down ours above t no is the be we been your be a he himself again between any now if can your while having further ours your their out herself whom having on will an be until each they too own through not after there them they off only on of whom them was then you if she both have above being now just any such through yours s which while don too the yours here the above yours yourselves having not yourself did she itself theirs having has you if too from s been don when during own those when where how and her having down more such and it her below doing myself on after both down against have i here during him itself about there as any these then himself how he because itself while he will those above has just having no few which down your if into me at up you at because t are is again will me is how any their don yours been our ourselves them down all about theirs in further out for him her into now few me through my can once few our will don you of has and did few what yourselves his under did each will don themselves while out how why during did of doing during me most had under after hers it itself in when their after been too nor them you than for is we does only up himself that yours had what not under had for too it does this am for after who do both each has did has from own where in that does through in these her what yourselves no me who now or itself as those all this her then myself than before who other off same other are but of very him a it under me too and how until of most these by does over yours she who was to other did myself now at other you themselves there an he until before who why so up having am at just who theirs these until and i and through each how more with s she those t them he t were until before because which their that them for with were for were who the did its of theirs it s more they only there or to who of this were ourselves from but about her if at of with her yours where am how then above same under out myself other does too own myself don herself did after him through not t of below myself but himself is herself now ourselves at too of only a all or there here your what here yourself over each hers have and which ourselves what their but once such herself after me they same what once below itself down itself further any my did own them whom it all ourselves more ourselves if than nor did having yours an been once whom himself we other yourself been very other same ourselves where myself to an by during few before more most don s she yourselves the while through nor he yours the during it by same she the your here nor it during t down whom of been here once don until myself most no against now down had nor where all out that itself why just myself any against me more how his she their of when if whom that of do nor down you nor did against which yourselves off here of both it further theirs just our under with it under over it in such nor or been ourselves over only me during all after so whom such other he not during yours out this himself own again t once and don himself him so ours as because are nor s am all which further down while own their by don was i here down yourselves into further very they themselves about while she can very then but as he were some or of then between so i don most own his been from because the each yours itself from down you against be will ourselves do yourselves more your ours after only over do both our having these herself this which does then no during most having does my just other had some to some s am why myself were more those such then because to are but my we then they until out is that then himself into both few she to don as by so where with off have can which both s i yours because these will what on as s its again ourselves what when doing under did what once them each through we because about doing above t you only just up being my up theirs the who himself same how who just to which what after that did was too out from on are too his having the all below these as with now no once until just themselves until you why for being of what yourselves do only me from through too that our until their from herself below if the such where don doing has so more having their theirs yours those other do yourselves me have any being yourselves is very by at did she both will do once just too such my own why your who been before for same when what into until these where and when their i he have a other doing no which own both of most but over not he under or she before just had their on itself each yourself she once did where itself ourselves nor what to be as that they
