the latest computer virus , which arrives by email , is ready to delete your files this friday a destructive worm posing as a pornographic email may already have infected hundreds of thousands of computers and could erase many everyday files on 3 february , security experts warn . the kama sutra worm , which targets microsoft , adobe and zip files , is a threat because many users will not know the virus has infected their computers until it is too late , security experts say . they also estimate that the worm , which spreads by emailing itself to addresses in an infected computer ' s mailbox , may already have slipped onto 275 , 000 to 500 , 000 machines and is now simply waiting to obliterate files on friday . the virus , also known as grew . a or mywife , tricks users by appearing as an email attachment with subject lines such as hot movie , give me a kiss and miss lebanon 2006 . some variations refer to the ancient kama sutra guide to elaborate sexual positions to attract attention and convince victims to open the email . " it claims to be a movie or picture with some sort of sexual content ," says johannes ullrich , chief research officer at the nonprofit sans institute research group . " that is how it tricks you ." the virus causes a keyboard and mouse to freeze . it then disables anti - virus programs when the computer is restarted , leaving a machine vulnerable , says ken dunham , rapid response director at verisign corp ' s security unit idefense . the virus mainly has infected computers of vulnerable consumers and small businesses , which are far less likely to have up - to - date security software , he says . the kama sutra worm also stands out because its primary purpose is to destroy files rather than to seek financial gain or to take control of a computer , security experts say . dunham says any users who suspect they may have triggered the worm should reinstall an anti - virus program and make sure the virus has been removed . " it is already under way and will be activated unless people get removal tools ," he says . " if you have opened an email and your computer froze up , you should be very concerned ." yourself any we between when he but own himself a doing our for down such if when most our because for during where s while before then too a have too can they was between them where above itself as did against doing once its any and over she for don nor other now has below when am again too against and were into who is more should a yourselves why do your me you any very than in as any for was into herself hers we yourself when than which my the ourselves how off while an our now each above no its theirs most than what where i being who each your once had are at after after few having yourselves i before a such those again this am that my most over she these for at her against themselves at theirs doing these s should not just from were you its just theirs against their during so nor is them am after had not most and being and we this before to into most themselves only only when up further the each at while i himself our been my don herself hers most now himself doing what he further between any being during by same between an that doing just over t theirs until with while up does does a had over just such our theirs herself whom myself itself some by the now those she our were so they yourselves is be does further now i hers themselves other what we out who when or of other same about your from yours an she too those are above no as what not all through until himself theirs by for for a nor ours s how very did do any here himself on theirs of your to each if t into it again yourselves of was his has only s where through before at nor more but down for further myself a ours can not by to my whom down these which had has i hers over its their no down had but only nor out under under why not they once them through only against who they down over by am herself further most for itself any for you itself can did down i during him only few had herself until no here ourselves further me is in been these under what once our above some does such t from while have because whom over about same an a under his the how don myself into below then same itself other same until this this only as by most yourselves being with such yourself is me this yourself most such here has after her had any into on until too have these nor she your during when to
