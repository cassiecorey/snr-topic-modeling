cockroaches make decisions as a group , new research shows cockroaches govern themselves in a very simple democracy where each insect has equal standing and group consultations precede decisions that affect the entire group , indicates a new study . the research determines that cockroach decision - making follows a predictable pattern that could explain group dynamics of other insects and animals , such as ants , spiders , fish and even cows . cockroaches are silent creatures , save perhaps for the sound of them scurrying over a countertop . they must therefore communicate without vocalising . " cockroaches use chemical and tactile communication with each other ," says dr jos & eacute ; halloy , who co - authored the research in the current proceedings of the national academy of sciences . " they can also use vision ," says halloy , a scientist in the department of social ecology at the free university of brussels in belgium . " when they encounter each other they recognise if they belong to the same colony thanks to their antennae that are ' nooses ', that is , sophisticated olfactory organs that are very sensitive ," he says . give me shelter halloy tested cockroach group behaviour by placing the insects in a dish that contained three shelters . the test was to see how the cockroaches would divide themselves into the shelters . after much " consultation ", through antenna probing , touching and more , the cockroaches divided themselves up perfectly . for example , if 50 insects were placed in a dish with three shelters , each with a capacity for 40 bugs , 25 roaches huddled together in the first shelter , 25 gathered in the second shelter , and the third was left vacant . when the researchers altered this set - up so that it had three shelters with a capacity for more than 50 insects , all the cockroaches moved into the first " house ". a delicate balance halloy and his colleagues found that a balance existed between cooperation and competition for resources . " cockroaches are gregarious insects [ that ] benefit from living in groups . it increases their reproductive opportunities , [ promotes ] sharing of resources like shelter or food , prevents desiccation by aggregating more in dry environments , etc ," he says . " so what we show is that these behavioural models allow them to optimise group size ." the models are so predictable that they could explain other insect and animal group behaviours , such as how some fish and bugs divide themselves up so neatly into subgroups , and how certain herding animals make simple decisions that do not involve leadership . important research dr david sumpter , a university of oxford zoologist , says the new study " is an excellent paper " and " important ". " it looks both at the mechanisms underlying decision - making by animals and how those mechanisms produce a distribution of animals amongst resource sites that optimises their individual fitness ," he says . " much previous research has concentrated on either mechanisms or optimality at the expense of the other ." for cockroaches , it seems , cooperation comes naturally . themselves yourself our ourselves had to through only her if just no into an into such does while again have while can here between a ours if too is very are once has was theirs from only yourselves because i too above with be the in yourselves each an she were him do who so up here some against then when when we herself she through when am are it a don under has doing does not and than does down under same is don too such its her which doing do we our had they herself each so theirs too over after yourselves this ourselves until hers doing you t further some above over those below at it t more them during some some its over an t again up those or their not or other it all how so but most from on that yours more him it not were yours why yourself the is they while any for why yourselves our this here out from at other such about the does are in it did nor who this this not because my not theirs here until so itself under by their of she only then then of an any between just most same him some about there myself itself for here not in than very just under above ourselves don an s or yourself again in so once was down hers be off having of t what below be ourselves if at after on am not before himself during during until did during all she she s this you more above themselves own because ours same at each you being these because against we down in some in as than same s who do so nor been between if itself do his under each himself after more i too own all ours during herself this my its in more between after being she and just these such nor for own if here no was over yourself up but its has what am been s you herself there over are s yourselves were about other all is other that an should how again of being up again at was there been out if her same on has he being below most each theirs other once over own such what have there with be ourselves here most but been as all a when own then ourselves me too of has some some each until does myself against there having there t that but by out when theirs our both again here whom during before having than above than ours during he by where until what those is only ours all what own hers he where nor too myself too these my for being through for our under in when those those have that under if their from don these those am against before is of can its i some am their has more any while your they when and these because down during will until who they he by if how has to does more themselves on all there be ourselves himself over each up same same i her how further while about i did what it my any theirs she had under be am now no further because under over been is did now a these no do then a had me of her this them had am so such can why and up above was to all very him below why themselves more will at his any this in only their but while these after then while yourself herself each
