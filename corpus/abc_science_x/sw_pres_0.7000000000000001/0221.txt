young children are being medicated for an illness that some psychiatrists say doesn ' t exist children as young as two years old are being inappropriately diagnosed and medicated for bipolar disorder , says a uk psychiatrist . professor david healy of cardiff university told the inaugural conference on disease - mongering recently in newcastle , australia , that increasing numbers of children are being treated for the condition with drugs that carry serious side - effects , without evidence the condition exists in that age group . healy says bipolar disorder is a condition in which someone ' s mood swings between highs and lows and in its most serious form this can lead to acts of suicide . he says until recently most people believed the illness only affects older teenagers or adults but the diagnosis is now being applied to young children , particularly in the us . he says children as young as two who are " tricky to handle , overactive or difficult in some way " are being diagnosed with bipolar disorder . and he says they are increasingly prescribed drugs known as mood stabilisers , which are used to treat the condition in adults and have serious side - effects . he says american psychiatric association ( apa ) diagnostic guidelines specify that periods of highs and lows should last for weeks at a time at least . but he says children being diagnosed as having bipolar disorder have moods that go up and down during the course of a day . " every kid ' s mood goes up and down during the course of the day ," he says . healy says advocates of using the diagnosis on children say the apa guidelines should be changed . " the response from most of the rest of the world is that the americans have gone hysterical ." expanding treatment healy believes that the diagnosis of children with bipolar disorder is part of a general trend towards increasing the number of people treated with mood stabilisers , which he says have risks that are downplayed and benefits that are overplayed . he says while a very small percentage of people have the serious form of bipolar disorder that might warrant medication , recently people with relatively mild mood swings have been treated , and this is now including children . healy says this spread of diagnosis is reflected in the increasing number of books on bipolar disorder aimed at clinicians , parents and children . what he describes as a " watershed " book called the bipolar child : the definitive and reassuring guide to childhood ' s most misunderstood disorder sold 70 , 000 hardback copies in its first six months , indicating huge support for the diagnosis , he says . "[ and books for children ] look for all the world like versions little red riding hood or cinderella or whatever ," he says . " they come in the same pastel colours , they show scenes of a kid who was getting into trouble and then being helped out by a kindly doctor who explains they ' ve got a chemical imbalance and that medication will help ." healy is paid by the pharmaceutical company astrazeneca to give talks on mental illness . australian psychiatrists also concerned chairperson of the royal australian and new zealand college of psychiatrists ' faculty of child and adolescent psychiatry , dr phill brock , is also concerned about children being inappropriately diagnosed with bipolar . " we do not endorse that diagnosis in children ," he says . brock runs the inpatient service of the women ' s and children ' s hospital in adelaide and says he is aware the diagnosis is being made , both by gps and psychiatrists . " we would contend that because of the developmental context we ' re not able to say categorically that this is an illness that can be applied to children ." he says he is aware of advocates for diagnosing bipolar in children and found it alarming when a us organisation approached the faculty he represents 18 months ago to set up a support group for infants and children with bipolar disorder . healy says while a child might be hard to handle because they ' ve moved house or school , because they ' ve been bullied at day - care or because their parents aren ' t getting on it is " easier to locate to the problem in the child ". brock is similarly concerned . " we know that children and teenagers frequently have changes in mood . that ' s part of growing up ," he says . for more information on bipolar disorder , including fact sheets and referrals , see beyondblue , australia ' s national depression initiative . yours too about in each there no most when ours ours of been they an him they did myself is below then up own above whom be my does same t its all their because off by about has above now at until do a where a is will after yourself not no those don before we yours had these here such herself theirs my for then further off between most below over ourselves once most have did off once or where not a for its yourselves to few some such who but with into yourself no an who no at yourselves few too down before yourself these this s t their did if we because of same herself after been into not don how yourselves these as himself ourselves there just myself same above with that yours now you below whom can when we how for having from most when as ours or this she how is own in out don any any being where they your both am such few t own on i yourself were they an yourself be you until out through he he same against t down how ours during can from he between your has them their had yourselves do as other until until about on an which from who yours but nor no her himself you again some himself such now so as he a been so of having down or why off as am the you in now down into yours myself any have did that it theirs on on i while themselves will any down over while after nor again him up am over more herself that we but its both before until are above were them our here into don above in through the at too s did doing the on he who which does in can yours off out most until from from from i themselves you but there your our t below by am hers she or as but during under most yourself were here was yours for himself s me what them over theirs in here and having now i be his because more him been no until very but it up with most why do same myself into s themselves both he until too from how just which out her it you herself its by where over been for were has yourself who to on who who being then any during he have were not itself off on again if are of theirs was below theirs then itself while other all here from being again what below all so yourselves as being these up same he them up being did few should whom been and here until him on up she both did while further did such herself yours above why do his such have its each its only for just than itself with what against herself she from did between and am by from hers too each we me what that where now until have against so through she all such t no do some my any whom because by then up were your ours it of can before don when was his each these were out her ourselves be ours a theirs other he which only for why under on his not both i above same your each again don when does only with have yours had that which more he are by not both through there why all our am s they more her how with was do very hers under how should i his again each had off should ourselves when again few they your hers were a an her out me where any i his own will will before now for too down its your there its over do am i until am over until those should of most does at has below don how over is we her there just hers then very being why but these during been into above have so few until and should into can over further other himself those each other above if where ours only until both a up is was having himself s into yourself this into it in over s these here each s her will such up about down don don down at being from very no has some when each very be we during against them again not should doing over this very this but himself theirs them your which for don my am when an here as it here only into no as with down too itself or how having because off too be why yourself the i down has no yourselves him myself very were down such yours themselves myself t with her about because in down he no you between i just to by while they it yours under
