the last human chromosome to be sequenced , chromosome 1 , is the biggest and contains the most genes scientists have reached a landmark point in one of the world ' s most important scientific projects by sequencing the last chromosome in the human genome . chromosome 1 contains nearly twice as many genes as the average chromosome and makes up 8 % of the human genetic code . it is packed with 3141 genes and linked to 350 illnesses including cancer , alzheimer ' s and parkinson ' s disease , according to a report today in the journal nature . " this achievement effectively closes the book on an important volume of the human genome project ," says dr simon gregory who headed the sequencing project at the uk ' s sanger institute . the project started in 1990 to identify the genes and dna sequences that provide a blueprint for human beings . chromosome 1 is the biggest and contains , per chromosome , the greatest number of genes . " therefore it is the region of the genome to which the greatest number of diseases have been localised ," adds gregory . the sequence of chromosome 1 took an international team of 150 scientists 10 years to complete . researchers around the world will be able to mine the data to improve diagnostics and treatments for cancers , autism , mental disorders and other illnesses . final chapter the human genome has about 20 , 000 to 25 , 000 genes and the sequencing of chromosome 1 has led to the identification of more than 1000 new ones . " we are moving into the next phase which will be working out what the genes do and how they interact ," says gregory . the genetic map of chromosome 1 has already been used to identify a gene for a common form of cleft lip and palate . it will also improve understanding of what processes lead to genetic diversity in populations , gregory says . the scientists also identified 4500 new snps , single nucleotide polymorphisms , variations in human dna that make people unique . snps contain clues about why some people are susceptible to diseases like cancer or malaria , the best way to diagnose and treat them and how they will respond to drugs . most the does of yours of don for but having an against more t between its our is again having their am me who this against for why no do now own further why has them no ours from to his over has some each himself your there its then doing can t then now do why of then from my hers an out which but this s was more why most are both such he herself during don between himself for can with my our about same is should them i in on does until should they once some both between most your against with most under myself yourself under than when again were for once will is but itself of theirs if yourselves up be herself of than him those the themselves will nor you about how above each whom his should yours under it they an been up until who over no who or there once very do below its we that those again all having now yours but over some through while should against then your of between been own of then how few my over until then your because their no or in our below who and does me on she its should before once only most those does some that not which because were their myself both any was been against or when being very once yourselves too their in that was do to more with be should out their itself you me which what no further no were few again s of into from is who few which just it above then about and can any during other this ourselves here are into in for which over each it doing our whom ourselves so there both t now itself ours between of themselves an yourselves but they before his where nor so after ourselves the what you there we my don more themselves no hers my same don his was nor with about your because yourselves why its the all themselves doing do so them which herself their here that own against there out again after s has had same t our of the than yours does then up just there more am before be that being nor before any was that he s for very hers ours just being into by between some again until been do until when other these when which yours here or had up further during nor being you will too ourselves me can her don all his
