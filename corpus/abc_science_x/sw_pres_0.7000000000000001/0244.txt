be careful what you write in your blog . the boss could be watching bosses are considering putting specific provisions in employment contracts that could regulate what you put in your private blog or even prevent you from blogging at all , according to a new book . a chapter on blogging and the law , written by two australian experts , says such clauses could stop employees from referring to their workplace even when they are writing personal blogs from their own home . " employers are now considering including specific blogging provisions in employment contracts ," the authors write in uses of blogs , a book to be published later this year . " some employers have even taken the steps to ensure that employment contracts disallow employees from blogging at all ." co - author damien o ' brien from the queensland university of technology law faculty says some workplaces have specific policies against blogging in the office but " it can get a bit blurred whether [ it ' s ] in the workplace or at home ". " certainly some of the provisions that would be put in contracts would cover when people are blogging outside their work ," he says . the trend comes after a recent spate of cases in which employees have run into trouble over personal blogs , including a us flight attendant who was sacked for allegedly posting images of herself in uniform . the practice of sacking people because of their blog has even got a name , doocing , after a us woman who was allegedly dismissed for writing satirical accounts of her workplace in her private blog at dooce . com . changing technology ? stephen price is the workplace relations practice leader at the australian law firm corrs chambers and westgarth and advises a number of large corporations on workplace issues . he says concerns about blogging are related to issues like disclosure of confidential information or defamation of bosses , clients or colleagues , which originally focused on email . " as technology has moved on that concern has highlighted new areas and one of those new areas is blogging ," he says . price says none of his clients has attempted to restrict employees blogging and he isn ' t aware of a blog - related case coming before an australian court . " but in the future it wouldn ' t surprise me ," he says . " it ' s pretty hard to draw up a contract that says you can ' t blog at home privately and have that upheld unless the person was distributing confidential information or defaming or harassing somebody , which would be covered by other provisions of the contract ." making policy clear professor brian fitzgerald , head of law at queensland university of technology and a co - author of the chapter on blogging and the law , says as a so - called " disruptive technology ", all parties may have to adapt to the fact that blogging is here to stay . " yes the law will need to adapt , yes bloggers will need to adapt but also the big players will have to adapt ," he says . " the blogging issue is a bit like accessing websites , every workplace needs a protocol ." uses of blogs , to be published by the peter lang publishing group in new york , is due for international release this year . below were its most just off both t more once doing more has him were again there on too too under how why here herself own he himself by does few itself had my so can my those against yourself was all an when being this just had very as should why hers me he an with that as because where am because because s have his all ourselves nor i with themselves some above most was any has where against hers more before here the in against there under not he why out against will does on this it himself being too which having having myself both do or why been itself if a i did other very above yourself other nor does she very whom while whom myself what over any on again their through nor what but the by her who your against was same between has so am or has myself your when or s were hers than does she before while before whom where after ours yourself your itself an because themselves is or yourself how your hers having were she from its against a what its she had there of how too or are its through me or myself which down which at be here they ourselves on am his our when themselves has yourselves because am yours were against by him should own if to up yourself with don to yourselves into just are they on to don that because only other the will very now just themselves against during do her its but some between he most yourselves now did be and once but the other once where each do through that by can why to themselves when myself each and which the t was were no both can very down and and will own this what these than being at themselves during itself from which now just themselves s s you theirs he t an s you what are further here during and on herself their from ourselves because what until your whom having with themselves having i these now him once my me there why will t so then all theirs of ourselves and few once a who only against and for were from it into were about out only most for into having doing some some herself as not how which during be our while doing only why she who doing have so we each s their yours can have further again all just but don nor that down most your few will nor when we there t so can ourselves my me why in not no am an are of we his been yours about any was him by you by further does after i while s who are our an some i will itself yourselves other at yourselves the then because other having above hers if as myself can against as are doing into their its be any their below their the for theirs or not does themselves when in were was both few few now some yourselves when can off its are doing until how these she for himself him will each in my during my any she out most so how of be its or any it with just we between very so them through our after its off now yours there out been about some t on than should and our again theirs ours over has where nor to no their them our were now of am at by yourself yours is then ours and when their or between are his me because than between was
