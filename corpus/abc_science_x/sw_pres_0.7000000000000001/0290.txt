shampoos , sunscreens , toothpastes , anti - aging creams and other personal care products contain nanomaterials , a new report says consumers are using cosmetics and toiletries that contain unregulated and untested nanomaterials , says a new report . the report released this week by friends of the earth ( foe ), documents 116 products it says contain nanoparticles , a large number of which are available to australians either in stores or online . " we believe this represents a small fraction of the number of products that are actually on the market ," says georgia miller of the foe nanotechnology project . products listed in the report include well - known brands such as l ' or & eacute ; al , revlon , clinique , chanel and est√©e lauder , says miller . the nanomaterials , sunscreens and cosmetics : small ingredients , big risks report is based on publicly available information from manufacturers of the products or ingredients , or retailers , says miller . nanoparticles are generally those under 100 nanometres across and manufacturers are not required to label products containing them . there is some concern among scientists that such tiny particles may have toxic characteristics , yet there is limited scientific information available on their safety . among their concerns are whether creams and lotions containing nanoparticles can penetrate deep into the skin . skin deep ? the therapeutic goods administration ( tga ), which regulates sunscreens in australia , says the weight of current evidence is that nanoparticles used in sunscreens stay on the surface or in the outer dead layer of the skin . but miller points to the uk ' s royal society , which says the ability of nanoparticles to penetrate into the skin is still unclear . existing studies are inadequate , says miller , which is why there are numerous studies on skin penetration being carried out in the us and europe . " we think the tga ' s conclusion is very premature and irresponsible ," says miller . some manufacturers promote deeper skin penetration as a feature of their nanoparticle - enhanced products , she says , pointing to anti - ageing wrinkle creams that contain fullerenes , nanoscale carbon spheres . " they are promoting their use of fullerenes as a positive attribute because they claim that fullerenes enable much deeper penetration into the skin of the anti - ageing ingredients ," she says . " in a lot of instances it ' s the very properties that are attractive to cosmetics manufacturers , for example the ability to penetrate deeper in the skin , that are of concern to us ." she says a 2004 us scientific study found fullerenes can cause brain damage in fish , kill water fleas , and are toxic to human liver cells even in low doses . cosmetics regulator welcomes report deborah willcocks of the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment ( nicnas ), which regulates cosmetics in australia , says her organisation is " particularly pleased " to see the foe report . she says nicnas called on industry in february this year to provide data on what nanomaterials were being used and in what volume . " the friends of the earth report is the first time we ' ve actually seen some published information on what products might be on the market out there ," she says . " it ' s a good help to us ." willcocks says more data is required before nicnas can determine if nanomaterials have unique toxicological properties compared ito materials with a larger particle size . she says nicnas is meeting with its industry committee today and is proposing to set up a working group with industry and the community to develop a strategy on how to deal with nanomaterials . " we are concerned , that ' s why we ' re actually working on this very actively ," willcocks says . the body representing australia ' s cosmetics industry , accord australasia , says it has only just become aware of the foe report . executive director bronywn capanna says accord and its member companies would co - operate with the regulatory agencies should the report raise any relevant significant issues . she says examples of nanotechnology used in cosmetics and personal care products include nanoemulsions , nano - pigments and sunblocks , and nanocapsules . calls for a moratorium the uk ' s royal society recommends nanoparticles be tested and assessed as new chemicals . but regulators say it is too early to say whether specific safety tests are required . meanwhile , foe is seeking a moratorium on the production and sale of products containing nanomaterials . " our call is for a halt to the further release of products that contain nanomaterials until such time as we have done the safety assessment and we ' ve got regulations in place to manage the risks ," miller says . the public health association of australia supports foe ' s call for a moratorium . "[ there is also no ] surveillance going on to see if anything does arise out of the use of nanotechnology in things like cosmetics and sunscreens ," says executive director pieta laut . has can if
