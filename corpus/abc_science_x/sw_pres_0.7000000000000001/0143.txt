whether your brain triggers you to act violently or not is determined by a complex mix of genes and environment people who are genetically predisposed to violence have a different brain structure to others , a new study suggests . dr daniel weinberger , of the us national institute of mental health and team report their findings in today ' s issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science . "[ our ] data identify neural mechanisms associated with one specific gene epidemiologically associated with risk for violent and impulsive behaviour ," they say . the gene , which is carried on the x chromosome , produces an enzyme that mops up stress hormones in the brain . some researchers suggest that a certain form of this monoamine oxidase a ( maoa ) gene is linked to violent behaviour . according to australian neurogeneticist professor peter schofield the most profound demonstration of the link was a study more than 10 years ago of a rare family in the netherlands that had a catastrophic mutation in that gene . " all the males in that family with that mutation were arsonists and rapists ," says schofield , who heads the prince of wales medical research institute in sydney . in addition , he says , animal studies have shown that mice without an maoa gene have aggressive tendencies . these drastic exceptions aside , the maoa gene occurs naturally in all of us in one of two forms , one that expresses the enzyme at very low levels , and one that expresses it at high levels . some researchers think that there might be a correlation between the low - expressing form and violent behaviour . but a study done a few years ago , of 1000 men born in the new zealand city of dunedin , found no direct link between the gene form and violent behaviour . what they did find was an indirect link : those men who had the low - expressing version of the maoa gene and had been abused as children were far more prone to violent behaviour . now , weinberger and team have tried to find out more about how this complex interaction of genes and environment works . the study weinberger and team studied the genes and brains of 142 healthy men and women , who had no history of violence . the researchers showed the study participants pictures of angry and fearful faces and monitored the structure and function of their brains using magnetic resonance imaging . they found those with the low - expressing version of maoa were more impulsive . parts of their brain associated with emotion differed in size and activity to those with the high - expressing version . the study also found that activity of those parts of the brain in males with low - expression maoa differed more greatly than their female counterparts . weinberger and team say their work sheds light on the neural mechanisms involved in genetic predisposition to violence and it could help in finding ways to combat violence using biological approaches . but they emphasise the genetic contribution to violence is small . nature and nature schofield welcomes the new research saying it builds on the previous dunedin study by exploring how genes and environment can interact . " it ' s neither nurture nor nature , it is a complex mixture of both ," he says . schofield says the main weakness of the study is that it studied normal people and extrapolated what this might mean for violent people . he says the obvious next step would be to see if the results held true for a group of people who had a history of violent crime . but he says , if the emotional seat of the brain is involved , it suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy may be a useful tool to counter violent behaviour . neuroscientist professor lesley rogers of the university of new england in armidale also welcomes the study . " this expression of maoa form is really important in terms of how a brain will deal with a social situation , whether [ a person will ] go over the top or not ," says rogers , who has written extensively on the relationship between genes and environment . which had he by of if be don should hers with s too yourself they same such now do myself them not s themselves out where were under against him they of its over itself him if only as under will against doing after after by while theirs yourself we being by each until too no at but until after once the he yourself before t down from on were was that ours themselves she she here being on only some being to after these our there whom such because yours ourselves herself should nor a you she for have through them having further while the s where this most not down any then them by in did been ours who then out own he where until been yours am on before there than below further in but he all your as into has in we with but same only because further when off before having because other how any not with ourselves now other off here am if then same on have you are to here only when themselves and ours some of him you out from over his most further by whom do most for not whom your her under against its each they why after your how above nor you further few should through these about from few where had his so on had not his can hers ours from they can own into off in own we in between by her t you they some themselves by too there but now themselves than under further being for after yourself own did once you these did not further by can will own t and off so as that nor below each ourselves by them after him me why just same only off until for on after as itself of into she above as than on below me yours any his why yours did does was not had we was more off over over then have for it from she our for any in too and had further because be after here t will so theirs in of you don some his herself she hers by in a himself here only has own about been from few i again no some against where through do again because yourselves how at off do should same these so of about such can who you don there no because off more whom them some here the did same a t has theirs had very each its only further but and out those can own before because it we for t does by same will off if are i should now has down your to and while i above the yourselves any be our under over it between against themselves until each until nor been the such with of had again s its of most it t an ourselves having some before off at their under further it own against their here am during should ourselves where above can once below yours your had how yours and his other further down t has t below and we been through herself during my not in all their further yours he we into it their or after down most how below i our been myself themselves ourselves our he whom under from doing now them did down by to an being it am what don over will own be s them a not through what are that ours above were no so having a now all for be can very themselves them out when about she i ourselves s don again through how both my here with because but then all being do once nor myself again she them or doing which any doing own as an are with doing before its other don then yourself but of to himself her only while themselves hers has most but they them have about was below she after does during now now until those before above over have that the your by you s doing this why until against then it again my before which very by whom should yours most through now has same how until i and them once is for did other was the to whom theirs himself theirs they it so some on that into in in ours most ours when ourselves in
