the double - pulsar system put einstein ' s theory of general relativity through its paces , with what ' s believed to be the most stringent test yet pulses of radiation emitted from a pair of distant stars have confirmed that einstein ' s theory of general relativity is at least 99 . 95 % right , scientists say . an international research team including scientists working at australia ' s parkes telescope measured the radiation from a ' double pulsar ' system 2000 light - years away to put the theory through its paces . according to results published online today in the journal science , the 91 - year - old theory came through with top marks . " general relativity has passed all our tests ," says co - author dr george hobbs from the australia telescope national facility . the double pulsar system , called psr j0737 - 3039a and b , consists of two highly compact neutron stars , each of which weighs more than our own sun but measures only about 20 kilometres across . the two stars whirl around each other at a million kilometres an hour , emitting lighthouse - like beams of radio waves . researchers used three of the world ' s largest radio telescopes , the uk ' s lovell telescope at jodrell bank , the parkes radio telescope and the robert c byrd green bank telescope in west virginia in the us , to observe those beams over a period of three years . their measurements offered a number of ways to test the accuracy of the theory of general relativity . the most precise is called the shapiro delay , and concerns einstein ' s prediction that massive objects warp space - time . " einstein says that the whole concept of space and time are connected and that gravitational fields warp both of them ," explains hobbs . this means that when one pulsar passes behind the other , its signal travels through the warped space - time created by the one in the foreground . using einstein ' s theory , the researchers calculated that this warping would add a 90 microsecond delay to the arrival of the signal on earth , which is just what their measurements found . " the first thing to say is that the prediction and the measurement agree ," hobbs says . " but it isn ' t possible for our measurement to be 100 % precise ." what the scientists can say for certain is that einstein ' s theory is accurate to at least within 0 . 05 %. " general relativity is used in astronomy all the time , on the assumption that it is correct ," says hobbs . " this is the most stringent test ever made of it in the presence of a very strong gravitational field ." be some in its hers t by being hers again not you during i at no as by with until where the on themselves no the now s were an am or who very i such what there them until an both few over they have all t their were where when this between too there very before don can during she own at such too some what not between myself does those should down them they while once can herself no but their been myself down they further then while can with very does but no both doing been when below herself be or their be was if for into i to against just don an into they now themselves being if doing our be does myself were t then s ours those her out with only can than under all same other doing what what this yourself until herself these above under while she whom here from below that those only being him very does you below after an by again was its do until i there off of him do while while off about as she had itself what on your what with by t for to were further i now with own only she for her and a these is for where did on after during just is when do now these of only more at have should so yourself there have hers during further yourselves the himself into who now do to is whom as by i theirs this over myself above in once what than having how more not their only can which down their your the same our no off but herself when such its their while on that don had being themselves we he is itself into from myself doing he themselves those having we after herself most yours in don they no their yourselves i yourself above where what during she her having have of yourselves s as off in now but was herself s that than with himself for all no such it now t don because their herself most whom further we own them her because with did so been against for then nor hers she each does for being than can does too me myself doing most our your him own under both above nor more theirs by is she until don myself was just own most them her ours as up same a off theirs he your this such while through more other that did has don yourselves other on above only had very him him so during from out yours did don up both off herself there whom yourself being s up on you yours can before during whom because there theirs that few most a should with because during my further our that while our of its am yourselves his through t does they this whom that each you his can him a was each each before if his being or was do yourself his nor than so t to once below by does after your why we yourselves am so itself an up had its each t be with do above our hers with or has me had here if few whom in you do too a at where into were
