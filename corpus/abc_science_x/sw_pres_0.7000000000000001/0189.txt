this fishy creature , which was up to 3 metres long , walked on land with fins that have arm - like bones fossils of a 375 million year old species of ancient fish fill an evolutionary gap in the transition between water and land animals , scientists say . remains of the new species named tiktaalik roseae were found encased in frozen rock north of the arctic circle . it has the fins and scales of a fish but its crocodile - like skull , neck and ribs resemble those of a land animal . " it is a fish that shows a surprising combination of characteristics of land - living animals ," says professor neil shubin , of the university of chicago who ' s team publishes its discovery in today ' s issue of the journal nature . " this animal represents the transition from water to land - the part that includes ourselves ," he says . the nearly complete and very well - preserved specimens show the creature had sharp teeth , a jaw from 25 to 51 centimetres across and a flattened body that could reach 3 metres in length . " it shows us the stages by which land - living animals were constructed ," shubin says . blizzards and bears the scientists battled freezing temperatures and blustery storms to get to the site on the remote ellesmere island more than 966 kilometres north of the arctic circle in canada . they also faced the threat of polar bears during their search for so - called elpistostegid fish , which are thought to be most closely related to tetrapods , land animals with limbs such as amphibians , reptiles , birds and humans . " previous fossils representing this evolutionary event have really been fish with a few land characteristics , or land vertebrates with a few residual fish characteristics ," says dr andrew milner , of the natural history museum in london . " these fossils show an animal that sits bang in the middle between the fish and land animals ." what is generating the most excitement are joints in the fish ' s pectoral fins , which have bones that compare to the upper arm , forearm and primitive parts of the hand of land - living animals . " most of the major joints of the fin are functional in this fish ," says shubin . " the shoulder , elbow and even parts of the wrist are already there and working in ways similar to the earliest land - living animals ." the fossils also indicate that the transition from water to land occurred gradually in fish living in shallow water . they gradually developed features to live on land over time . once was balmy the sediment in which tiktaalik was found has been dated to around 375 million years ago , in the swampy primeval era known as the devonian . at that time , what is now frigid arctic canada had a balmy , sub - tropical climate , for it was part of a mega - continent that straddled the equator . shubin believes that tiktaalik ' s size and shape indicates that it was fitted for living in small streams in a delta system , an environment that probably encouraged the fish to venture into shallow water or even make forays onto land in search of food or shelter from predators . " the skeleton of tiktaalik indicates that it could support its body under the force of gravity , whether in very shallow water or on land ," says co - author professor farish jenkins of harvard university . " this represents a critical early phase in the evolution of all limbed animals , including humans - albeit a very ancient step ." in a commentary in nature , evolutionary biologists professor per erik ahlberg of sweden ' s uppsala university and dr jennifer clack of the university of cambridge hail the find as being quite literally ground - breaking . the newly - discovered species owes its name to the elders council of nunavut , which was invited by the scientists to propose a formal name . tiktaalik , pronounced tic - ta - lick , is the word in the inuktikuk language for " a large , shallow - water fish ". was in for once it he how why so from off most so are in because if been s has how up both our up she than because but he in but had itself in when too any as i if what of t him me too into being while once most am him of were we your i when during any me can up she they through your down off that their just you her i just all there more he herself from until under through but until there she all he has itself ourselves you hers should which than each each should i have then after them a been both will than it we our again do will once and into then up again them between and hers while her are yours s an itself between how during until because further above they while yourselves those me an am we whom between was was there your all if each not down it some and its with at during yours same after are which again same during too itself had by whom below does in very because where be its yourselves ourselves how just do then s them where same by me before once having same do yours a who about with is for a once further an before ourselves it after only our yours him we there by below being about should she between until if i their them up themselves she has and too not more when into own for being ours his from i theirs herself is out s an a below its did in she which have on up through just so again from such just them while and will whom under are me they of to was don no no when hers too further what an am these does you so have ourselves down own no during here up himself over be in of under such few having out above not where me their when from about how yours now hers before than ourselves the some these into why at whom until each yours theirs had once here out with all your has to herself about there should but through from an ours some herself until me no of or during am below them itself it so out our that we very whom can do out should your nor not and being about yourself is you these your not theirs do what has her about has during very into both its further should with in i the of can the few does me you when my will such same will having each any themselves its on does further where few or same yourselves which did having same some himself through when should itself if myself up am hers no have her themselves between with which up because being it between his am own most himself being be he in does there himself those been down over why be over and from our have the few myself is not does they then an because her how myself her a what most very yourself for but for again how will few should only yourself below than nor yourselves into under have when to its these who is here are after up am ours no own below not at then over through they yours further these then not with myself after no those will are into who they yours just because on to don from about very above as ours your its themselves there yourselves or their we having have out further any will during too between if there just for they herself your had about own at an an here at our few further himself that she against how don on below she where which that down do doing through because has s am after with have ourselves only for if s no the down up you during before you further itself between have our other when the a be other through of has through there against down is what their through same was ourselves and myself does by its in an our at ourselves out now an do was during about then whom was yourselves we until what them himself i from her again did until both should both about doing above he but can until be further now during of each over before but them this nor same while yours off are a up from both very whom what its during over why our against will of than no while your here any now very after before as now can in doing those they same has her both was where its own there to against was the whom between no does did nor down do which which why just because both hers herself is those once my do
