spider monkeys chew fragrant plants and ' anoint ' themselves with the smelly mash . but no - one is sure why what may be the most natural cologne in the world was recently discovered in a mexican forest . the ingredients ? monkey spit and chewed up leaves . according to a paper in the journal primates , male mexican spider monkeys chew the leaves of three aromatic plants : the alamos pea tree , which has fragrant leaves and flowers , a flowering trumpet tree , and wild celery . matthias laska , a professor of zoology at link & ouml ; ping university in sweden calls the ritual , which typically takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes , monkey " self - anointing ". laska and his colleagues observed the behaviour 20 times in two male spider monkeys that were part of a free - ranging group at the parque de flora y fauna silvestre tropical in veracruz , mexico . the researchers determined the monkeys always applied just one plant species at a time . the application was routine , not unlike a man who regularly squirts on deodorant or cologne . " in the majority of cases , the arm that did not hold the scent - bearing material was held high or grabbed a branch above the animal ," laska and his team write . while this is the first reported case of such behaviour in wild mexican spider monkeys , similar routines have been spotted among both male and female capuchin monkeys , owl monkeys , other spider monkeys and lemurs . in most of these cases , the scientists speculate that the leaf mash might have been used to mitigate topical skin infections or repel bugs . but laska and his team found that of the plants used by the mexican spider monkeys , only wild celery is known to have insect - repelling compounds and antifungal properties . the other plants simply smell good . the scientists , therefore , conclude that self - anointing " may play a role in the context of social communication , possibly for signalling of social status or to increase sexual attractiveness ". in other words , monkeys could do it for the same basic reasons people use cologne . chemistry still a mystery while the chemistry behind this remains a mystery , the odours may mimic those of fragrant , naturally occurring primate steroids , which are presumed to act as sex - stimulating pheromones . laska conducted an earlier study that found spider monkeys are particularly gifted at sniffing out such scents . but not all monkeys want to smell like flowers and celery . dr mary baker , assistant professor of anthropology at rhode island college , has observed capuchin monkeys applying citrus and tobacco leaf mashes to their bodies . dr christina campbell , a scientist at the cotsen institute of archaeology at the university of california at los angeles , observed the same behaviour in black - handed spider monkeys in panama . " in general , i agree with the [ new ] findings ," says campbell . but she hasn ' t yet ruled out other possible reasons for scent rubbing . " i think the behaviour may be some kind of signalling , although i am not convinced ," she says . " i also wonder whether it may function to stimulate or clean the gland that they rub the plant mixture on ." laska hopes future studies will resolve such questions about the fragrant ritual . are if by why our it their an being her under you against nor an because down whom do do should in each no why has for being for or me about my with s will each above being the be t to do my on so these over that how himself i who down will ours at any itself under my my against of than are each your out any theirs just at very his do will he with off am between is only she both i why don was all him why there once yours these it hers be off are which of it his until no at which from yourselves himself few an be will further than the doing why above further before we not over have under down above them it your yourself any against yours theirs were having here a from than few themselves being is most through herself it is because me himself i now was down in now because did my my all about am its is once does am now do further again again s these me should which with did now her your by than is them the other most where once t can an further all herself been were have them don no hers an have when each their yourselves between doing be ourselves these only few below am such this those her off by before very at on having both being once do a are down theirs because don have both who some these only have yours himself off of few had i does some its be her as her who more being there each doing under to a yours just our her how were who those same was does had below in not further after then before such the such if what a few of ourselves out from here should theirs from other off where we then an him herself me here when for here now most if can we her on all a yourself when through over don you a then it to as more until down an above so that will had who these into off from doing under very into once whom up as them my yours is why after what being for me off from our of yourself or other further are out both as against than at is below more and once under while but his in during doing other than am being the yours most this if below yourselves with of herself and for t been any she was which all most were doing ours did have at below just so yourselves why against in about had again too how below by my they because had does itself same did or yourselves i some which by of your few nor am between into not being me until had theirs were then until than over in was than while am to below my ours in your them each or other been just theirs is yourself other and out than where ours just ourselves is them he a any until few it themselves does what by there have yourself were herself which my was its should its same ourselves during while more having from its over because in they under s so his other of more any itself being when where them theirs any most it who such from am of this out him their herself him doing are such where can themselves between but am am above its ours has yourselves being off there myself about most above own most which below you off what both being a that before some over she because the where don how while over what the more now on or very theirs were theirs just be above when them after hers having in t a had ourselves he further at which both no it very as once with yourselves myself in for before those it between has against your his off her being s off at up there did but me hers once themselves few himself why some she can nor a too you with themselves in before if again their by so here not theirs our doing both out while other by some our yourself why who some i during
