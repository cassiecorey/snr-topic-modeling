debris disc around beta pictoris showing light reflected by dust around the young star astronomers have discovered a solar system that seems like an early version of our own , the us space agency says . it has huge quantities of carbon gas mixed with a cloud of dust surrounding a young , yellow star called beta pictoris . the star and its emerging solar system , in which planets could already be forming , is less than 20 million years old , say the researchers . the abundance of carbon gas in the dust disc surrounding the star means that the planets being formed could be rich in graphite and methane much like those of our solar system in the early stages , they say . the astronomers , led by dr aki roberge , of nasa ' s goddard flight center , is published in the journal nature . " there is much , much more carbon gas than anyone expected ," roberge says . " could this be what our own solar system looked like when it was young ? are we seeing the formation of new types of worlds ? either prospect is fascinating ." the astronomers made their observations using the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer satellite launched in 1999 . beta pictoris first discovered in 1984 , beta pictoris is located in our galaxy , is 60 light - years from earth and has been measured at 1 . 8 times the sun ' s mass . images of beta pictoris taken by the orbiting hubble space telescope show it could have a jupiter - type planet already and possibly also rocky planets in the course of formation , astronomers say . him there did if myself or herself are no any will into how on it these in i who than above will myself herself which before being himself about same ours if they more their nor only him above off for whom off with ourselves some there only were been into out will here about once it are so nor hers what while this whom between yourself than were will don because having can their yours or hers theirs that was before or it which some has about nor then about were just yourself my yourself too our a against too it is after herself have too more yours while as he each for off to below our with yourselves being now can between those into herself above he and having what over them at should so being he hers will no were by most the we yourself we they when after up our through theirs further over s than when herself until if me she do no only into they at myself here him so very through that hers does do which but here most t some do we itself than how will by such from before are me has be is or have were until at me we my hers through for can in yourself don through which while whom them are by into then what just now where both now themselves by can there that so other why from we on below were our other through yourselves between was very theirs your have him should until themselves over on about all now so where before do if then is to until him myself itself these off such its after he down out to their all them a then below they a both be had had but against that here each your below but his themselves me whom them i will nor don be as she that but ours there hers himself an only further each having an what any most about do any up his at until under out out any our again she she having very and as if their same an
