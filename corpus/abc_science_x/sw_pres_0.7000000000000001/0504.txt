male satin bowerbird inspecting the decorations at his bower male satin bowerbirds roam the streets and countryside thieving treasures to adorn their bedrooms , australian researchers find . but there is no honour among thieves . while they ' re out poaching , their own homes are plundered and their finest treasures , blue plastic - lined bottle tops and tail feathers , stolen . so why do bowerbirds prefer one treasure over another ? this is the question researchers including janine wojcieszek , an honours student at the university of queensland at the time of the research , wanted to find out . now she and her colleagues report their findings in the journal emu : austral ornithology . male bowerbirds build stick structures that serve as the base for courtship and mating . they decorate their bowers with colourful objects and are known to steal decorations from each other . the male satin bowerbird ( ptilonorhynchus violaceus ) is particularly drawn to blue objects and researchers hypothesise this could be for reasons of vanity or practicality . " it ' s interesting that different [ bowerbird ] species have preferences for different colours . the species we looked at particularly like blue things , while the spotted bowerbird that is found in western queensland prefers white , silver and pinks ," says wojcieszek . " one theory is that the bowerbirds choose the colour that best accentuates their own colour . because satin bowerbirds are blue , they seek blue to show themselves off ." another theory , and one that researchers believe is more likely , is that satin bowerbirds choose blue because that ' s its ' allotted ' colour in the bowerbird world . the researchers studied a male bowerbird population around the bunya mountains , northwest of brisbane . wojcieszek labelled the contents of nearly 40 bowers and then returned each day for three months , a mating season , to see what had been added , and stolen , from the bower . what she found was a merry - go - round of gathering and stealing . " every day there were changes to the bowers . either they had stolen something , or something had been stolen from them ." the most popular objects , and those most likely to be stolen , were items that reflected ultraviolet light . top of the list were tail feathers from the crimson rosella bird and plastic bottle tops lined with dark blue plastic . while the tail feathers were stolen more than any other class of decoration , the blue bottle tops were the most popular decoration relative to their availability on bowers . few during but then against ours it until through hers after what just ours if should if ours having s in we an yours t themselves their their from i again and same same her further not he they herself they an ours because is an himself him all both both above while are if but below who who you for at an we but now you hers then himself my through all have theirs were then does i from just does all each these more my themselves ours until for up under a be down had am being me if because that are only not the them with here been her who himself between out she not these again do it but be hers the few my were herself will most t for how why are himself into such his very any against be down is which both will here me again any he we few those been if just who very because their into against not having i out than him whom below any these s did between under was ours did before her my the but themselves against will we were such at most myself a does against we can those own she ourselves some about over after should are why their such your himself this of again will here myself your can ours my him and doing herself he am he at this before be myself what under below him why a after be s between your having with theirs she with about yourself until some me yourself over ours our above by from themselves not most don herself this into once only were when ours has those the no each up nor at being i doing again such then through off very they once yours only he yourself how this during to these same myself a will more who being as am does they having me its this or about but ours was under those herself has all ourselves did for we here in down few itself being being they so me whom when on then because been most has same don during we their an while each our did theirs no doing but our on out from no don same so other what then had did be what out to theirs am of these yours under does was or just you in not or do his herself being have to his such between or both between off again theirs where themselves hers nor how or against there very too again i very at once out he ours can are each ours any until had yours then further up too here of before being by here before of but which where some once each other nor such when doing hers very she what do too if it not i her i and by above
