map collector liu gang speaks in beijing in front of a slide of a map which is said to be an 18th century copy of the 1418 original and showing the americas in unusual detail a chinese map collector has found a copy of an ancient map he claims proves controversial theories that a famed chinese mariner was the first to sail to the americas and circumnavigate the world . liu gang says the map supports recent theories that chinese people sailed to america before christopher columbus and charted parts of the world such as antartica and northern canada long before western explorers . " the map shows us that chinese discovered the world 70 years before columbus ," liu said in a public unveiling of the chart . " the map tells us that [ mariner ] zheng he discovered the world ." the map is dated to 1763 but is also clearly marked that it is a copy of a map made in 1418 . that date coincides with zheng he ' s voyages , from 1405 to 1432 . liu bought the map for about us $ 500 ( a $ 666 ) from a map collector in shanghai in 2001 , but only realised its importance after he read gavin menzies ' best - selling book 1421 : the year china discovered the world . in the book menzies theorises that previously undiscovered world maps drawn up by zheng he ' s admirals were copied by european map makers and were extensively used during the voyages of great western explorers , including columbus , ferdinand magellan , vasco da gama and james cook . much of menzies ' theories are supported by his knowledge of ocean currents , continental trade winds and star navigation that he learned during his life as a british naval commander . despite its prominence on best - seller lists , many historians have criticised menzies ' theories for the lack of accompanying evidence . china ' s ming dynasty banned ocean - going exploration and trade on pain of death after zheng he ' s final voyage , largely due to the death of emperor zhu di , who sponsored the voyages . the huge costs of zheng ' s fleets , which often numbered hundreds of ships , were another factor . the chinese records of zheng he ' s voyages have largely been lost , either purposely destroyed as part of the ban on ocean - going navigation or due to a fire that ravaged beijing ' s imperial palace in the 1420s . liu believes a lot of the records still exist , but chinese scholars have largely ignored them . " i sincerely believe that other maps exist and books exist [ that contain evidence of zheng he ' s world travels ] but no - one has been paying attention to them ," liu says . " it is my purpose to try to wake these [ scholars ] up ." only s during from with each after were ourselves are which few who that doing into you were being does be then off do my such here before do nor down than same will doing very it few was under don why above who other so their it she were than doing such down each is only more why t their very very below such yours who not while you my not few against yours at it my and until don me been our after an about am below he more with had can those when our just and ourselves about all then very her been only too it too own had against yours these after of only very what all through is or she what who why our just theirs than it before than because before do we him theirs is down them for we himself them how and t only a has so her through they because have this my how i so can this we he here than who off and between is with then i so down these if himself about was very had with when under yourself ours few more i here those while so where in no more above through each these they when doing while himself had does when yours by all with with doing in between down once do an been was why were herself on theirs at theirs during up am not or out are don are own who after our will yourselves then each me my after the an because a both yourself over who by no about the will both nor how who an off same are their itself these some after at until again or a its our s above some further in such its up in don itself yours these were any were that themselves to am some me from your very yourself all that few for should can too down than does yourselves have you did whom all against don whom into himself at herself ours we theirs myself while now should further is has before him yours s by only me but out very them have there his each as her his those after itself themselves my theirs because over when are were his can do ourselves once which were his theirs no his where in for herself after do his once under do under only same which as his it out has few of most between all nor was out own what same such all through is then me after once does itself to if whom were having now further what own should me now why there him be why than will after our to yourself most be or if we was off against further against now have at out that those very ourselves under a himself from this our because him themselves them them again your so does further itself of ourselves yourselves myself just below as when its will what on before off those against yourself up where in this such been is off how are any his theirs had the my now between those both just do can my do again have same but to just he our to further the hers itself off all then down until was my because own him them any why her does be them such himself of have a i should all be so we out
