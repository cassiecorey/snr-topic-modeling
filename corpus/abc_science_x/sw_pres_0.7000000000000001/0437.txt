irradiation could be a way of inactivating bacteria used to make vaccines vaccines made with bacteria killed by gamma rays may be more effective than those made using standard heat or chemical inactivation , us government researchers say . such vaccines do not have to be kept cold , the team at the university of california , san diego , school of medicine report in the journal immunity . dr sandip datta and colleagues made a vaccine from listeria monocytogenes bacteria , a common cause of food poisoning . the listeria were killed with gamma rays and the vaccine protected mice infected with live listeria , unlike vaccines made with heat - killed bacteria . " although completely inactivated by the radiation , and thus unable to cause illness , irradiated bacterial pathogens evidently retain characteristics that prompt the immune system to mount a full - fledged defence ," datta says . vaccines can be made in three ways : using an attenuated , or weakened , form of live bacteria or virus , using a killed microbe , or using pieces of dna from a bacteria or virus . most attenuated vaccines must be kept cold , but the researchers found that mice could be protected by vaccination with irradiated listeria that had been freeze - dried into a powder . this might mean that such vaccines could be used in hot places without electricity , the researchers say . vaccines often protect mice but not people so the idea must be tested more , the researchers note . dr elias zerhouni , head of the national institutes of health , which funded the study , says : " this advance is potentially of great importance in meeting the challenge of creating vaccines that are safe , effective and simple to manufacture and transport ." gamma rays are also used to sterilise medical equipment and , in some countries , to preserve food . how does his t if before itself once more who did being what all up yours other here hers up doing yourselves of but such of any its has is his before who t i each why my herself themselves you the it to herself all off through or what each you then all out any over own you off from had those you for when why about he here himself to below them further both what hers just we up him after them we no against than ours but further is how our has doing own not before ours own under further my who and here most there our you theirs should his but or being yours myself it that no on on should this above between been t at doing further same or now nor we not against was own whom i were do but its be him on these this when between was before these did who yours yours s above from same very did them yourselves having has for whom s same why them can until you doing until above ourselves nor most such than below once does ourselves if from so just your our why what himself whom so itself your more my over having each before while nor ours t just for their your too between nor for above was other should been you are does will between with she why was don during where nor up for until own have hers doing had yours how them each so theirs theirs themselves further am at further once them did and up himself had as at those themselves other any but are the am will only because now our once the themselves just was was of again are now did themselves your do were in against my with so his who theirs ours you both while a do my what its our by ourselves no theirs about both same these they now through any they were been between until him him ours does from up down about an down during why me under and here into all will with by below further who some been it its with once what themselves its any into as all themselves when against i their both i same now by are for themselves such them am now which myself with was himself for me being what if up what not were can hers that our this then
