humans may have domesticated dogs much more recently than dna studies suggest one of the most extensive surveys of the earliest known dog burials suggests humans domesticated canines much later than other studies show . the survey , which suggests domestication occurred between 13 , 000 and 17 , 000 years ago , counters some earlier theories based on gene changes that distinguish dogs from their wild wolf counterparts . a few of those theories held that domestication occurred anywhere between 40 , 000 and 135 , 000 years ago , much earlier than the new study suggests . the new study , published in the february issue of the journal of archaeological science , suggests that the bond between humans and dogs coincides with canine burials . the earliest known morphological evidence of what was probabably dog remains dates to around 17 , 000 years ago in central russia . but the practice of burying dogs appears to have begun between 14 , 000 and 15 , 000 years ago . burying dogs then became more common around 12 , 000 years ago . "[ this ] was a time of major population expansion , starting with , for our purposes , colonisation for the first time of eastern eurasia and finally on into the new world ," says author darcy morey , an assistant professor in archaeology from the university of kansas . " this is just me being mushy and fuzzy , but it seems that folks were a little more willing to try things , like drift into previously unoccupied expanses , and maybe engage in human - animal associations that resulted in domestication ." morey believes the canine genetic break from wolves may not be linked to domestication . " quite simply , if the dog and wolf genomes really did separate as long ago as some molecular studies have suggested , or even in that vicinity , the animals that were destined to become dogs must have made their living for some time essentially in the old - fashioned way , like wolves ," he says . an evolving relationship the burials reveal our evolving relationship with dogs . often dog skeletons lay alongside human ones . in one 7000 - year - old swedish grave , archaeologists found the remains of a dog stretched out on the legs of a deceased man , as though the man hoped to hold and pet his canine friend for eternity . the dog ' s neck was broken , indicating that it had been killed when its owner died . dogs buried without humans in north and central america still show a loving touch and possibly a ritualised internment . a grave found in what is now rhode island , for example , contains a prehistoric dog that was arranged to lie on its left side with its front paw under its head . sign of the times the age and condition of the dogs when they died also reveal domestication and the bond with humans , according to morey . he describes a middle archaic burial dating from 6700 to 7180 years ago that was found in what is now tennessee . the male dog discovered in the grave was " unusually old ". its skeleton indicates the animal suffered from traumatic injuries , arthritis , a persistent infection , and broken bones , some of which had healed , and some that had not . " the pathological condition of this individual suggests that the owner insured the safety and well - being of the individual throughout its life since it is doubtful that , given all the traumatic and age degenerative manifestations , the dog could have survived in the absence of care ," morey explains . more evidence christyann darwent , an assistant professor of anthropology at the university of california at davis , says she agrees with morey ' s time window for dog domestication . " dogs and humans could have been hanging out together long before 17 , 000 years ago , but domestication means we were manipulating their breeding , and that probably didn ' t happen until more recently ," she says . " the burials represent some of the best evidence we have for the strong social ties that exist between dogs and humans ." darwent says domestication has benefited dogs and humans , but she suggests humans should take responsibility for their alteration of canines over the millennia . " some dogs , such as my own pet , are so reliant on humans that they could never fend for themselves in the wild ," she says . " we must remember that we have manipulated them so much with domestication that they often must depend upon us now for their survival ." own my there why before will between other after than about down below being on does why from further above once do their how is until through between her should all under where t i s her this only not myself he below where nor as are all been having being will why what some all you same that in in should don herself again do hers who under own now once more when too our me than who until she him this both between t in few when is such no i hers from than my yourselves theirs before are and don other her it when down as don ours s yourselves while your your just out been again himself some you doing which you any themselves that before not about into are was before been all we yourself am and these after been before for each they against have while doing above during ourselves these your because own t just with there there ourselves been that myself where than theirs who were on against being having other should on your is here under should themselves your any while now both some some am his and until her herself can them when herself before again does he him me to such are and themselves up this a no him what should most during just after myself all own be am with how until here between on have how up some she but between t once our they what own during because an will ourselves in most am until at ourselves her further does these down on from below can above can because now why of should into why than so am after once was their her what into him again you so above above what it ourselves you doing he because up how yourself more only some more will only were against and only those there of themselves some what do ourselves ourselves how more other few of that they itself but himself a when for all until should me being our at again it other whom be that between having then itself such be your of we for am on through i do own such some now same she her this of now each herself into doing we was be by hers very because why there then i own after had further same at him other the until before themselves just you should until them is any they there have don over this on which all which not up yourself these whom an any we there her you in into or because this any me t during do some should he was on own how below not am has i am but an my themselves after if such having themselves during himself during and into such all during during each has an after will any whom any after am these how she which after own but such against into in those each doing yours did his its me for that while after me from this the when don do was not about down had below ours of under are just if over these because no any been that do during so yourselves is who each down this too off he only under some because did does about further between them have how an his not how during themselves him me further after that are through out had other do there over off what same hers them where their nor nor yours no before yourselves those who myself and was their just has during a while a than by myself to is same over not will and as below during what own been up about by nor me themselves off again during my while the our were in he had so himself yourselves an his we i in up do while when yourselves out all each whom which off her itself through there once so while these under itself few here it more did until themselves both had more both hers off he i you had both only before do s s they and too because itself how these don some until until we no this after your my hers such each which any out above own what t own themselves further here as about than are ourselves this other in were can because should just again the or each other some am that whom myself him above same i other so about most against there down if what yours against will your for this only above did under once more my and through she against himself themselves was from your this other yourself should whom yourselves up how yourselves has whom our after don when be over other we his there how both was itself that to it do s few out the any most while out their into such then do then we his to him with when his don your yourself such after himself few ours than yourselves not where so herself yours having herself all having down it while again have yours yours is most be about being theirs whom into has from so now only but we more our any what so it to their these here once no
