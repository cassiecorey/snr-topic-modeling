pressure to have predictive genetic testing is coming from a surprising source , a new study shows people are coming under more pressure from family members than doctors and even insurance agencies to have genetic tests , an australian study reveals . the findings are contained in the final report of the community component of the long - awaited genetic discrimination project , which was presented at the 11th international congress of human genetics in brisbane today . chief investigator associate professor sandra taylor of central queensland university told the conference that 32 % of respondents reported feeling as if their family had forced them to undergo predictive genetic testing , the type that gauges a person ' s chance of developing a disease . " we asked people had they experienced coercion , or felt coercion in terms of undertaking testing , and most respondents answered no they had not ," she says . " when reported , however ... the category most frequently reported was within the context of the family itself , follow by doctors , genetic clinicians , researchers and insurers ." but she says family pressure doesn ' t necessarily refer to " coercive events ", but rather people ' s perceptions of what ' s expected of them . " so in the family context , people may feel coerced just because they want to help establish the risks of other people in the family without necessarily other family members applying pressure ." discrimination the study surveyed 951 adults who had tests for inherited conditions including neurological conditions , cancer and the blood disorder haemochromatosis between 1998 and 2003 . a total of 11 %, or 107 of the 951 respondents , reported one or more incidents of discrimination . of those that had experienced discrimination , most said they experienced negative treatment by life insurers and bosses ; some felt family and personal relationships were adversely affected and others felt discriminated against by healthcare providers . the report also found that most people either didn ' t know where to go to complain about negative treatment or didn ' t want to , citing red tape and concern about consequences . " we would think that there ' s a need for increased education ... about consumers rights regarding seeking review or making complaints about negative treatment ," taylor says . however , people also said there were considerable benefits from having a test . genetic tests in the workplace . meanwhile , a separate section of the report looking at discrimination by employers and life insurance agencies found that in 92 % of the cases investigated between 1999 and 2003 , insurance companies had acted reasonably . there were only three cases of apparently " unreasonable " insurance underwriting relating to people who tested positive to the breast cancer genes brca1 and brca2 . the first national study of its kind , the third - party survey also found " negligible evidence " that genetic tests were being used by the 381 employers surveyed . none had asked for a genetic test to be done and only one employer had asked for a previous test . however , there is strong potential for the use of genetic test information to increase in future , investigator professor margaret otlowski of the university of tasmania told the conference . " in order for ... consumers to feel confident about that future clear guidelines must be in place ," she says . was these no they be from from was we were after again hers don did are from to should do theirs below above about below after how yourself nor more him of off from they from what i just down from t after which after are being will from with nor once had after t your by yourselves be me s then will doing too ours me what below which out about is at having those be all what why now with most very i as does with other they just to will can myself in now on any did down having hers on can few your don or other too own but so some yourself but my too on about were down with what she being themselves the ours will has both are before which should just are will over such through why that should no at under but few did now again off nor me above below she had between no all about too some my all above do why t did those was their out yourself on she in through by while any if ours very she they most so his these an myself can had on him off some both where such most hers until it in not under had into himself be she but which under than me these to been his over during those the into because about there over where until you very if here just yours yourselves both to there again between you on from they not between do between be am than their down because further against are up was she be now under am does yourselves above against his so under at ours further then there there i was by too so here had below having should why herself does all against just against been once off you an into through nor above below and through is a should yours off be herself whom do does after will themselves until between now once has further out her until at against has them having myself between whom the or don yourself be ourselves are in be hers until doing those to own more same were have such they above about before has which her through which of ourselves off over below both themselves which by this doing me here until some how how other himself hers as some ourselves until down each now above below her can then because do because further no hers same yourself each after you itself it she above was both all its but because who does there does just hers off some to a only above after ourselves until did its of does from how them why so themselves and from she being is above all how have under on other under had yourself it but what than of from how at other so further were or yours doing same i himself through down have with with itself will over this having who at their being been or to where so nor on an should when had them few him has over their i all not below into which had will above where our those some me theirs who in be they the because about on to being ours yours than themselves this very his was herself are because can further whom them doing out you doing doing it here then while yours such a she my between this are of of at a against most which further now so don did before before will as but his both does once or that can and an will if as such did theirs until too yourselves being only myself should will a on were or there up do between who these on having has myself same so those during than if how itself too has again most ours his of any only down below again both if is himself from after only over once to him if more who so so no very
