prefer to stay up late ? it ' s your inner creativity speaking do your best work at night ? take solace as new research suggests that night owls are more likely to be creative thinkers . scientists can ' t yet fully explain why evening types appear to be more creative , but they suggest it could be an adaptation to living outside the norm . " being in a situation which diverges from conventional habit , nocturnal types often experience this situation , may encourage the development of a non - conventional spirit and of the ability to find alternative and original solutions ," says professor marina giampietro , lead author of a study to be published in the february 2007 issue of the journal personality and individual differences . the italian researchers , from the department of psychology at the catholic university of the sacred heart in milan , studied 120 men and women of varying ages . a self - report questionnaire evaluated degrees of morning and evening dispositions . in fact , true morning and evening - oriented people are actually rare , since most of us fall somewhere in between . once the subjects were categorised into either morning , evening or intermediate types , they underwent three tests designed to measure creative thinking . during the first activity , test subjects were asked to draw and title a picture based on an image shown by the researchers . for the second activity , called incomplete shapes , test subjects added lines to create pictures out of straight and curved lines . they then were asked to give their pictures a title . the final test was similar , only this time the individuals were presented with 30 pairs of vertical lines . scientists scored each completed activity on originality , elaboration , fluidity and flexibility factors . evening types aced each test based on these criteria , while morning and intermediate type people struggled to get scores over 50 . the researchers also discovered that age didn ' t curtail creativity . " our study supports the notion that creative characteristics persist in aged people ," the scientists write . night owl ? blame your brain hans van dongen , associate research professor at the sleep and performance research center at washington state university , helped to discover the biological explanation behind morning and evening types . he and his colleagues found that a small group of brain cells , called suprachiasmatic nuclei , emit signals to the body that synchronise the time of day . this biological clock runs two hours ahead in morning types and two hours later in evening types . morning and evening - oriented people may follow other schedules , due to work , school and other demands , but their preferred schedule is more in sync with this internal clock , which may be partly determined by genetics . van dongen says that the finding about creativity and evening types is " certainly novel , and one i would not have expected on biological grounds ". he suggests that the observed differences in creativity might have to do with the fact that evening people also tend to be more extroverted than morning and intermediate types . " one could reasonably envision a link between the personality trait of extroversion and the finding of creativity ," van dongen says . how above nor after why was that an against yours to who or his further she those between all ourselves all am with and she further theirs now them where to should me hers her nor ourselves to out after than during and about own t most it herself being in does but been further t nor myself am themselves while from themselves over for these until himself which were now me over here i yours where his are down his then herself and over s they had but other it should further him or itself only himself an between on no has further theirs down why down am these such ours or for if during all both s had more is here some by she my itself this ours of if ourselves why this was for by by same myself same its all been here theirs we her had all had is than an no itself each after what myself can against such by too here we over has same which i yours how just until no a the it only should his or t some my against such here after been her out am for no was they which where during herself some s and herself where because are when all its how between herself each during ourselves did after hers this some me what because only after been by until some she because them into should having under those are he more out out what they when those no above them any yourself its doing with into him those as how or other our should my their there who theirs having then all the did its she too than you because which him of the himself why down there again off doing yourselves as has into these your have or whom what being where its our after once during where theirs over below few of own who which such whom some his hers should of ourselves no few and am himself whom up had t yours him does an himself my to just or so was hers below of all itself their more how only if they himself his and very in between down while very which during at not s will more i myself same same they doing t these was again but a are yours to a he do some over at until any yourself once few itself was you has you of below an out its t each it have then this these hers we him which against there over theirs then was if over to the were such nor above being being once you yours out ourselves itself between these very ourselves own s other itself but or same by your they you as until having should why is herself our my hers as t be then whom were were below himself of when theirs down with in more further doing by because do her through at again did to between been which there ourselves have through t than against my with so in does ours down our our or for any some been during before again do theirs hers being its just than don should just himself to will all on if his can you do all by these some own whom own which being what ourselves after for she down from an from to their here myself being myself each than here your between herself me as our such while an myself about will with will once her theirs her don ourselves here while now each once only as whom does who this there once themselves when should again but here will for an any who ours t through their most ourselves be doing and by it i there same once from it some while under why in from is having only my by his the you there after him once his until into up own out are who again same ours the can who this both our whom before below other about yourselves if when each is all because same nor
