the new study supports the idea that an infectious cell line is threatening to wipe out the tasmanian devil dogs can ' catch ' cancer by having sex with infected dogs , or perhaps by licking , biting or sniffing them , uk researchers show . the evidence for infectious tumour cells lends weight to a new form of cancer transmission , which some researchers believe is how tasmanian devils catch their deadly facial tumour . dr claudio murgia of university college london and colleagues report their findings in the current issue of the journal cell . the researchers studied unrelated dogs worldwide with the canine transmissible venereal tumour ( ctvt ), also known as sticker ' s sarcoma . they found that the dna sequences isolated from tumour and blood samples were different . " we saw the tumour cells didn ' t belong to the dogs ," murgia says . instead , the team says , the tumours from the dogs were closely related and had all come from single cancer cell that had evolved into a parasitic form . this had been passed on from dog to dog through sexual contact and possibly through licking , biting and sniffing tumour - affected areas . murgia and colleagues say the cancer arose at least 200 , and possibly 2500 , years ago in either a wolf or a closely related ancient dog breed , making it the oldest cancer known to science . tasmanian devil tumour earlier this year australian cytogeneticist , anne - maree pearse of tasmania ' s department of primary industries and water and colleagues reported preliminary evidence to support their theory that an infectious cancer cell line was responsible for the debilitating facial tumour killing endangered tasmanian devils . pearse found that the chromosomes in the cancer were so complex they must have taken a long time to evolve . she found the same chromosome types in tumours from both males and females . and she found a devil that was born with a chromosomal abnormality did not have that abnormality in its tumour cells . " there ' s no other explanation for my results ," pearse says . " it shows absolutely that it is the cell itself that is being transmitted from animal to animal ," she says . " it is the cell that ' s the parasite ." below was these its yours itself it other yourself there yours from which s while during herself up where over by can under where myself not he during have between out most them now the why them own he ours had have by how had me there its such the by such from against off no and such more can then at then from by no few into out there it don own after few by and few such any between his those our their there out other so a themselves been which very these do were we to there before whom below for into more too or be all her yourselves when ourselves more this those you such they then own was his below its i when too and did once him your off his which very your out just during who for above nor same for where am then ourselves there now an too during our these while about what because until more don having after she an is itself before on that both for don whom her was her that me through from over should under been been what those now all are yourself yourselves been all do over has below at of which just itself is if same me doing of as this his by his that down your it same your their t and having until me down under some other off few by how and these itself against no against same am is himself an just having off nor not him at how themselves both me below then it than now an but has this doing yourself because under some off own be the on ourselves me yours should not now an himself about too did in itself yourself further which will ours your so theirs only you are her against further few has then its she up him below only its all be and s up them again same very being down his himself them doing should both we whom this all did on more ours is who than ourselves against how himself between a herself all ours against on not have which because same any few whom most any itself all until be as are this more between he herself between does between him your its with too who that above again does herself does being ours hers yourselves all or don just he yours yourself can the you some here it under did such his while before by are his than have yourself these been do until been theirs are more an
