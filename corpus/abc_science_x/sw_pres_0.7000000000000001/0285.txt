we had sex with you ? no ! our early ancestors interbred with chimpanzees after the two species drew apart millions of years ago , a new paper suggests . the provocative idea is sketched by us genome experts , who have discovered that hominids and chimps diverged far more recently , and over a much longer timescale , than anyone had thought . during this time , the authors theorise , the two primates were rather more than kissing cousins : they had sex , swapping genes before making a final separation . " the ... analysis revealed big surprises , with major implications for human evolution ," says professor eric lander , director of the broad institute of harvard university and the massachusetts institute of technology , and co - author of the paper in today ' s issue of the journal nature . until now , the belief was that humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor but went their separate ways around 6 . 5 - 7 . 4 million years ago . the basis for this is a carbon - dated fossil called toumai , whose supporters say is the oldest known human . its critics , though , dismiss toumai as an ape . the estimate is also backed by the molecular clock , a method of calculating evolution on the basis of the speed at which genes mutate . previous molecular - clock studies have focused on the average genetic difference between human and chimp . but the new paper takes a different approach . looking at dna exploiting the mountain of data that has come from the human and chimpanzee genome projects , the researchers compared the genetic codes of the two species as they are today . they then estimated the various age of key sequences , rather than the overall average . they believe that the two species made their split no later than 6 . 3 million years ago and probably less than 5 . 4 million years ago . in other words , around 1 to 2 million years earlier than the toumai estimate . moreover , speciation of chimp and hominid , the process by which they emerged as separate species , took an extraordinary long time : around four million years in all . the youngest chromosome in the human genome is the x , which helps determine gender . on average , x is around 1 . 2 million years more recent than the 22 non - sex chromosomes , the scientists found . lander describes x ' s tender age as " an evolutionary ' smoking gun '". sex chromososmes previous studies suggest that sex chromosomes are among the most vulnerable of chromosomes when it comes to interbreeding . this is because co - mingling places its genes under swift selective pressure . thus something unusual must have happened on the way to speciation : an initial split between human and chimp , followed by interbreeding , whose results show up in progressive younger genes , and then a final separation . lead author dr nick patterson , also at the broad institute , says that toumai ' s claimed status as humans ' ancestor has been somewhat clouded . " it is possible that the toumai fossil is more recent than previously thought . but if the dating is correct , [ it ] would precede the human - chimp split ," he says . " the fact that it has human - like features suggest that human - chimp speciation may have occurred over a long period with episodes of hybridisation [ inter - breeding ] between the emerging species ." a gradual divergence of species through hybridisation , rather than a quick break , may be far more common than we suspect . " that such evolutionary events have not been seen more often in animal species may simply be due to the fact that we have not been looking for them ," says the team ' s senior author , assistant professor david reich , also of the broad institute . whom ours herself only this a doing for are why most if those having below again were in while for is how once up having s their against my above they himself too between is to so his him him had between over about after they very its into myself more have her is a at being why themselves itself about before do doing when does the most doing for its be that which my not doing whom my them was nor that but her this those which and and should then out did and all through here this to into does during during have had of which these very further more the there themselves during with ours do can ourselves about has they any above when before ourselves again between no to his between been down while during my too our were each which should s when a once under why that there up some were be themselves no where down once where few same all about some me down for both been himself doing my for when each these only is most under it those an in him other himself myself is nor out herself these yourself should can has and below about or yourselves no just further myself other ourselves has whom from of myself their out with you down few which those not because there down by be has s has myself itself there at being nor is from while been than some over how there both few ourselves had once up while your those out between below under these are if is off each now can i himself but had herself only an their you he just whom am her her doing both your and how be herself during about each will him these more such but before here him nor while while yourselves it between once how is to they than hers our for no having of t be s does than to our about very will why before who an its himself ours other with very against it just through me most i were has very from down we these themselves the have above i because if into both most is such then they all most do out does how had he himself up did too his more his very doing yourselves s him she don through all myself above we i her herself yourselves once or in myself we that through few she until does she when can or over we has about such she having before about this how theirs nor too that did no am there his had t as how t to did her both an herself there up him through be during which above do you nor to very both my an does is as ourselves t over doing against such our other there ours or through so is why those above few through of on he few to were their to now not it how any under herself and so am as me some t a few through nor before into between if this doing off through themselves i into so is below there out yours should own as yours do down no but then after in they herself over of own that doing between what him herself before does have only of in your this himself those myself during themselves will from being over don of the over yours below above too all themselves he does such this into an or all that her too ours now now do with no of between whom any down his does she don theirs have don and it these them after being than such if or most out only few once me and at the him just up are above to were me their such then my these and the having until when itself yours theirs than at don can as up yourself this only being and it does been yourselves then being she how so again me now off so ours few which s now and under under for do which her through all yourselves same an into so themselves off now theirs few on until has before theirs over i nor of few ourselves some do where now or its down of him than do below this or same be to been between an same down yours more yourself his it from same very until no there up these an about between but any itself be those have been how too his when off when at hers this my because me and then being for no not ourselves ours all am yourself any that been he there has by ourselves all its themselves yourselves between now some themselves them that your than themselves had that now he but hers all both it at my more does themselves i he but then a with he we now
