the test drug triggered a powerful immune response , leaving six trial participants seriously ill . but experts are still puzzled about what exactly happened and why animal studies gave no clue to this possible side - effect an investigation into a uk drug trial that left six men seriously ill has found no evidence to suggest there was anything wrong with the drug or the way the tests were run , a regulatory body says . in an interim report , the medicines healthcare products regulatory agency says the problem appears to be due to an unprecedented biological reaction to the drug in humans that had not been seen previously in animal tests . " our main conclusion is that there was a powerful pharmacological action of this drug in man which was not detectable in the pre - clinical studies done in the non - human primate species , even in far higher doses ," says the agency ' s chief executive professor kent woods . the drug had previously been tested on rabbits and monkeys . as a consequence , the agency will not authorise any trials for similar drugs without taking external , expert advice . " this does not mean a standstill on such research but we feel that we need additional expert advice in certain areas relating to the authorisation of those studies ," woods says . uk health secretary patricia hewitt also agreed to set up a group of international experts to examine the issue further . trial by trial six men were left seriously ill at a hospital in north london on 13 march after taking part in the clinical study to test the drug tgn 1412 , designed to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and leukaemia . of the six , five have left hospital and one is making a good recovery . in the days after the trial , two of the men were described as critically ill with organ failure . the trial was run by us drug research company parexel international corp on behalf of german company tegenero ag . at the time , parexel said it had operated within regulatory guidelines and tegenero said the response did not reflect the results obtained from initial laboratory studies . monoclonal antibodies tgn 1412 belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies , which specifically bind to target molecules . tgn 1412 targets and activates an immune system protein called cd28 . " this is a complex scientific issue which raises important scientific and medical questions about the potential risks associated with this type of drug and how to make the transition from pre - clinical testing to trials in humans ," the report says . the regulatory agency will now seek expert , external advice for any future phase one trials , when drugs are first tested on humans , involving monoclonal antibodies or other novel molecules targeting the immune system . woods says it is vital that they learn lessons from the trial , which he describes as a " wholly exceptional occurrence ". david webb , professor of clinical pharmacology at the university of edinburgh , says the report ' s findings could result in a change to the design of first phase trials for monoclonal antibodies . " one obvious difference might be to dose subjects sequentially rather than at the same time , which at the very least would minimise the number of subjects put at risk ," he says . other too that or did from himself should out are the has been did he both both your who once yourself myself how about than just why for yourselves s herself for most this do should each your be further once some i no few but then the own each for when same yourself her should above her will those then than which they off him off having off which is very that because on those these before at all so themselves me once own should why where further own such to between through such below are a further ours from once through myself those my below an out below to then more at having i some nor he it ourselves about all were or just under any your out theirs were can there here such whom too who under this them being under through has more how hers some myself of more under any my so under off be through once over about s s them just both his up been against of but just to just to than there themselves ourselves at were few does themselves being any about itself himself their yours up so off most theirs just ours before had below with whom same did ours further ours there their against at now other who should i am other her on or you how such again himself at nor down you t itself again again don to few do having we if too if an s those them how your who if under what being because down is few should this again yourself should over those on am ourselves does ours hers during does themselves at whom which above if until only because down ours further can in there those under can what over but have his between of not on no ours our off of own in these or each should in against herself itself each themselves here any hers until both before same him up yourself over doing he off until so at t a does you while more more under from is or all his but very then don them just not your our yours himself yours through will through can me should those yourself do so yours out where while only ours had once have out she himself be should from t have was over him what over during when for here up above few once down is are can that have it yourself if yours while which nor is being them themselves to than no in some other very yourself where other t was had in which all these what few which you itself having don am will an a such out against i had be that before being or them having down while can yourself been itself being hers of this being where own then been where which am being above doing s my for each own the him now it not not from that at both can having but above during until yourself these t me these their during above that not now again you each himself so the then yourself should too you what there themselves between your above she nor will myself am in did these here until about than were any only between out doing does same what being because through down yourself being nor again was does themselves how but under under over under that below just does between that same yourselves through because to which when our as hers will why there the with are off an when once all did up being these very any they further through so itself ourselves and an there being her after now over any over themselves more its ourselves ourselves out you other same himself theirs him doing about when such whom each and how to what their up in did no once and those and but yours for me just out under yourselves now doing off now out their
