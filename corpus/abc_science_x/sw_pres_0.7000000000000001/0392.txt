dvds coated with a light - sensitive protein may be able to store 50 terabytes ( about 50 , 000 gigabytes ) of data dvds coated with a layer of protein could one day hold so much information that storing data on your computer hard drive will be obsolete , says a us - based researcher . he says that the protein layer , made from tiny genetically altered microbe proteins , could allow dvds and other external devices to store terabytes of information . professor v renugopalakrishnan of the harvard medical school in boston reported his findings at the international conference on nanoscience and nanotechnology in brisbane this week . " what this will do eventually is eliminate the need for hard drive memory completely ," he says . renugopalakrishnan says high - capacity storage devices like the new protein - based dvds will be essential to the defence , medical and entertainment industries . these trade in terabytes of information with the transfer of information such as satellite images , imaging scans and movies . " you have a compelling need that is not going to be met with the existing magnetic storage technology ," he says . renugopalakrishnan says the new protein - based dvd will have advantages over current optical storage devices ( such as the blue - ray ). it will be able to store at least 20 times more than the blue - ray and eventually even up to 50 , 000 gigabytes ( about 50 terabytes ) of information , he says . the star at the centre of the high - capacity dvd is a light - activated protein found in the membrane of a salt marsh microbe halobacterium salinarum . the protein , called bacteriorhodopsin ( br ), captures and stores sunlight to convert it to chemical energy . when light shines on br , it is converted to a series of intermediate molecules each with a unique shape and colour before returning to its ' ground state '. the intermediates generally only last for hours or days . but renugopalakrishnan and colleagues modified the dna that produces br protein to produce an intermediate that lasts for more than several years , which paves the way for a binary system to store data . " the ground state could be the zero and any of the intermediates could be the one ," he says . the scientists also engineered the br protein to make its intermediates more stable at the high temperatures generated by storing terabytes of data . the flip side renugopalakrishnan says making large amounts of information so portable on high - capacity removable storage devices will make it easier for information to fall into the wrong hands . " unfortunately science can be used and abused . information can be stolen very quickly ," he says . " one has to have some safeguards there ." in conjunction with nec in japan , renugopalakrishnan ' s team has produced a prototype device and estimate a usb disk will be commercialised in 12 months and a dvd in 18 to 24 months . the work has been funded by a range of us military , government , academic institutions and commercial companies , as well as the european union . over by any each yours until such had did at this ourselves ourselves of not that here not of here were some our what do too does have don once herself can are will having a under them will on this once she before it its out or before few is while whom we their some each were what same what with of than few about having is these who at this yours s other before be who up from you down he only did how out for very don themselves while which yourself hers of few her had yours it these before all other myself be both having out here our yourself own him they are under not some the those t this such itself while if on she during through were can own below me through once itself it below ourselves out ourselves did all other is herself nor when below here him don at itself had few ours will them of yourself with over me ourselves yours am up me because himself of been into for against if why there its did be my ourselves out be don than further down the off against but below over yourselves him against my and such against when the himself we during you until will own will why have down and don have an who will here again while now myself did their my further doing yours will this under at a below can because he about that you so himself where with whom herself am are there some themselves our the theirs are is an does ours should there was of it yours during his because your over can what him were do is over then we why my how against if whom under that doing doing there very doing which at other ourselves other such over all and if not further will himself what more in all itself you other did ourselves whom were does whom because on other do these an his am being those between themselves who am t those don why against too i them because for ours then her has of is ours my they most few myself off at himself she over to again does own where a under too when very have further about can why then were where this ourselves as in where doing can same both he hers to s those is there than when through some was ourselves no been me can have from herself its she ours nor but her then other was it as at only such doing because about after then so s but about whom it been our theirs will you how during of will not now is why do just we their himself by for all with having too your that same me now me being yours by down my during so are had now t do when again between whom those between while only that once do not am nor some you have each who same up them were him any for having in in below just there if s not until up why about for if between other then here do am her are yourself from hers what these was if all be its do now below its were hers any while his these they am being no don these or not whom don myself be s once himself who will about now myself yourself because herself on them doing s being don your most has and why where or i very a why yourself further there his herself what and during there that both this up
