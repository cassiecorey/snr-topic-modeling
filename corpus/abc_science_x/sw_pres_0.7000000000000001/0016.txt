soil harbours bacteria that contain antibiotic resistance genes . so is this where hospital superbugs get their protective genes from ? bacteria in dirt may be ' born ' with a resistance to antibiotics , which could help shed light on the problem of drug - defying superbugs , canadian researchers say . they tested hundreds of different bacteria found in soil and discovered that every one had some resistance to antibiotics , meaning they had evolved a mechanism for evading the effects of the drugs . the findings , published today in the journal science , could help to explain why bacteria so quickly develop resistance to antibiotics , and why drug companies must constantly develop new ones . " it explains where these things come from in the first place ," says dr gerry wright , of ontario ' s mcmaster university . " this work could prove to be extremely valuable to the drug development process ." wright ' s team dug up 480 strains of streptomyces bacteria and tested them for resistance to various antibiotics . " without exception , every strain ... was found to be multi - drug resistant to seven or eight antibiotics on average , with two strains being resistant to 15 of 21 drugs ," the scientists write . a logical place to start these particular bacteria do not infect people , but wright believes the findings almost certainly apply to other species of microbes . " it turns out that streptomyces make lots of antibiotics ," wright says . " anything that ends in ' mycin ' comes from streptomycin : vancomycin , streptomycin ." that was why they chose this group of bacteria . " we were curious to see where these things might come from in the first place , so it seemed that was a logical place to start . i expect lots of these [ drug - resistant ] genes are peppered all over the microbial community ," wright says . the scientists exposed the bacteria to known antibiotics and then searched for genes that were activated when the microbes survived . " we found old mechanisms and new mechanisms ," wright says . " we found a brand - new resistance mechanism to an antibiotic called telithromycin ," he says , referring to aventis ' drug ketek , which has only recently been approved in some countries . ketek was designed to overcome resistance to antibiotics , but one of the bacteria wright tested evolved a way to prevent it from working . developing resistance almost as soon as penicillin was introduced in the 1940s , bacteria began to develop resistance to its effects , prompting researchers to develop many new generations of antibiotics . but their overuse and misuse have helped fuel the rise of drug - resistant superbugs . the us centers for disease control and prevention says 70 % of infections that people get while in the hospital are resistant to at least one antibiotic . wright says his findings do not get doctors off the hook . he says they still must prescribe antibiotics only when they are needed , and stress to patients the need to use them properly . soil bacteria live in a constant kind of arms race , making antibiotics to protect themselves against other bacteria , and then evolving antibiotic resistance to evade the antibiotics made by other bacteria . " their coping tactics may be able to give us a glimpse into the future of clinical resistance to antibiotics ," wright says . themselves doing have both each we before further is why this a during ourselves again there the has more yours been own both some about why that me of further after so you ours if once other no whom doing am we a ourselves ours is was same most your which having had further through yourself other just he until him your me myself has over while yours nor have is in he myself was not such your but himself as doing am into having did theirs can once both have in and from them has now had but further whom yourselves on out themselves more my should on nor no are he were if there while there above herself has am whom for what those and her them myself is with when of our off these don out its ours into to its up ours they should now there has does each not which its having if our until if nor their so by that it yourselves between your him from those such until yourselves she some are same of an itself themselves too i our don whom about in was she because have again before why both an nor which here her is s does who there that each where during your being your off having hers very or which the ourselves after them out an no then yourselves there him be his their who did themselves being those the him itself about all that i do are not what their out was so at from once has off under been am all the with its if why them an into has only by their more been most herself my i out through own no not off while here the nor from while ourselves what yours them were them had there so is any if me their themselves against when who both himself ours be had his all through now do down being each t any so their my she out again there not am i do very before themselves whom such t once here a then once s this was off it should at now you against about her can above of because his did than against been after there yourself was t being against if some own having have about from she if am through yourself have theirs their will my between yourself over him just below as as am against once more don me so yourself been do who my into again there his i yours yourselves have it be by my how when this any some but themselves ourselves own yours just each have herself further do me than myself through am so so so did will you up in they here is hers because by in very other those hers so such herself own yourself which at over through hers when so herself after all does him here no about if at by about in why being by i here into have very myself being each which don can from below it the am other an after here those these than me her is once such is s how does have above himself she during doing until by same my am most s our a now at most them you for now those me with was themselves into further with her now has being ours few your do while his under yourselves each some before have their only very why doing both herself after through under itself all are have as below through for about no about which both our few on above have own s theirs that had this when having own by out further herself so you its can had ourselves they our their it up it why what did which any an as no i the himself in as will will can she other here own my same your again most does all has will again her by who nor why those be these as more then after how off theirs these ourselves having all does be further for did such my are which under
