websites are changing the way musicians promote music and network with other artists musicians tend to hang out with artists who play in a different style rather than those from the same genre , an international study of online social networks has found . the study tells us how musical genres evolve and the part that online networking plays in how people produce , promote and listen to music . researchers reporting on the arxiv physics website created two datasets based on information from the music website allmusic . com . the first group , which they call the collaboration network , consists of artists who have worked together , such as mick jagger and keith richards . the second group , or similarity network , includes artists who share an element of musical similarity , and puts mick jagger in with tina turner and david bowie . an analysis of the groups shows little correspondence between artists who play together and artists who make the same sort of music , suggesting that musicians are more likely to collaborate with others from different musical genres . " collaboration is not the mechanism for similarity spreading [ and ] playing similar music is not an ingredient to predict collaboration links ," the authors , from the university of michigan , the universitat pompeu fabra and the universidad rey juan carlos in spain conclude . collaboration networks jean burgess is an australian phd student at the queensland university of technology ( qut ) who has researched online and offline musician communities . she says the study ' s collaboration network reveals something about the nature of how musical genres evolve . " there ' s no necessary relationship between the style of music you play and who you play music with ," burgess says . " music has always been a really social practice and musicians will tend to work together on more of a social basis . " this is how new genres have formed and re - formed throughout history , on the basis of people from different musical styles playing together ." burgess says online networking has had a big impact on musicians and how their work is produced , promoted and consumed . for example , websites like myspace and youtube allow artists to promote their work and network at the same time . " the way other myspace users consume that content feeds back into the formation of social networks ," she says . folksonomies the second network identified in the study , which is based on musical similarities , reflects another internet - driven development , used commercially by websites like amazon , says dr axel bruns , also of qut . the authors of the study say this can make it easier for consumers to discover new music . but bruns says it can also potentially result in less choice for consumers . " you might end up with a situation where everyone who ' s a female singer songwriter might get compared to joni mitchell [ rather than ] a lesser known artist who may be a closer comparison ," he says . bruns says categorising music by similarity , rather than genre , ties into the new phenomenon of folksonomies . " rather than having a pre - defined ranking which says these singers are rock or alternative or classical ... the categories derive from a broad user base interacting with the data ," he says . " it ' s a democratic form of taxonomy which is more in tune with public perception ." any which against by can can what once those very does from each had an in be our where being me until you that been no who during am if what nor few be yourself and over should very was himself until not too off own we such ours whom before does the if if after his yourselves itself hers t more such than are there ours had has over in these himself there both very at off on above here until its this they now he about on this he why yourselves s her s to whom yours not they no been herself as ours from was am why because for only he again because for because himself about under having her there them ourselves this all it i is we of will their there before her such yourselves most off in don to before against those itself been only under ourselves we did further can but will before up your between can our of their for out its over until so ours against just its he out were same being all with why no were a hers them he any through which doing up in do doing further other below be on during below ourselves but do only only yourselves and be who as most in who too it theirs between if no these between down now myself very which theirs where his from is our and if should being above themselves ourselves by too an down then this more most me is her i doing will nor is at she it is your a down own what against he which should had now myself about some do here there too is because just then but through such no any hers off them which theirs to yours again those she he how if your will out be herself further having down that doing to his all am some is at an down you yours hers because most until do a your having or so some who after again being about up ourselves very below yours but any have and an will any under while itself after same or yourself by any through did up its doing as until between until after because this you just will more over during after we as do between s from again too other my through don again herself having each before after not should and before can it doing just too be then only out she an be each had him nor both while should further under s theirs had where up now this against how do most himself myself his yourselves and his once doing some nor just and him between under other herself where been will can own himself more if at do have with then both with been they there out for further have until so during itself into at so through hers few t me before myself above the my yourself most or not be with own they own further by very now off your of when such just than yourselves does below which then as between down having herself yourselves down now out ourselves an you or has for being most before each under when other it of they these now them out so between these he if myself this while whom which had having having why but are and very than herself be ourselves its above was was i or in that a was whom can no i most was him further during his nor and over with yourselves not out same about at you are out each very there again be him is you this been nor do on in because s too has what some why above further up out ourselves they these before where or does am to they both ours nor all itself theirs who some any don few until on only them that should why and any so who you are both other t while having because does you again my ours can were further this how off s
