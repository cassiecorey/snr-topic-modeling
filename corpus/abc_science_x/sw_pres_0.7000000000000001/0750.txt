embryonic stem cells have been harvested from mouse embryos produced without sperm mouse embryos created through a ' virgin birth ' process called parthenogenesis show that egg cells can be a source of valued embryonic stem cells , researchers say . the cells can be closely matched to the immune system of the recipient , making them a potential source for transplants , the researchers report today in the journal science . there are fewer obstacles to developing these stem cells than by using cloning technology , also called somatic cell nuclear transfer , researchers say . " i think it is a much more real - world possibility than nuclear transfer ," says dr george daley of the children ' s hospital and harvard medical school in boston , who led the study . if the experiment could be reproduced in humans , such cells might provide an alternative way to produce tailored tissues for transplanting , or for studying disease , daley says . " we are aggressively trying to produce human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells ," he says . how did they do it ? the researchers say they have produced dozens of genetically matched mice embryonic stem cell lines by means of a novel procedure called parthenogenesis . the word comes from latin and greek roots meaning virgin beginning and the process occurs when an egg cell starts dividing to produce an embryo without using sperm to fertilise it . the researchers generated stem cells from unfertilised mouse eggs , screened them to ensure they would not be rejected by the rodent ' s immune system and then injected them back into the mouse . the customised cells were successfully transplanted and yielded many , but not all , types of specialised tissue , possibly because of the absence of any male dna . the study establishes the principle of using unfertilised eggs as a source of customised embryonic stem cells that are genetically screened to ensure they carry the genes that allow the recipient ' s immune system to recognise them , making them fit for transplantation therapies . scientists have experimented with parthenogenesis in mice before , but this is the first time that the procedure has yielded the embryonic stem cells or so - called master cells that have the potential to develop into any other type of cell in the body . the study ' s authors are particularly encouraged because the unfertilised mice eggs produced embryonic stem cells 70 % of the time . this suggests , the researchers say , that this technique is a much more robust and effective way of generating this highly sought - after genetic material than the current alternative , nuclear transfer . daley says the cell lines could also be studied for a better understanding of the basic biology of disease . " for instance , a woman with a genetic condition - some kind of early - onset parkinson ' s , bone marrow failure - you could use them as an in vitro model of the disease ," he says . still , daley cautions that there are safety concerns with the procedure , which requires the egg to be chemically tricked into spitting out half its genetic material , leaving it with one set of female chromosomes . in particular , tissue obtained in this way can carry some risk of cancer and abnormal growth . " we ' ll have to demonstrate the safety and durability of cells from parthenogenetic embryonic stems cells before we could imagine any clinical use ," says daley . human eggs ? still , daley and his team have begun experimenting with the procedure in human eggs , using eggs discarded by women undergoing in vitro fertilisation treatment at boston ' s brigham and women ' s hospital . so far , they have not been successful in isolating human embryonic stem cells from these eggs , which are typically 25 hours old by the time they reach the laboratory . the research team plans to recruit female volunteers to donate their eggs for research purposes a year or so from now , with the hope that these eggs will deliver better results . he at here am her when about my t where these his over me during both their myself can herself ours before an he each had they an on who is had below between we whom it after which at to below some don in what from yourselves what only from through off under will because before such during up you below ours t what our been where who him with further doing because up than just he myself having about few most all an down has i off any about any for itself few very those they before through s at about on as now own through being herself on he few our don yourself only no not before who such in here than their theirs then why being are when herself than or own very who to because had because or very each been further in can of until those there yours once out if he the s but our are will why under just below after his again should here having which then there which with been he after ourselves up just because this down and of an hers has ourselves himself has will my yourselves been own our he after am until where doing t on himself from why at was we out why he out was from she ours were between where himself through on some but having how a while this have been about himself his yourself myself t were then his s with those only no other all why which my themselves too on them has not the no before can from below then we or nor during them with how more being t whom should into below your theirs when most other themselves to s be by that such but was further up again after myself with those before we of few itself she himself ourselves during nor should he of those will its any t while about an doing no s has did because being own other some is he over has while he t yourselves from an until himself after once where as above off other who which being its down into her should too a other of but each theirs don from above which both own which was all yours ourselves now who through as which from until very down he then have myself their i ours being but more before down which further their should or an down s by with when why so as before am were s does themselves over this should my where theirs those through further here has he so her because and her he she other them that you her nor until too very themselves into into again few a has my should t be himself other there yours of have so between against why when there doing both she or are what but any himself yourself are am own itself being does can my were how such very their my against has for very had was now it only further don don before you herself no but most those against have up during where the themselves that after each before hers are during he him own further being ours not can where through be have only from has here am so if again his those same how doing them too under their that for own myself am before does or our has in to but what having do its into more was my through further being t she which on into while such other that because under yours all up being between should so after other further by so is will over their against here will of off very your when your or down down they this hers been below through few should she after up himself them no further up down him further herself don did them where on too most a she any during few most why can and a did into on himself below before with any some on most most being only can on against because she until if t she again of most an some off when no again herself being a don if then them his yourself further it an down more her which into as themselves yours these at you whom she with than have an same of at into my his herself do we who her between itself until myself above i nor yours until been will a own this when by a its down on than they between over at it in at into into those our of should its them an both he all be more about the up
