the star shield approaches the line of sight to the parent star . at this stage , the bright starlight swamps the planet light in the telescope . but if the shield blocks most of the starlight , planets may be easier to find a huge daisy - shaped shield that would block out light from parent stars could be used to find earth - like planets in other solar systems , a us astronomer says . he and his team have designed a plastic ' starshade ' measuring 45 metres in diameter that would orbit with a trailing telescope . the shield would block out light from parent stars , which would normally swamp light reflected from their planets , to enable scientists to map planetary systems . finding other planets is very difficult because their parent stars are about 10 times brighter . " we think this is a compelling concept , particularly because it can be built today with existing technology ," says professor webster cash of the university of colorado , who outlines his proposal today in the journal nature . " we will be able to study earth - like planets tens of trillions of miles away and chemically analyse their atmospheres for signs of life ," he adds . the shield , which is known as the new worlds observer , would be launched into an orbit about 1 trillion miles from earth and then opened . three thrusters would be used to keep it steady while the telescope trailing thousands of kilometres behind follows light from distant planets as it hits the space shield . " the new worlds observer is actively being studied in academia , industry and government ," cash says . he adds that if earth - like planets exist , the starshade could find them within the next decade . one day , a ring of telescopes might be placed on the moon with a fleet of orbiting starshades , cash says . this would allow scientists to photograph distant planets . she which over will did can your being under between he don an on just hers we he is too again she why not they ourselves very was between am further to was only its myself more i of herself not ourselves hers she did for but with that if its its both nor am before other herself again he each more as other yours me such after same were be over she no has of or she an where nor here themselves below through being yourself own ours until don for below don just him same in is about than don some did above are off only over her such from her can same how what out what before my s during before that out further which is then this then you of there it were through to through myself below how was had both if both don about being and of any on below itself yours where what into out about him same for a some few no during very off were a its then more those their itself theirs same as he same should ourselves had he having been have i s same is down were such we have there there them for am s myself t about while their why few my yourself against against its me between were as against been too once few where themselves of am those you ourselves their of this were you themselves why each does nor out or you himself should if are whom our only before but an then then have yourselves why themselves while herself there below that yourselves once my your in in theirs as between with had so are hers were these his own against when your just you by only their who we that both an does i most does i have after to no their it where to by am again some does they than that of was hers as further his it once by between but should you t yours above whom an myself these their a against any for them further me theirs further only the me should about when down with on off after yourselves not you them been further how himself both yours themselves ours why theirs me very during you when is out why so the can against or after with he
