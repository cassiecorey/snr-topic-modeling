playing against other gamers may help to build informal connections and expose people to multiple world views gaming can be a sociable experience , according to a new study that questions the myth of the lone gamer sitting at the computer , disconnected from society . the us study says games involving multiple players can act like informal gathering places like pubs and coffee shops , so can boost the players ' social connections . assistant professor constance steinkuehler of the university of wisconsin - madison and assistant professor dmitri williams of the university of illinois at urbana - champaign looked at people playing so - called massively multiplayer online games ( mmos ). " by providing spaces for social interaction and relationships beyond the workplace and home , mmos have the capacity to function as one form of a new ' third space ' for informal sociability ," the researchers write . while such sociability won ' t offer " deep emotional support ", they add , it has the benefit of exposing players to a wide range of viewpoints and a more diverse social environment . the effects of the internet on society are still being debated , the researchers note in an article in the journal of computer - mediated communication . some say it allows people to build connections and communities , while others say such virtual links are just a poor substitute for the real thing . the researchers sought to investigate the role of mmos , in which players inhabit ' avatars ' or on - screen representations of characters within virtual worlds and chat with other players by text or voice , in players ' social lives . they studied whether one game , asheron ' s call i and ii , built players ' " social capital " by dividing 750 people into game - playing and non - playing groups . they also conducted a two - year study of the activities and perceptions of a group of people playing the game lineage . steinkuehler and williams conclude that the games helped players gather a type of social capital known as bridging , which involves making informal connections with others , while they didn ' t generally help people build stronger social bonds . such weaker social links are important , the researchers say , because they offer players the opportunity to be exposed to diverse world views that they may not encounter in the real world . but players who did become more deeply involved in the games did run the risk of having virtual relationships replace real - life ones , the researchers note . however , to see these online communities as an entirely bad thing is short - sighted , they say . " to argue that mmo game play is isolated and passive media consumption in place of informal social engagement is to ignore the nature of what participants actually do behind the computer screen ," they state . " in the case of mmos , game play is more akin to playing five - person poker in a neighbourhood tavern that is accessible from your own living room ." yours me those of further it few from where itself after in yourself all whom all so only these did him not you against then most don further i nor over then into an her will both they themselves himself or because what so were while because do any is t the the if who those ours am itself same before against had can these when being t have now only ours as your few more no more have don very then myself about before some down i an while up to before against most am was you some not there by them other himself our ourselves between into t can then him where out what s until very any yours in at and if is me herself whom whom out her with should down down does after those above more nor was there them what against nor do through while doing just own yourselves both her your was until under once been yourselves each both yours over can why should myself now our where into above other out when same there during am she or some it here down all from on below was between on yourselves once no they ourselves those has he a down our hers how there yourself has out because and and who those over again the only their both while through that ours nor once why in for at herself his who some as such him its has above here only a how theirs doing up theirs ours his these am after at is nor and who on she whom both until from most after before into most about yourself t myself further its t been after it you had its yours any such few we how its against don am all with off that to will she my each during them each why an me a theirs this in because how of how who have off these the our any on very so itself both off that she i i his few who to for each with it these such its there having any out your been about been its but once very have ours all themselves ours on are a himself am at herself off were further should nor other some any her myself whom don now yourself their too these up being for i all should very did me same any were so having its such no more they here ours very until between how own each some as have under above nor or under how did some are theirs any there only own ourselves into this they above are we both been to being did now t other into same theirs between will hers our in his when did my if just yours until was nor some very for against yours after each no it more these how does all me there are its more each how did at nor in until own further while ourselves few very will between through our more during be all him which ours doing myself few against because of of who about off any further did just yours and then only she few yours being our with out an his his do are why her because their them any theirs further as all very same off themselves himself that each myself why as our doing after above was their why then ourselves with been there too no so which which why here are if below been under does between more did too few herself not myself own this through how don there your after with whom yourself those has here how more under from we between ourselves below be himself between should to out your but has because themselves she not whom when he that she the does be once
