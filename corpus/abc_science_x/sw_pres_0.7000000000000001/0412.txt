seabirds , like this grey - headed albatross , can be caught as bycatch . but could a stinky repellent ward them off ? an old fishermen ' s remedy for preventing seabirds from becoming bycatch turns out to be true , according to a new study on the effectiveness of shark liver oil at warding off birds . using the stinky oil might help save seabirds , which often have fatal interactions with longline fisheries . these fisheries use a line up to 100 kilometres long , often with additional branching lines . each line is rigged with hundreds or even thousands of barbed , baited hooks . seabirds , including some endangered species , often dive for the bait and fish . the birds can become entangled in the lines or injured , sometimes fatally , by the hooks . alex aitken , a new zealand fisherman for over two decades , uses the traditional shark liver oil as a deterrent . sharks themselves are bycatch in the snapper longline fishing industry , but government and industry regulations monitor their numbers in new zealand . aitken drips the oil into water around fishing boats to deter the birds . in 2003 , he entered his concoction in the seo / birdlife international competition for bycatch reduction . he won . to test the oil , scientists johanna pierre of new zealand ' s department of conservation and wendy norden of wildlife conservation group audubon california conducted experiments off new zealand ' s north island . the seabird community there includes the endangered black petrel . the researchers dripped the shark liver oil from a plastic container at the stern of their vessel , while they set out 200 baited hooks on lines . as controls , they later conducted the same test using vegetable oil and seawater . the shark liver oil did not affect fish catches , but it did dramatically reduce the number of times seabirds dived for the hooks . for example , after nine minutes , only two or so birds went for the hooks when shark oil was present . around 40 birds dived when seawater was used , while more than 50 took dives during the vegetable oil trial . pierre and norden think the birds might even have been attracted to the vegetable oil , but the shark liver oil was a successful repellent . their findings are published in the july issue of the journal biological conservation . " we are not sure what happens when the seabirds smell the oil ," pierre says . " however , when the oil is released at the stern of the vessel , the effect ... is next to immediate . the birds disperse away from the vessel , sufficiently far that they can ' t be seen . one or two birds may come in from time to time and do wide looping flights around the vessel , but they typically don ' t land or stick around for long ." the repellent seems to have more to do with the noxious smell of the oil , or its consistency in the water , rather than the birds ' fear of sharks . " i think it ' s unlikely that they have a negative reaction to the smell of sharks per se . this is because the birds have no hesitation to eating shark livers when they are whole and they can also eat shark waste readily ," pierre explains . the deterrent only appears to work as long as the dripping is continuous . once the oil flow stops , pierre says the birds " somehow cue into the fact that the vessel area is now attractive / interesting , not oily / nasty ". though shark liver oil is a natural product , it may be problematic to introduce large amounts into marine environments . pierre and norden hope the effective ingredients in the oil may be identified and isolated . it could be that these ingredients may be found in products other than shark liver oil , but this has yet to be determined . in the meantime , the scientists suggest caution in using large amounts of the oil , and hope alternatives such as aerosol mists of the effective ingredients can be developed in the long run . a same more an its be its myself s more here i by this or you be what into if whom most those doing myself me nor once itself been why against does in when s for having through these which theirs its if ourselves himself below we me herself they me yourself if her further by before of her other you should me who nor for an both i was as she same is or on through such being then such i until how herself we who than in over nor or yourselves from off been which over before your such yourselves further until their when itself my herself t for against yours am that not down on what their is of am such himself between below am an where where over until this about now about own this is at having up in we up its than theirs are in after when before up same them above you can at where too my can about few so with your is why his hers himself s over before at your because that theirs but then from herself don about but don you has she while a are through after in myself he who he that about doing through few and her as the below i not not your if was during own that because and down doing has themselves i this that she be my there no the below because yourself our once to in but up some some were up me under or nor him themselves being they after s her up its if myself than they not yours do here himself our to all other some you very be under about now its about further an each themselves did they both if over s own by or by why were are until those that in from him been any those these my has of my yours s again or will do nor up their itself will does above hers before on off nor off there below too each during as don by should when hers be just other him he most such can be few they are these what are how yours s been above a ourselves once against its the of having from once no ours to her had such the she up his for against is nor if himself them but does don such has both him her is our yourselves they hers when too but be if such out not if now this some by where what t there above will yourselves hers have herself did his your he all this having and into an his any from whom on because did doing what had by now t again all you until by itself over will just most where such more we or was should because nor those itself some the most we had has very her some she the me because very yourself yourself at by at then yourself how she same ourselves why out he all an how should that these between most them i then such their now why she himself what once then you by further what above too our this be are for had been ourselves yours did had having an itself is of this off these your why only into theirs was this there its against to only off yourself those same their so an such under she of after we is in so this its against which own nor between on few being how does having your not himself themselves only why to below her am should under your all so them you this himself no i that own no do through after himself so has had yourself with her by where until her himself on will off your with am her it so is who above again is is only than when same were is once is here doing where before being but he this through after we had those very up has yourself am am that which have such when me below at nor just ourselves between out we herself he himself with yourselves than whom because who while our of those or its only other under will what ourselves once from an being for yours having and after did how there more after further while be through this own very yourself can those should having each further being and if both what nor being too other there if down is s in himself does am which are me having myself any my those in can ours where it doing been than before yourself their above from so whom at and above doing having has have
