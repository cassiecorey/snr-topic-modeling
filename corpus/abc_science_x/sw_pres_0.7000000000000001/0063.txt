disabling a memory molecule in the brain lifts depression in mice as effectively as using antidepressants , researchers say new fossils found in australia tell us that enormous snakes evolved from predatory lizards like goannas , scientists say . palaeontologist dr john scanlon describes the well - preserved 25 to 20 million - year old snake skulls from the riversleigh world heritage site , in today ' s issue of the journal nature . " there ' s been quite a bit of controversy about what sort of lizards snakes evolved from ," says scanlon , of the riversleigh fossils centre in mount isa . he says one idea is that snakes evolved from small burrowing insect - eating lizards that lost their legs and developed an elongated body . another idea is that snakes evolved from relatively large predatory lizards such as goannas . scanlon says he hopes the skulls , from a now extinct snake known as yurlunggur , will settle the debate on the evolution of snakes . the structure of the jaws and face prove that yurlunggur , an arnhem land aboriginal term for ' rainbow serpent ', is a very primitive snake , says scanlon . " it has so many features in common with lizards rather than other modern snakes ." for example , yurlunggur has a clear jugal bone , similar to a cheekbone , not present in modern snakes . and , in particular , the skulls show the snake is more closely related to large predatory lizards than to smaller insectivorous ones , says scanlon . " it basically shows a relationship between the most primitive snakes and the varanoid lizards such as goannas and mosasaurs ," he says , referring to the giant acquatic goannas that lived during the cretaceous period . they you hers as are because have until as below we after my being our themselves the when why itself being my where a me them now so than themselves my doing until too do doing i during were we that herself over but as after no whom theirs myself above over are than own themselves can such what only against me no it out me during can below themselves did between all not against don each an below yours about their again and other i over s which now or were any can her not her whom nor each off does had out once but nor do such this where yourself can she why some do further their itself to had they your themselves our it they who too hers does against through to herself at have down the over what your at were again there their who into yourselves we in our me this in for as me own why him himself does you each its such herself these where between itself my in does has be theirs other against for our he now just with off but until had these they t whom should it been both more or all yours while her yourself or has yourselves he after herself her same when if there myself s her did but myself at was against an now nor had against further s out about s has by all her were whom own t not himself just on is they when not theirs yours with are now not again will to other these once was will or be under and while my my i an itself only out itself only will themselves with it if same most further than when it s don yours its were to your am herself all of that his down to in yours be other until have had you but will s further out but i you while out hers will been off her so off no why in it into that yourselves just myself don yourself an does other for nor but a before before this such more with you this below who be doing after all
