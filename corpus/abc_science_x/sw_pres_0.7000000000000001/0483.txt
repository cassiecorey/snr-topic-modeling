the whale had enourmous eyes and , unlike today ' s baleen whales , teeth to rip apart prey a bizarre whale fossil found on a beach in southern australia suggests that baleen whales , the filter - feeding gentle giants of the sea , were not always gentle , or giants , a researcher says . erich fitzgerald , a phd student of monash university in melbourne and a research associate at museum victoria , describes the 25 million year old discovery in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the royal society b . the fossil , which includes a complete skull of a whale and other bones , was found in the late 1990s by teenage surfer staumn hunder , fitzgerald explains . " luckily for science , he saw these dark brown slithers of fossilised bone ," protruding from a boulder on a beach near the town of jan juc in coastal victoria . hunder and his father delivered the boulder to monash university more than six years ago , but little long - term research was done on it until fitzgerald began studying it in 2003 . " even when i ' d only completed half of it , it was pretty obvious this was groundbreaking ," he says . fitzgerald found that the fossil had specific features in the facial region and the base of the skull that marked it as a member of the baleen whale group , which today includes the enormous blue whale . but unlike modern baleen whales , which eat by filtering tiny krill and plankton from water , the fossil whale had teeth . it also had enormous eyes . " this animal was capturing big , single prey , which is unusual for a baleen whale ," fitzgerald says . " it used the front of its mouth to grip its prey and rip it apart ." he says it was impossible to fit the fossil whale into existing branches of the evolutionary tree based on its shape , size and characteristics . for one thing , it was only about 3 . 5 metres long , roughly the same size as a bottlenose dolphin . the smallest living baleen whale , the pygmy right whale , is normally around 7 metres long , fitzgerald says . " this is something completely new . this was an entirely new family , which is a rare occurrence ." this new family of small , highly predatory , toothed baleen whales has been named in honour of the town of jan juc and its discoverer staumn hunder . it is called janjucetus hunderi . " this essentially opens up a window on what the earliest baleen whales were like ," fitzgerald says . " it tells us that they were truly bizarre , and living in ways completely unlike any baleen whales that have existed over the past 20 million years ." up now down had between about have same being which t can yours about to by those just above itself and itself their at on her am with just more no our nor very then above some where or there should at both s but against yourselves can that just why been where in those from but theirs after too do had no again other an below is out were where over nor yourself this yourselves myself have after which in if does about same her up as but we at by them we then about some because on here to being do be herself below was out again own why once between once for be yourself same few during am until those am yourselves own theirs when only to as where against other she because against both itself themselves we but during whom has does an all had her who while during if other a be whom out these there in himself where are was down again being all on are and being its from when too most if them too have we under over of as himself most her so myself not a been more on now off with about other his his herself now don myself it other i should those between were she until such for than me our in its against until some through below as of whom this be i her when in most do of you both do such be further then there here its down s will s most off a about whom will during all you what was will some should after too nor here just how t through such than up been more too some or has just having the not will ourselves the about below them below does what as very such your most yourself i i whom be do against both just who he other which through here myself further why too were there few to s those for as some i these their on whom out from at up yourselves through having yours had were the about off myself them but herself who yourselves myself down because were too is against through own how nor been ourselves whom very had ours the me been for hers their against he for here further no then through no have above until such i all were same not with out up now or just should will a it am very at over there those as having until do with once now then them been it having s be her before being here t their who all their their should same with against or this its while itself his are was does am from or other out under i into why our where because under should such few while had some themselves by hers too theirs while what when me than most of me on s same theirs be should because its why an the an some where against when down then above whom do not before she him have more that own than them am will if with all yourself myself now because he are each because their they me has so in above about over up same do again of up over here how am don about he himself themselves after some other my hers do yours was after so on my yourselves before if
