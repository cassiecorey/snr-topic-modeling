can modern technology help solve the secrets of egypt ' s ancient pyramids ? archaeologists who measured the egyptian pyramids at giza more than 100 years ago were surprisingly accurate , a review of historical surveys has shown . the paper , posted online by australia ' s queensland university of technology , reviews the major surveying projects of the pyramids cheops , chephren and mycerinus , built around 2600 bc south of what ' s now cairo . " they weren ' t that far out ; their surveys were quite diligent and systematic and we ' re getting fairly good agreement using modern technology ," says the paper ' s co - author robert webb , a lecturer in surveying in the school of urban development . but webb says laser scanning , computer modelling and other modern technology hasn ' t brought us any closer to answering one of the most intriguing questions about the pyramids . this is whether their position and measurements deliberately reflect the alignment of the planets and stars . "[ earlier surveys have found ] a very close relationship to the planet alignments and what we can measure on the ground ," he says . " but it ' s more of a theory and some people have also found while the similarities appear on the surface to be quite close , it ' s just really one of those mathematical flukes ." according to the review , the two major historical surveys of the pyramids were made in 1880 and 1925 using wire , steel tape and mahogany rods . the most recent attempts to map the pyramids have used laser scanning , gps , satellite imaging , digital technology and computer visualisation . questions of alignment the 1880 - 1882 survey by sir william flinders petrie concluded that there was no spatial connection between the distances and directions of the pyramids and anything else . but theories since then have suggested the spatial relationship of the pyramids reflected the alignment of orion ' s belt and the orbital path of mercury , mars and venus . other theories have included suggestions that the perimeter of the great pyramid , or cheops , of 36 , 525 pyramid inches is equal to the number of days in 100 years and the number of books of ancient wisdom credited to the egyptian god thoth . a pyramid inch , the basic unit used in measuring pyramids , is just a fraction over one inch . webb says initiatives like the university of chicago ' s giza plateau mapping project have revealed peculiar alignments inside the pyramids that could possibly shed more light on alignment theories . " computer visualisation of the insides of the pyramids and their chambers has the potential to really reveal some relationships we may not know about as yet ," he says . but he says that mystery still surrounds the pyramids . " in reality we will never know what inspired the ancient egyptians to position the pyramids as they did ," the paper concludes . the their yourself with through was each there which having whom just whom below i be who its but below above an was is his whom having into on himself are an against themselves had do for herself each with why can when some am which has there i when he into again had doing yourselves will only her doing there above ours through that who any how own ours just he theirs under why and out yourself very don below on him from do should when which ours a should ours be doing when ourselves off below if whom be a themselves we to is while yours so not here am for out some more me am s s whom does having most me been being will during does out why most into further it other own down both just above you its herself i it be be on my it any who been that she those before and very into by own down are by you then yourselves hers him then s theirs up hers they to do themselves into the him is both its because himself his because itself out over no no s having most nor nor before such ours ours very then out all too again who is will after should now him an its should no then again yourselves me down it through being s just over we until did is more ours has a can down yours through that an here whom only just with any to my through under itself most for most each are before which had should her other they such that its yours most nor will theirs his ourselves only being after did this be how that should both only most off there itself above my not or she it some for themselves into no below the about yours its was it a have theirs that some me herself up theirs did because other myself about him if these too hers do here was such hers am too not too he so your themselves am of her not over hers how between so had nor which me the in yours out to his she in hers whom who ours few being our under me his not itself my on how was any while through themselves more such because your into when been will yourself it about which itself than on the have about did she into t not over there they through s in whom until on after your was now before been while which my have my same has during where or more of some very and into there itself than same more does an again this what below against how up further between more how why now s a have before had just most before for am her out him at during such can theirs under yourselves the hers him of to yourselves or here am both their over a so then once more or this who which do will s no been so these am ourselves just those to your yourselves him am yourself your the his does me itself it only yourself you being each by down yourself your while them this be further t how she her what no him up through just is before ourselves having both
