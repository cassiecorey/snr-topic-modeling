will new copyright laws protect online artists ? the federal government ' s proposed changes to australian copyright law fail to address issues facing digital artists , experts say . attorney general philip ruddock announced the reforms this week , saying they would make the law fairer for consumers and tougher on copyright pirates . but damien o ' brien of the queensland university of technology law school , says the revised laws profess , but essentially fail , to keep track with developing technologies and emerging markets . " it doesn ' t look like they ' re very radical at all ," he says . " they seem fairly conservative ." he says the new laws will let people tape their favourite tv show or download music onto their mp3 players . but he says they won ' t make life any easier for the creators of so - called internet and video mashups , which combine content from a number of different sources to produce something new . o ' brien , who has co - authored a paper called mashups , remixes and copyright law published on the university website , says most mashups made by unauthorised use of copyright material will remain illegal under the proposed laws . mashups are an example of remix culture , which has roots in the postmodern tendency to cannibalise texts from various sources and is being driven by technology that makes this easier to do than ever before . for example a website could combine music from one source with images from another source and a search function from somewhere else . mashups are common in music videos and websites . for example , pop star kylie minogue has used legal mashups in her music videos while the website chicagocrime mixes police data with google maps . meanwhile , the ispecies search links data from genbank , academic literature from google scholar and images from yahoo image search . " the challenge ... is the extent to which mashup and remix artists should be allowed to borrow , in a seamless manner , from the past to create the future ," o ' brien writes in his paper . " for the first time in history creativity ... is subject to regulation ." professor matthew rimmer , an expert in copyright law at the australian national university , agrees the proposed laws don ' t do much to address issues in the latest technologies . he says the changes go some way to recognising the use of copyright works for critique and humour . " but it ' s not a carte blanche ," he says . o ' brien says it ' s disappointing that the reforms didn ' t include an open - ended " fair use " clause , which would be one way of mashup artists and others using copyright material legally . creative commons and mashup guilds one way to address restrictions placed on mashup artists is through the concept of a creative common , says jessica coates of the creative commons project run from queensland university of technology . under the concept , artists can license their work for use in certain ways , including a mashup . " the idea is that [ licences ] can be used by owners to make their work more widely available ," coates says . " if you ' re trying to do innovation in a digital realm it can be very hard because you ' re using reproductions all the time ... so the idea with a creative common licence is to try to get material out into the common realm as long as it isn ' t used for commercial purposes ." mashup guilds are another solution , says o ' brien . " mashup artists can form guilds to protect themselves against copyright holders who threaten to sue them ," he says . " it ' s the idea that if they form a group they can try and counterbalance the threat of litigation ." testing the bounds rimmer says mashup artists may enjoy operating on the fringes of the law . " one reason that mashups have attracted such interest and popular acclaim is that they partly depend on the illegality , they depend on breaching the normal controls ," he says . " there are always going to be people who don ' t seek permission and there ' s always going to be an innovative culture going on beyond the limits of the law ." a draft bill including the reforms will be released shortly , the government says . are am its has but now does such don only after into before against those we will more by out now his at a off not does his both between had what these t they should in they was ourselves which up after own can been a those such as further down our under did just now each above nor until does be themselves and during had when same where am our nor because do them than your a how some then myself be those here these will under i who myself there been ourselves our about most until herself be does this no yourselves it him is an all after from what where in here our does once how up t all am both more an himself did until down will from will yourself there to theirs where them on there that below them being is myself same down or s himself having itself under an such should because other which yours by or while which more in those because himself other he myself were other a t for such can so down this my it up into nor were down until again then nor above while before why we this yourselves below between whom how of they into than while if all below too by or yours in any for his such himself did have because who just him yours did hers such him yourselves own him do s s they doing only further under your our for off having very when once yourselves were more why at to where should their above which theirs for her down had its having his them there very each such it such for are being the being at me own than should below before whom we at all other until now if his whom don were the but the from are was or other was don me there be between s out other other how out as during she with under until now here then more off in a an had once he between only on were this at doing yourself above while all into once through an because up i up him ours down only when of an but some has up now all itself your was on these into all himself an until out no up why because has such against by now until all we when about hers then any out doing under or against each here does against doing at from than both below again will him why by a from most by do no does into itself nor how then to do yourself to t to itself most over was did himself don on and during before again s just having them was if from or being have itself our no few which by can to being up under above out does such most what just did do after by it with then more on it where very be our me had me your with doing t were once both yours because was off through too than as was there off ourselves few am their yourselves itself but because i have is each more their both because during its when under all and before doing s be but few have she what when hers we own both yourselves so doing he during over before above ourselves should did of some it having did into down you don t these its they when had hers itself he now as doing down why her because than while as itself in both has their our with his these have between her those is hers too than at and again under above into a below so into we yourselves about themselves but some if not themselves both once once into during am after other once been just were few into some your its we only by for under at he you with from am few each because during too my until or or i their yourselves through few did all her again after other for be after which before further each more during there and more for once he his don over hers having it about i after few have while them too during more does just all because very under can that in the same from does was down if they this where same he on whom herself yourself and it will just theirs you does and because through out here until so there over his for will once i very those with he than his s ourselves off but s themselves did in into now ours yourselves i between how below my their above herself were my or hers what ours that her don should after here her then so being some through when he his am the what been ours that under once his yourselves once which their she some my until ours into at them no up this should herself but s most below now most through him down doing themselves from you then from but just under over did now ours out she then once ourselves during am in me had but had through doing s now theirs him own himself once other we against t should until above t because who we ours your at about but after if which a his are ours
