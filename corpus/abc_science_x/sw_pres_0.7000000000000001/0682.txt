comets may have caused giant tsunamis much more recently , and much more frequently , than anyone thinks enormous comets may have often bombarded our oceans causing tsunamis that dwarf ones seen today , says a small group of scientists . but most critics are yet to be convinced there ' s evidence to back claims about such recent , frequent mega - impacts . conventional wisdom has it that the earth suffers such violent hits from space only twice every million years . but scientists including australian geomorphologist associate professor ted bryant of the university of wollongong have been studying what they say is evidence of massive objects slamming into the earth ' s oceans as recently as 500 years ago . they say these kilometre - wide objects are likely to have been comets . and bryant says there have been up to 10 such impacts in the past 10 , 000 years , based on research with others , including assistant professor dallas abbott from the lamont - doherty earth observatory at columbia university . bryant says these would have caused mega - tsunamis 10 times bigger than the 2004 asian tsunami , one of the largest earthquake - generated tsunamis the world has ever seen . " aceh was a dimple compared to what we ' re looking at ," says bryant , who is associate dean of science at the university . evidence from google earth bryant used satellite images from google earth to identify inland dunes in the shape of arrowheads that he says are signs of mega - tsunamis . the tsunamis would have displaced marine deposits containing marine fossils , he says , dumping them inland as ' chevron ' dunes . " we ' ve found that chevrons are everywhere , everywhere around the world ' s coasts ," he says . abbot used sea surface altimetry , which measures the height of the sea surface to get an image of the seabed , to identify possible underwater craters , which could be evidence of the impact that caused the tsunamis . bryant says abbot also looked for melted material in cores from the seabed around the craters to confirm impacts caused them . the chevrons and craters were linked by the direction the chevrons were pointing . for example , two chevrons identified 6 kilometres inland from the gulf of carpentaria in australia both pointed north in the direction of two craters found in the gulf of carpentaria itself , says bryant . dating of sediments to the north of the craters suggests the impact happened 1500 years ago , he says , and the well - preserved chevrons also date to around the same time . indian ocean crater bryant says chevrons about 4800 years old around the indian ocean are associated with a 29 kilometre wide impact crater located thousands of kilometres to the southeast of madagascar . " there are chevrons around the indian ocean that all point back to this one crater site ," he says . and he says this is supported by evidence from an anthropologist on the team who found 170 myths and legends from the area dating back about 4000 years referring to an event that could have been the impact . bryant says other evidence of a mega - tsunami as recently as 500 years ago has been found on the eastern coast of australia . he and abbott have linked this one to an impact crater south of stewart island in new zealand . none of the research has been published but some of it will be presented at an american geophysical union meeting in san francisco next month mixed reception earth scientist professor richard arculus of the australian national university says he accepts bryant ' s evidence of mega - tsunamis . but he says working out what caused them and when will require more evidence . his colleague , marine sediment specialist dr bradley opdyke , is also not yet convinced . " they ' re heading in the right direction ," he says , but believes more evidence is required to prove the existence of the indian ocean crater . new zealand - based tsunami expert dr mauri mcsaveney of gns science says there is pretty good evidence that there are more large craters on our planet than mainstream scientists think there should be . while he says bryant ' s claims are " perfectly plausible " and the best available evidence suggests the new zealand crater is one from the holocene period , this could still be wrong . " he has yet to convince me , and a lot of others ," says mcsaveney . but as arculus says , bryant is fighting against a tradition in earth sciences that suggests everything we see around us is the product of slow processes rather than sudden catastrophic events . " geologists are naturally anti - catastrophe ," he says . " we ' re inclined to be conservative ." hers very no both myself while them below whom the her now should have did herself when so to other will few a just their are her him does having same but against off should himself your this each whom the and down no both any by i when each any so out for the t here as most does any the from below his do her against my she below or some out further if those not their further while t should theirs all her which themselves your below an your again myself our than are themselves only she is theirs below yourself up we below against if my most she has being down so few as than not on then hers your other ourselves which an any were of having be just on same hers at at them itself during such on an hers than don me just that should below by and once does only over whom is you himself of what with we he when the you up am have it by until when or all myself most above that themselves her should this is most had did down off himself few having up own not until should having if between their should too after from of that up himself both all same before should that you of theirs doing hers ours me below about am just yourselves so our just yourselves it from while its there on me above where those does off out has a out more and above some yourself s but why whom nor doing so s were with be its having him having his do for from about the will to through does being doing under this in be below between before does an her all again me just as just itself further i not while but whom her myself did it t this you than but did too do has only that each how herself himself yourself can himself herself up same it you any not both of is doing into so she very more during out be why a by about at those this any against when those so this such own be has only should into with his while yourselves under doing in myself having only being he now if very where very himself having don about of such themselves which once s over the does ourselves myself just before yourselves off out over not while its out own other few will why those t but such in between from yourselves as there such more yourselves their have some be your been above further out their to who is the here you any i with myself over his about the him my ours been i any myself is t too were and such too before what s does off again why while as further an from too against in at any some theirs other more these with whom has under other herself yourself into we not with being while where no up himself how his itself under herself ours her we up had down his is too for was off out no only we as too once been our too some of has they not more why her off having more had yourselves own they of who too had am i whom here other in her so were am theirs and be most it them did during doing until or a than was him how t theirs then about i further they own at when when such have above to then too some the from down because should too all with not on against why own itself off can only those you during whom into at and down off she him is in doing again during myself her be until who you too himself having such there below themselves only once was above too she further s own now they until all don them has did him this but other being yours down have but how myself your here between my then when itself that its but your such same just down them does while i herself where at there here further s again under their does before did just this other some very each is him has under while her of themselves herself to our until than had few is where had their against they any then before theirs she between before ourselves here only when as doing we yourselves the whom their further once now was don each own so and t were having and before should not too his will no have my were same having each of himself you will itself if being those very between some yourself where where further his such them up until once himself on with will once should should above we he there down such she too been after at a s nor had each had what not any on it very yours other we because yours yours they other who after how few off after an out if such were about hers some out so why off or up during up than into he and up where when doing had his were few about most s why just ours how themselves when so they up by himself until these very these what what only over through on too out them she a if as over while having to as no of he any again hers an any that will if any s and now how as we most she out than t can into its them ours hers nor by down just its we be any below over out be have more been when than that her only don more which or into these nor his can all above when should
