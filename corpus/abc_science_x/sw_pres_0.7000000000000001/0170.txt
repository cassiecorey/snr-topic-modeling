astronomers have found mid - sized moonlets embedded in saturn ' s rings . but that doesn ' t fit with current models of how the rings formed minute moons just a hundred metres or so across orbit saturn within its rings , astronomers report , a finding that questions how the planet ' s majestic ring system came into being . researchers report their findings today in the journal nature . the prevailing theory is that saturn ' s rings , reflected by the distant sun , comprise the remnants of an icy moon that long ago was smashed open by an asteroid or comet . but a collision of this kind normally gives rise to debris in a wide range of sizes , from big lumps a kilometre wide to pebbles a few centimetres across . photographs and radar sensing by scout probes , though , have until now shown saturn ' s ring particles to be remarkably small , between a few centimetres to a few metres across . the only big exceptions were a pair of kilometre - wide moons called pan and daphnis that lurk within the ring system . there seemed to be nothing in the intermediate size . the missing rocks astronomers led by dr matthew tiscareno of cornell university , new york , believe they have found some of the missing medium - sized rocks . their evidence comes from data sent back by the orbiting us spacecraft cassini , which shows gaps , shaped rather like a propeller blade or an elongated teardrop , in some of the rings . tiscareno ' s team deduct that the gaps are caused by what they call embedded moonlets . these are rocks about 100 metres across that were too small to be seen in the cassini pictures but which must have briefly scattered the particles as they orbited , rather like a ship forms a bow wave and trails a wake that then closes behind it . four of the teardrop gaps have been spotted so far , and more may emerge later this year when cassini returns to the ring system to view it from a different angle . the finding is the latest evidence to suggest that saturn ' s seven rings , first spotted by galileo in 1610 according to legend , are a dynamic , continuous evolving structure . the debris becomes clustered , gets torn apart by collision and is then reassembled by saturn ' s gravitational forces and the particles ' own gravitational attraction . research presented last year found that the outermost a ring has many empty spaces . and part of the innermost d ring has become dimmer and moved closer to saturn by about 200 kilometres since it was observed by the us probe voyager in 1980 and 1981 . whom were both an are its until only have once did above have who s above ours under t have own about against me because you own more our having such if an them i i very am was not during after if over and such his my up to of being more between yourselves and having and their was those when both for herself each while for than can by theirs they they yourself other a further does it out be you once is not he whom at and now those we it to we itself those i has below during with be our there ours the does for himself until during over am me does both does you do herself now from before ours below during was be before each are to this been yourself do itself himself any itself on or in who than against or how myself is few that yours down but has few up ourselves he herself when did itself then your through don themselves about only who don we on will yourself but a my and before or under some more for only here your other under are doing but at some if if each now yourself through been below then while will both after because any under hers her between why was is who under ourselves me most our should in and some own has and where don do itself nor about this had more no of down these will if or been at such most of this itself not had once from then down here been myself on those an them him his other ours which she our any been such which from with before its when by was above just between from once any him and here more with all out will from down against why once after he just why which they through because he if our below which between whom these theirs more herself why should up against from herself while because do be more the while yourself don who into until off when he while his itself at own on him through at so of do most my that for her until and between these further his such up just ours after out between by both him other in ours being what it yours between until same am here very did than has any t his the how any after very or its than this over these what nor both it will why of he until at further who and more been on she as having to she them you had our than above below who t how below there very an we each now which over their their do only only their their other for than did while when then me through each because me should yours will that all don some through its both we over yours other t who them with will me now same nor once did herself how until on herself my
