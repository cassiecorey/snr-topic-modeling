a wide variety of food helps brushtail possums eat and eat , without overloading their bodies with toxins brushtail possums can tell when they ' ve eaten too much of their favourite snacks , according to new research revealing their uncanny ability to regulate what goes into their mouths . unlike humans , who can pig out on chocolate or hot chips until we make ourselves sick , possums know exactly when they ' re starting to overload their system with toxins , says researcher dr karen marsh of the australian national university . " they ' re really good at regulating their intake and knowing exactly how much they can eat ," she says of the marsupial herbivores . marsh reports in a recent issue of the journal ecology that the common brushtail possum ( trichosurus vulpecula ) thrives when it eats a wide variety of foods , rather than a limited range . the reasons for this have been unclear in the past . but marsh says her study supports one of the leading theories , which suggests that possums are better able to neutralise small amounts of naturally occurring toxins from a variety of foods than a high - toxin load from a single food . food toxins because of its plant - based diet , the brushtail possum eats foods that not only contain nutrients , but potentially toxic by - products . it neutralises these in various ways , for example , by oxidising the toxins or converting them into different molecules . if the possum only eats one food it will reach the threshold for that particular toxin faster than if it selects from a wider smorgasbord . " basically they seem to be able to recognise whether toxins are similar or different and feed accordingly ," marsh says . " what we think happens is that the toxins activate the emetic pathways in the body so the possums start to feel sick when their detox pathways get saturated ." getting rid of toxins marsh tested the hypothesis by identifying various toxin thresholds in the possums and working out how each was eliminated by analysing metabolites in their urine . she then offered the possums a range of foods with similar toxin pathways and a range of foods with different pathways . she found the possums ate less when the foods activated similar pathways . marsh says it ' s important to understand the mechanisms that regulate diet in possums because it can help in their conservation . " we want to know what sort of habitat is going to be suitable for them ," she says . " can they survive in a habitat that ' s been degraded and only has one type of plant , or do they really need that mix ... so they can be swapping between the different plants ?" she says humans should have the same responses to food toxins , but most toxic metabolites have been eliminated from our food , making us more prone to overeating . theirs yours whom before t from only your only hers most why having once while after you myself below because because her your now if nor s had before his been under me if ourselves before on up are did no all s we have his we once both it whom with so did her same her has for who does yours both only it did did as do most out yourselves herself through his or having why yourselves ours again she them this i me your under was your me any because can some did themselves has him can such he over just it yours of your me yours how nor with a themselves so all but do all can very again were few while if other other such above having ours its we which but with them with under up were be no during all does does t at him into before before but under and me we then up this other how or each until most below during up me below then now why should having too which them once the here them some its of after myself t which until did now then some his my over or this ours while out their did own her but was just doing being than have ourselves your this then these where are yours been there why your while then as are ourselves because we there how can too same too i from to ours our up myself their of these now below while own more there so which did such being he but nor him it before have yourself what same most itself these very itself can are are during than those now this up she which a other itself own s theirs each or t be being an in off of such before ourselves between its any same down nor he down a only over at which our themselves after as not had at why off now too yours a where off have during on in does against further because they yours to s whom then having them does his how from she after through so further why does at this t or own has our ours where on should some own don and will few further should while how each there should nor in until having too you should now down these he ours our to of about myself most ourselves down we our what doing under between on them her on when hers of until up my through we over yourself not were into further who was only out myself itself with had should you in until on did hers the it the these them here i from him over to should below both there further here was further what not no don him its i between with itself all whom ourselves for did why such me now off being with during same at she than
