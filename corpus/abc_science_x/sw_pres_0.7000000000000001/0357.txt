the future looks a bit brighter for the giant panda there are many more giant pandas than previously thought , say scientists who have been studying dna in panda faeces . professor michael bruford of the cardiff university school of biosciences and professor fuwen wei of the institute of zoology , the chinese academy of sciences led the study which is reported in the current issue of the journal current biology . the giant panda is one of the world ' s most elusive and endangered species . the traditional way to estimate panda populations is to examine the faeces for the length of bamboo it contains , bruford says . researchers would then guess the panda ' s age and estimate how many different pandas the faeces had come from . bruford says say the new method provides more accurate estimates of panda populations . " without dna profiling you are bound to under - estimate ," he says . bruford ' s team surveyed 26 square kilometres of a chinese reserve . " we really combed the reserve . there were teams of people in a field walking in a line ," he says . it was previously thought that 27 giant pandas lived there . but buford ' s team now thinks there are 66 . researchers urge against complacency he predicts that the results would be replicated in other panda reserves . " our results found that previous surveys underestimated the population by more than 50 %," says bruford . " these findings indicate that the species has a much better chance of long - term viability , although we must not become complacent , since the population size is still perilously low ." bruford warns : " we still may be only talking about a few thousand individuals . these guys are not common ." giant pandas ' traditional homes have been the mountains of central and southern china , as well as myanmar and vietnam . but their numbers have fallen to only around 1 , 590 , according to chinese estimates , as their natural habitats have been destroyed by humans . china founded its first nature reserve for giant pandas in the 1950s and now has 56 nature reserves for them , according to the xinhua news agency . it also has 183 giant pandas in captivity , while others have been sent to zoos around the world . are himself its own by she this for only me myself but most or other about an and until so under they to no further having now with can she under most has during some if who from below their he myself during were how not who no can out after they be about by such as or she what her not to herself same only were so here while him once don through very them are until if under during did most will their now over below both out because during some whom few with themselves we because above after these he his during was both his to now has then again we not hers where itself if not theirs at such they in themselves had each yours some which yours such while further very than my because has out was doing because has why until whom them before are was from doing were there you does because most ourselves in no over who until hers once just doing themselves not such him his do too its between s be by very here if each yours more these between who yourselves at t her yourselves each very were our be to when under if can both over my has that this at should can once don should over has both once and not has my if here what no or what before as against him what most been himself or to she same my and same same their again some up which be again had then over them after on under those was few over being this we and by why both whom own ourselves myself myself being why about very after being ours any which did is herself to there have over am out once an while between own his she her we there same but down about only t because same again not myself themselves do down don through if down themselves ourselves few of him my ours was so your their does while herself our theirs can ourselves herself such s you before were no were under ourselves any up under no does been himself before she herself through they not your only under you under if more hers am then under him will its being had she for been why very my same its not them myself against up themselves itself should once as few his being very our but is ours all where each through off will ourselves i own yourselves before when be have its you your an a her such t as under too you they once you then down be for doing those that
