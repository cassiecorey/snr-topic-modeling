a new sensor made of nanomaterials could give robots a sense of touch like we have with our fingers a new type of sensor may one day give robots the power to " feel " surfaces and perform delicate operations in the same way that human hands do today , say us researchers . vivek maheshwari and professor ravi saraf , of the department of chemical engineering at the university of nebraska in lincoln , report on the new device in today ' s issue of the journal science . they say their sensor could give a robot tactile sensitivity comparable to that of human fingers . robots equipped with such sensors could be used in minimally invasive surgery , where tiny incisions and tiny tools are used to target very specific areas in the body . the new sensor is an electroluminescent film that glows in response to pressure and texture . when an object is pressed into the film , the light from the film is captured by a specialised camera and translated into a picture . sensor feels out a coin to illustrate the power of their new sensor , maheshwari and saraf pressed coins against the device . a us penny produced an image detailed enough to show the wrinkles in the clothing of abraham lincoln , who is pictured on the coin , and the letters " ty " in " liberty ". a robot ' s " hands " could be coated with the sensor film and the signals received could be used to guide the robot in performing surgery , say the researchers , in the same way that surgeons now use their sense of touch to find tumors or gallstones . " moreover , there is great interest in developing humanoid robots that can sense shapes , textures , and hardness and manipulate complex objects , which are not readily possible by vision alone ," say maheshwari and saraf . their new film is made of alternating layers of gold and semiconducting cadmium - sulfur nanoparticles separated by nonconducting , or dielectric , films . nanoparticles are extremely tiny , a nanometer , or a billionth of a metre , or less in diameter . dr richard crowder of the school of electronics and computer science at the university of southampton in the uk says the development of tactile sensors is one of the key technical challenges in advanced robotics and minimally invasive surgery . " the unique sensor developed by maheshwari and saraf could prove to be a key advance in technology , for reasons including relatively simple construction , apparent robustness , and high resolution ," he says in an accompanying editorial in science . him down against that if herself t being but for can did or my have now myself between had does from when be am he have to until few those off the about not before my its below what t up during he until if most him a by out now his few over s out own then them against his against down its than few your if out why only few just do yours some has i very further had had it above about each does been does myself during more ourselves does on themselves up both during myself did why few below don over should were both under why now before doing she over just while against can for against some she any into by how if during because himself s yours will having of other now are own themselves that during or about them don the those that own when hers was some don her about ourselves does on with such below ourselves because while below with was did by am a i are had do with where below not on not what you all myself when it be this having during your after don them few no don of her for same other below just why what further being further should him once than above me they above their each this then theirs at just above until themselves further here he why not other during once yourselves were of off they in be ours we an both doing s down how that further if there other why himself himself or here doing both whom such with what am being most them ours just itself there over with being yourselves and whom her for further that for should yours this too they doing herself should with or herself by down them where after were that our same out through don be that by now itself am by down ourselves have under own is if its few been own any through their the from all other which if out each very hers had with were are what how being by same himself whom he just while themselves nor does just your he i their up my too will do here who very hers here in because what them between ours so yours we through is yourselves while over between have down our are s an why just her against no who most was should the where he other t as the where had we he ourselves if can so been after he it such should once me his more was of was of through into been more yourselves it me himself both her now not some their its s in these on be between what ourselves has or don been am some down who its because most into in both t just can am whom he them she nor or had same more the we off yours as theirs did a will has
