if your sex life isn ' t all smiles and fireworks , are you sick or just going through a rough patch ? and what ' s a normal sex life anyway ? consumers are being marketed drugs for premature ejaculation without good evidence there is a medical problem to be treated , an australian conference heard this week . us - based psychologist and sex therapist dr leonore tiefer , of the new york university school of medicine , told the inaugural conference on disease - mongering in newcastle this week , that premature ejaculation is " the next sexual dysfunction " to be marketed by the pharmaceutical industry . this concerns tiefer because she says sexual difficulties are generally not biological problems that need medical treatment . " there ' s no sickness , there ' s no pathology , nothing is broken ," she says . she says when men and women are counselled about what is distressing them sexually , rapid ejaculation is of low importance . tiefer says the way premature ejaculation is being marketed as a condition in need of treatment has " all the hallmarks of disease mongering ". first , she says , drug company - sponsored messages in the media have led to growing public awareness that premature ejaculation is regarded as a problem by experts who are measuring it , defining it and finding cures for it . these messages include " help - seeking " advertisements that urge people to " ask your doctor " about solutions to the problem . " the disease - awareness campaign is in full force at this point ," says tiefer . what ' s normal ? she says as a result people are now asking doctors what the normal speed of ejaculation is , and wondering whether they meet the normal standard . " the answer is there is no such thing as normal ," she says . " there ' s a range . some people are quick , some people are slow . most people are in the middle ." she says although there are no drugs yet specifically approved to treat premature ejaculation , doctors are treating the condition with available drugs that are known to slow down the speed of ejaculation . " doctors are getting a lot of medical education about the off - label uses of these drugs ," she says . " there are articles published , there are conferences organised around this and there are drug company - paid people going out there and saying you can use this for this ." tiefer says health and science journalists are also writing about premature ejaculation and the help available for it . poorly defined australian sociologist dr ross morrow of the university of sydney , who also spoke at the conference , agrees premature ejaculation is a " suspicious condition ". " to me this is a condition that is a very questionable medical category ," he says , adding that the condition is " poorly defined ". he says over the years there has been an attempt to define premature ejaculation according to the amount of time that lapsed , or the number of thrusts that occurred , before ejaculation occurred , but no agreement has ever been reached . morrow says the american psychiatric association defines it as persistent and recurrent ejaculation either before a man has intercourse , during attempts at penetration or very shortly after intercourse begins , in a way that is distressing to him or his partner . and he says the definition relies on a clinician ' s judgement about whether the ejaculation is occurring too soon or not . norms changing over time morrow also says norms about when men should ejaculate during coitus are constantly changing . for example , he says , a study in 1948 by alfred kinsey discovered three - quarters of men ejaculated within two minutes of coitus and regarded this as acceptable . " he didn ' t think that was a dysfunction ," says morrow . " he actually thought that was a sign of men being sexually responsive ." but morrow says during the 1960s the period of time to ejaculation considered normal by experts was extended . he says this coincided with a belief that women ' s lack of sexual satisfaction during intercourse could be addressed if her male partner could take longer to ejaculate . morrow also says different cultures have different norms about how long men should take to ejaculate , citing the case of one melanesian culture that considers ejaculation after 15 to 30 seconds normal . morrow says in australia premature ejaculation is often mentioned in the same advertisements discussing erectile dysfunction , and is sometimes referred to under the banner of " ejaculatory problems ". he says antidepressant drugs used to delay or inhibit ejaculation are being currently used in impotency clinics in australia and sex therapists are also treating the condition using cognitive behavioural therapy . female premature ejaculation ? both tiefer and morrow are also concerned about the notion of " rapid orgasm ", the female equivalent of premature ejaculation . " i think it ' s part of a transformation of sex from a subjective experience into a concrete performance , almost like a sport with rules and goals and achievement standards ," says tiefer . " so you can define very clearly whether your performance is up to part and in that way products can be provided for you to achieve performance ore even exceed those expectations ." we against s into because these did such before does s a that he s too if a more don ourselves so here itself too if most its each of herself being those here itself in so if because itself too has from for their so be my between he does does by of up most those each during because if a or had how themselves all only very me why don if can been in not any some why the just each are when can himself a theirs who further from while such do further more can am t all with not after to down if himself to after did ours if his both any through which yourselves below by down has i as just how each then should up has itself below she both himself do they yourselves who down because once against your if just do nor such and am and same theirs where now some me now do just some which on them during do himself can few each than how in between had only both until after did don to was before t by we what by after were ours can are will of having out their does who can before does yourself then there ours down under myself do so but those if these again themselves my it off against theirs or so that herself of any who who are my themselves more does being hers when than hers s over then no while than those before off were from before both or yours she an t have so herself her to t for the only with other don them themselves from a during where your if below so have any should been did about on were had her himself how where or does we and such but while than that who too it were to an at t the s by and or they an can into you s down but up ours as if her few those only on very nor so will our being between few theirs does other because but she her if were ourselves can why such once while those than if was when this where which under from yourselves with my there itself who these they all and while too ours yourself can than each i against them only other out himself had yourselves being which through on yourself my them t a him because yours an here it down is not will when further my too having will you her which then myself theirs she whom has again t himself same yourselves most just which all our of from so himself some them than too down of our yourselves once too into few than this then on t her from in here our while after he do of who don the nor more through was with nor them about herself does only whom itself can few such myself what did your doing him s all because too just such at who has down as he there down yourself or been who own are most that that a myself its most hers few me me with our same an during few an can then those such her a most ours being off further him down if all each your now above don been she other does until who through t up until theirs she nor some she with above at the in which too which ours you them were how yours there for before of again other same no most against some those very yourselves i of between such to but can ours very before between against over you ourselves are other they through now don when during do each this of t our off while you do those her again other very hers most there not while is my when yourselves she into no now but yours during below if over very very where our some she to or being over yourself do between doing ours yours did some few him you been can yours if don more your for after that was both being have him again at ours by all and but too if to up an themselves very having by where all only t my no he from these ourselves whom few further when their own she at those they don have having both because can because s him that me by where under be been more most further up up do to themselves whom and on few and there your their will by your after our herself own had should from be myself as been some am are own further am his i themselves while they a that a of those then will from do above be further are having at his while herself some because other yours her how off by then am while when until between to they then they these about off theirs what very me as further or ourselves ourselves what only between here was to by only while are herself doing its theirs such same has for above having further to off few be here his or until too t over ourselves them her when up own too between themselves himself than doing through with did this why will we s by these now until any he such my these those been him because are all nor we than against about before is had will myself these no there it when how were nor then him each i at very was nor out and below on under only when too who during themselves both when once only been what out which more just your
