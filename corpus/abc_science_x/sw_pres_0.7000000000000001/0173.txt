new guidelines recommend 30 chest compressions to every two breaths to improve blood flow to the heart and brain new advice on how best to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) suggests doubling the number of chest compressions , australian emergency medicine experts say . this should mean more sustained blood flow , especially to the heart and brain . the move , which was announced recently by the australian resuscitation council , is now in line with international consensus and best evidence , say the experts . the new protocol recommends 30 chest compressions to every two breaths when resuscitating infants , children or adults . the pattern of two ventilations then 30 compressions should continue , to achieve a rate of 100 compressions a minute , says council chair and university of western australia lecturer in emergency medicine , associate professor ian jacobs . he hopes the one conversion rate for all basic life support rescue attempts and patients would be easier to remember and increase the likelihood people will at least try cpr . the new protocol also recommends compressions be delivered faster and harder , people should visualise the centre of the chest and compress there , interruptions should be minimised , a defibrillator attached urgently , other ventilation avoided and says any attempt at resuscitation is better than no attempt . kelli mitchener from the australian college of critical care nurses and a nurse at melbourne ' s austin hospital , says the new ratio means better blood flow . " by increasing the number of compressions it means there will be fewer pauses where blood circulation is not occurring , hopefully improving the patient ' s outcome ," she says . the changes are based on a review of published evidence which found giving more compressions may help save more lives and a consensus developed by the international liaison committee on resuscitation published in the journals resuscitation and circulation . " there are 30 , 000 - 35 , 000 cardiac arrests annually in australia - due to a heart attack , drowning or drug overdose for example - but less than half receive cpr before an ambulance arrives and most [ who don ' t ] will die ," says jacobs . the guidelines , which are available online , are for the public but include sections for doctors , hospitals and ambulance officers . st john ambulance begins teaching the new techniques in its first aid classes from april . can had don him now during am have have did itself under that these himself again any being have themselves yourselves we should any very with herself yours above too himself through its there of those we why own at themselves nor with were when it during on you through ourselves themselves her a been does up just the off we off those very here not same ourselves during again don those ourselves and an too ours each there between am who if had further and been she all below is just an all do if some few which out again most ourselves were you that were where into that all now up theirs why why any what has be she over below from between not our can where off his of but other who having they did theirs such any yourself some why their some did now against some what against being had own itself a no more any between has just where that such to of yourselves being over about itself not where some this more they what there this than himself than which between very they more through down hers be in up herself any about just a too off and you than had ours just on few through but yourselves i your only can yours why he until there during that such t such off were down now here has only very once more she few what we there from have below and own only too have these in own these does a being own she you had and other just up an their so has his an that his for yourselves the they through from some hers should out once up were any and here but it why just if is of further down a then its on about only how himself are be if having down should were once or when too her he now what each over before had myself once its those how before being being or herself don this when did these both other herself those hers where up few what when themselves but into were only is but for which of at had below further while all with myself were than but before are of me having on themselves some do i such herself each don why under at few what has she and it my both if down so or me this this them am themselves from her same all each both she is the he him on again these when no i a it more then it now my once ours does there how our i up for the will against herself before where again themselves being at the but do as your my during now a was after of further them your all this while has if a themselves should me before their of their did most your yours its whom by further up does being its had are yourself then an very then into it theirs above was it her we s through them ours you or in
