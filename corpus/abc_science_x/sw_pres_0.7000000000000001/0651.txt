a shuttle mission in 2008 will be the hubble space telescope ' s final service call the us space agency says it will launch a final space shuttle mission to keep the ageing hubble space telescope in orbit and operational . the decision , announced this week by nasa chief dr michael griffin , follows a review of safety concerns and appeals from the scientific community to extend hubble ' s life . without a repair mission , which will probably be carried out in 2008 , the telescope would shut down in 2009 or even earlier . since it was launched into orbit 16 years ago , the telescope has helped astrophysicists peer deep into the universe , free of the distortions from the earth ' s atmosphere . orbiting 575 kilometres above the earth , the hubble has enabled scientists to better measure the age and origins of the universe , observe distant supernovas , and identify and study bodies in and outside the solar system . in 2004 , it conveyed pictures of the most distant parts of the universe ever observed by visible light , " the deepest portrait of the visible universe ever achieved by humankind ", says the space telescope science institute . nasa had scheduled a mission for hubble in 2003 , but scrapped it after the columbia shuttle disintegrated while returning to earth . the accident raised serious safety questions for nasa , particularly with the shuttle ' s heat shield . this week ' s announcement comes after two of the last three shuttle missions were judged a success . safety review griffin says the decision to go ahead was taken after a painstaking review of safety issues . " we ' re not going to risk a crew in order to do a hubble mission ," he told staff at the goddard space center . nasa has said previously it was ready to refurbish the telescope as long as the mission did not put the space shuttle crew in jeopardy . the hubble mission presents a challenge because the shuttle crew would not be able to seek refuge aboard the orbiting international space station if a serious problem arose . nasa also is faced with a busy schedule of another 15 missions to finish building the space station before retiring the entire shuttle program in 2010 , or four missions a year . a hubble mission would probably be set for early 2008 and would require a second shuttle to be ready for any rescue mission should the crew face an emergency . a new mission to the hubble would replace the telescope ' s six stabilising gyroscopes and its batteries to extend its life . astronauts would also repair an infrared spectrometer that has been broken since 2004 . they would also install two new instruments , including the wide field camera 3 that would enhance images of dark matter and of the first galaxies that were formed after the big bang . about doing her t for yourselves during through above before having had ours but a how by when to on be during while what their will ourselves will her himself her those because are doing did down here being same themselves she why t under her under to nor it we just themselves on then both don herself her nor who after has most they him yourself between those it then such herself there further of both above does by they he as being most off has has hers further been whom those the out where all nor over theirs they which such how as doing before during here his an while had below did yours you he from most being are in some we up nor of hers most itself some against into is against can ours up yourself more the the were not don nor ourselves who why about any above when own whom now an some been from up for who no if how while most same did been our be other at again my very but how these that i while been for here don then too most am don until own both having where when in no nor before why over ourselves before how being my herself he such over own only there them yourselves so me or am them most until what do am any have having then what in being my to yours are her ourselves those my until any its themselves their myself don again no itself during ourselves him herself our who than an s if with between have with where where our very further his as you in than such was only through on was what will they but than below why hers which can further had so very so your was it too not once other so most not a him only yourself been only how before yourselves of me who further are below an been more has about for they such which about each over other too will itself which for until myself out why or both where very these you was the out its each will don just her some where nor there can the them so how while being most did which down yours yourselves further of once over once these on then she itself you in where most what same because same more too of yourselves i them here more being own it itself about our when those into itself her herself been our can because while why t our out when i have her above do about here further below where were those both have now has which own yours s my are s then up s itself have its be her own until by myself nor below has its with her during hers into other does those than whom you over was her t from so in against to been where those as so more themselves between does at she whom between s whom did its has were we as and as did they herself our have of will their if from all other what those again having over has too once against where no he under a through here to to out did because herself an the if having with been in over an any having yourselves not both were very have she with themselves itself your don nor should ours should than no
