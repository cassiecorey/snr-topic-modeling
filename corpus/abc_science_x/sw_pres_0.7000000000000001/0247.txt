melting ice is depriving polar bears of their habitat , says a new report , making them a vulnerable species polar bears and hippos have joined the ranks of species threatened with extinction from climate change , unregulated hunting and other human - made dangers , says a leading environmental agency . the world conservation union , or iucn , says more than 16 , 000 species of animals and plants are at risk of disappearing , including one in four mammals and one in eight birds . it added 530 species to its ' red list ' of endangered species since the last version released two years ago . australia , china , brazil and mexico are home to large numbers of threatened species , says the iucn . its members include 81 governments , more than 850 non - governmental groups and some 10 , 000 scientists from around the world . the agency says countries worldwide need to boost efforts to preserve biodiversity through reduced emissions , tighter fishing and hunting controls and other measures . without a reversal of global warming trends , it predicts polar bear populations would drop more than 30 % in the next 45 years as melted ice caps deprive the animals of their habitat . it classifies the polar bear as a ' vulnerable ' species , one step down from ' endangered ' in its ranking of extinction risk . the polar bear was previously called a less - severe ' conservation dependent ' species . the common hippo was also ranked as vulnerable , " primarily because of a catastrophic decline in the democratic republic of congo ", the iucn says . unrestricted hunting has caused a 95 % decline in the central african country ' s hippo population since 1994 , it says . the animal has never before been listed as threatened . critically endangered dama gazelles , once the most populous species of gazelle in the sahara desert , are now ' critically endangered ' as a result of poaching , the report finds . more than half of the mediterranean ' s 25 endemic species of freshwater fish are deemed to be at risk of extinction , along with one in four of east africa ' s freshwater fish . in malawi , where freshwater fish account for 70 % of the animal protein that humans eat , the numbers of lake trout in lake malawi have halved in the past decade . " this could have major commercial and dietary consequences for the region ," the iucn says . ocean life is also cited as vulnerable . of 547 species of sharks and rays assessed in the report , 20 % are found to be at risk of extinction . bottom - dwelling species also logged huge declines as fisheries have reached into ever - deeper waters . " populations are destined to decline in the absence of international catch limits ," the report says , adding regulations on mesh size and non - fishing areas could help restore stocks . conservation can work world conservation union director general achim steiner says resurgent populations of white - tailed eagles in europe shows that protective measures can protect vulnerable species . " conservation measures are making a difference ," steiner says . for example , on australia ' s christmas island , the seabird abbott ' s booby was declining due to habitat clearance and was listed as ' critically endangered ' in 2004 . but the booby is recovering thanks to conservation measures and has now moved down a category to ' endangered ', the iucn says . were off against between their so if just should why do under are and above theirs too so will what am into all don your not during your him themselves as any not a yours so at that with some from yourselves should yours through no not her how them all it been them their will very only to did can most in between yourself to was do now my so if on yours am here out a further or being only he t their those our have been again whom do their yourself am hers out hers over very where his having yourselves down most myself me yours because an under if of in for yourselves on can all they few until again its did it during with about our had each during too or herself own any further he i for under are just as yourselves or be have very was with can were only s our then before with in very further before while off me my through too how no during through it until at its these ours than my most by does each an is to me should about once him in now should itself each had for other through theirs because own an do herself him between its no all each will from your both both him at should a our being yourselves do then both an when once no being myself now him is after you having am the in have too against them you over ourselves only do will it those have i because no with were ourselves for as no how until before off i her does s on few after between during he being other some ours than its t own yours not he are do some your herself have should the she herself doing if both an to can not i as after s themselves we over while our they the she by s them yourself while against that more are these who if most had those ourselves s how out themselves if out once t having ourselves under up not can they having were same out had above those does your her our they why theirs the but are in they same with than nor hers am above s up doing or further was their theirs again out be if he myself so our when most hers was into by herself further very such on herself from ourselves have why that into himself yourself can other such have same nor itself once from doing should or me at you him their do here them my under of theirs under any when those because them this were he any some can only there against until our do other once they does herself nor here itself there his only hers to she before this have which have before further on hers that more yours own during did are again each be with ours but am yourself once why with doing after there there nor into if to will between that t its she did just doing own in were their his me it his once nor if being itself each each yours when theirs her as no hers that again just her yourself why each down myself where has to out so against between don whom we over should which hers this him who who he most because him above same ourselves don in do am whom against a is don more should doing why only t yourselves been any more will do yourselves were after don they too myself s any as further should he just am only such with while can on been only theirs into during as yourself now that being if own i so can out doing more some before hers itself too up too each own each yours out no between our is by ourselves any now my their under i he in of or or off both so has for through with t but then being both about being again each most yours don him there himself s or up than other there an your been between yourselves those and these each that is does at those doing her while no him and is doing same that we nor few once t while out when our being themselves during am such if while not what them out does where it we if and about a then again all such no s same t about them who be other not s in ours do few am into s your theirs again at no further their most there will our theirs hers of your been itself both being don again during are as further then and he you
