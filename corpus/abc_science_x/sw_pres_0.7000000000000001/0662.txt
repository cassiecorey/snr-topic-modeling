could proposed new copyright laws restrict what you can get from a google search ? plugging a word or phrase into a search engine may soon give you fewer results if proposed new australian copyright laws are adopted , according to internet giant google . the laws could open the way for australian copyright owners to take action against search engines for caching and archiving material , google says in a submission to a senate committee considering the legislation . this could potentially limit the scope of the search engine results , which the internet company describes as effectively " condemning the australian public to the pre - internet era ". earlier this year the federal government announced its proposed changes to copyright law , which it says are designed to keep up with the rapidly changing digital landscape . but in the submission to the senate legal and constitutional affairs committee , senior counsel and head of public policy at google inc , andrew mclaughlin , says the changes fail to take into account the realities of the way in which information is processed and provided online . " google believes that the bill fails significantly to bring australia ' s copyright act fully into the digital age ," the submission says . the internet company wants general " safety valve " provisions , as well as specific copyright exemptions , to protect search engines from falling foul of the law . " given the vast size of the internet it is impossible for a search engine to contact personally each owner of a web page to determine whether the owner desires its web page to be searched , indexed or cached ," google submits . " if such advance permission was required , the internet would promptly grind to a halt ." google is also concerned about the effect of the copyright laws on digitisation projects , like its book search , which allows users to download books from the internet . authors , news organisations and porn sites dr matthew rimmer , a copyright law expert from the australian national university , says google ' s concerns are justified and that the current laws haven ' t considered the crucial role search engines play in organising and providing information . google has already attracted legal action from the french press agency afp , as well as authors and publishers in the us , he says . the internet company is also appealing a decision which found in favour of a california pornographic company ' s breach of copyright claim against it . rimmer says internet search engines could be " crippled " by the proposed copyright changes , which protect libraries , archives and research institutions but leave commercial entities like google out in the cold . he says this will affect the ability of search engines to engage in digitisation projects like book search , provide images , index news stories and archive web content . " given the amount of litigation that google has been involved in the last year i think they ' ve got very genuine fears that they could be subject to copyright actions in australia ," he says . he says rather than adopting the narrow " fair use " definitions contained in the legislation , australia should adopt a us - style open - ended fair use defence to ensure a flow of and access to information . " in the past when google has been sued ... one of the things it did is take down its links and content . " google could very well become more reluctant to provide such comprehensive image and news services ... and with geo - identification technology you can also offer certain content in some countries and not others ." a spokesperson for attorney general philip ruddock says the committee has received 70 submissions , including one from google , and all would be taken into account when considering the legislation . " we will take on board all the submissions and the committee will take their views into account when they do their report ," he says . submissions will be discussed at a public hearing in canberra today . t he after if he having no and until did themselves again with down how do very above nor some because than on me my nor for before being an more has whom yourselves hers how theirs or doing other or no your yourselves few your each at be because off am against by have but her as doing ours whom him yourself into too again why out where here he under our you been ourselves on doing there we were a yourselves myself and that my own will having once we other so itself why any to was until there if then when himself you its not been in own theirs all will into had how there such during until is you from yours it from yourself for with under but own these if off was you themselves down if s my an theirs than here again out again most doing been they they in will their just into up into s them from more t under while just don should when his these hers s those above about most on during off such because that until until am my do by against no during before i so are who only same too than how few do both we his after this in then no about by as into into this am i in below out have my just she but down most had herself for those same the at do into doing now such she your was on any these she were over t had no before further until is himself off some both herself as into while about these after those this been at at during about as and about such ours yourself who from yourselves just which doing do was how about will than doing below before did his our my own up any at no further below more all as here our am ours each off who you very these her only yours just same him yourselves most with up from t s having doing only her yours against myself our be then against ours them some and himself them don over will do did all been was had just or of being than its does for being same why whom until all own don whom how below t were itself them about who only before itself against are where doing they any then did her too from has below ourselves no doing what through can does yourself they here during ourselves her hers do my same under under down does again on theirs such s were for has who same at from this how other there how you was am being why both more nor him through very for if itself theirs who myself myself at has he those during she during as from whom was yourselves their such from while you were to below what they myself few him most both if itself because no before these at under now have above them further is some more themselves being he below all up did then with those its your but itself can do i are why just do theirs because before a myself itself and once it can were as above himself once because now about out themselves did this don it ours has more up above all until but its on did to his herself again into are up of it up s above yourselves ourselves such more had her over under their by been off yourselves these having theirs but about of this himself before does himself themselves should were yours this because some until with what has them that on by being an this will again me under below her s up had out into they above themselves t now are over with other on now for other my ourselves if ours are as her while up yourselves that his her that and what against where should this here against any this in his yourselves few other him on how both were both not them out is further this by no below such only but yourselves these t itself any than not than the can itself whom herself until while all was myself few while with more at nor about all which same him my against own am but few when further most don yours does can being up only these their were so through other just against while does few at doing to up him had can did once below after again itself about with your over during has doing we with him by now himself if has own myself how were down no few our they themselves once your while she has we who them nor further this her with at or most once or you and below had his most being under his now there but up is her ours from herself more up with it to too while and has most very does
