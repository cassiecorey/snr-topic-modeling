banning the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics in animal feed means humans are more likely to respond to these powerful antibiotics if they need them reducing the use of antibiotics in food - producing animals leads to less drug resistance in humans , an australian study confirms for the first time . researchers examined samples from 585 people with gastroenteritis due to the nation ' s most common bacterial cause of foodborne disease , campylobacter jejuni . tests identified a low level of resistance to the fluoroquinolone group of antibiotics , which australia has banned in food - producing animals like poultry . one investigator , senior lecturer in epidemiology at the australia national university in canberrra , dr mahomed patel , says flouroquinolones are powerful , newer generation antibiotics that should be reserved for " pretty severe infections in humans ". the study found that only 2 % of the australian - acquired campylobacter infections were resistant to ciprofloxacin , a type of flouroquinolone . in countries that allow fluoroquinolones to be used in animals , ciprofloxacin resistant strains are up to 15 times more common in humans , studies show . drug resistance could make these infections hard to treat , lengthen bouts of diarrhoea and increase risk of serious or fatal illness . " the very low level of ciprofloxacin resistance in c . jejuni isolates likely reflects the success of australia ' s policy of restricting use of fluoroquinolones in food - producing animals ," researchers say in a paper to be published in the journal clinical infectious diseases . those tested were from queensland , south australia , victoria , tasmania and western australia , states that require reporting of patients infected with the bacteria , and were hospitalised with gastroenteritis or remained in the community . patel says it is unknown why ciprofloxacin resistance ranged from 0 % among tasmanian patients to 8 % in infected victorians . but as expected , there were much higher rates of resistance to other antibiotics among australian - acquired infections , especially those more commonly used by people in the community . international evidence he says this is the first australian study to support evidence seen in countries such as sweden and norway that banning use in animals means low rates of fluoroquinolone - resistant campylobacter infections in humans . " it confirms australia has remained relatively free of problems because we ' ve never used these antibiotics in animals ; avoiding animal use has prevented resistance in humans ," patel says . those infected outside australia were more likely to have a resistant strain , especially if they had travelled to asia . reasons could include contact with an infected person or eating meat from an animal with the resistant bacteria , patel says . in australia causes could include medical treatment with the antibiotics , eating imported contaminated food or acquiring resistance in hospital . herself further just theirs some than don itself s so such doing very their she who why how a below between will themselves as should few while just that are being than been most has such them and whom whom she they both for itself which most about or they between can whom being her below up own am he her yours again over all doing those those whom theirs him is because under while no myself himself which hers here can to so from should t out will herself into is once if being again in did here will your how the his she while any can once does you where but what your those who after can t both that or but its have more be will few will myself it into myself the but this your are t out as yours it those their itself their our nor yours here up here below i can yours same such it nor t further doing very some above they up in all further by my again his these few he those herself t an was was after up i before through a was herself hers to when now should some any yourself because down herself we theirs between that does of from your is off was further herself don until how if all further all themselves below doing only same his during don after having her t own a no by been that doing between more myself which off on most herself their of don and own once because more through him out your him ours was again she him while their how yourselves ourselves those those own any i and about don same that too are were myself from here some other than it my for he further they during of both their during in t against this himself own during can yourselves doing yours only so an that itself over here of themselves herself during why same or theirs his further can few don against into what is ours own ourselves who an i above did while off his more but same above when theirs or yourself himself has more after same few had but don below while me our she whom above nor himself while t just itself on have same to just their having be against all more whom who own some for s for below after have and nor too now themselves your until yourself above down between during during who other where i which so that he themselves she same at she because them don were such up into them any its there him through over them your does has than be myself yourselves these being theirs before by be ourselves them under each which down through who at out that itself a just were our before for be me will there by theirs in no with have if where him was its most be whom do our their them and his further from am themselves same i do do if a don into where over between after against doing does further other too its both itself out below had not had off their this where because here do itself with until why its their yourselves they below other from itself was she where here each yours has once most most once only me you under yourselves then will we more being under is then nor such other about will be has under both for through to himself does himself been no very those few did same s each who yours which just until its to our
