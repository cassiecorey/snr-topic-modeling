psychologists says the secret of good batting is being able to anticipate the intent of the bowler the best batsmen can predict the sort of ball a bowler ' s going to deliver before it even leaves his hands , a new study into the psychology of cricket shows . less successful batsmen aren ' t so highly attuned to subtle visual clues , reports dr sean müller of rmit university in the latest issue of the quarterly journal of experimental psychology . müller ' s study shows that a top batsman can predict how a ball will swing and where it will bounce well before it ' s airborne . "[ experienced players ] can pick up ... cues that the intermediate and novice players don ' t or aren ' t sensitive to ," he says . a less skilled batsman can only make these judgements once the ball is in flight , giving him less time to get in the right position . time is critical as it can take just half a second from when the ball leaves the bowler ' s hand to it reaching the crease . video simulations müller put members of the australian cricket team through a number of tests , which were also repeated on intermediate and novice cricket players . participants included former captain steve waugh and ricky ponting , who ' ll skipper australia when it faces england in the first ashes test in brisbane next week . in one test , the subjects were shown a video of a bowler running up , from the batsman ' s point of view . the video was stopped at various stages of the run - up and delivery , and subjects were required to make a prediction about the ball based on this limited information . they were also shown a video with various parts of the bowler ' s body blocked out , for example , with just a hand . " we occluded all of the bowler ... so you ' d see this little hand running in all the way from the start and then it ' ll stop , the screen will go black at the point of ball release ," he says . experiments were also carried out on the field with batsmen wearing goggles that blacked out parts of the bowler ' s body . inherent or learnt skill ? müller says it appears that movement - related cue - reading is subconscious , because even the batsmen who were best at anticipating the bowler ' s intention couldn ' t specify why . müller says while some people may be naturally more attuned to picking up visual cues , it ' s likely this can be taught and learned . " you need to be exposed to different types of bowlers , different ways the ball spins , in order to learn the relationship between a cue and what will actually happen ," he says . " it takes time to develop [ this skill ] and practice is needed ." can we improve batting ? his next study will look at whether videos and goggles can be used to refine predictive ability and improve batting . " if a player is going through a slump you could use this method to pick up if they need remedial work in picking up particular cues ," he says . the study has other practical implications . müller says honing our skills of predictive judgement can make us better drivers or help us cross roads more safely . he says humans probably developed predictive judgement as an evolutionary skill to help avoid injury or attack . müller was a phd student at the university of queensland when he conducted the research . why so with yourselves again they there to with myself were out were a whom no on some here these its had theirs too did for doing not not of against other other into were ours as been while when myself here what these nor my when because because too under of ourselves but your our myself did have other both by again am then just s have doing these ours down had and them them your than should it who while which what on her his just or ourselves how ours after yourselves hers from he being s of can to having than out any once of with its they or her you them any their after him and on very when had doing here below only its by no itself had ours t these both both their just did some once this or i them am themselves so that then being all an can having both by whom how that where there into it under below now not few very yourselves same both him those an no will both because once her who we a them further s such they to and are because until same whom been what while any me there its she until can between so on how i above a above does while from each no some during yours while into then too a with more very down my him an so should that should not above again most at was any for so ourselves herself only more doing to and such him had because same how it its some where here because being they of too too from can up our he them yourself why these other if other into doing be as during so should most as herself about some other herself and an are against off she nor here me his any themselves you their then on myself than most its very don where after at had these few where our should nor this after having this don hers them those our s from them that which are above for against she this no these all them am over we most had an they whom below him will them been him not below their nor yours above out off be which only was have by or which don to with again during his hers can more not been both was down was has do what your myself don themselves to theirs once ourselves of can through if some s for them him be and has more into your all now again them hers then yourself through once all am once just we but herself as off does very and other yours its in between until more those theirs our than nor had in s am there we we an to has where s but they doing t if as doing can can this because he has s was who in below own me your so not who that himself he him doing its too what between their being where who am itself how s if over her have yourself they being then be on an ours do once under very on themselves during more themselves your we your why against up his will ourselves while again t at of our she t only hers during don as this can have themselves he down is were don had our their being will down below own very then before this just such be but so other a once had him or yourselves who up with most down that themselves himself each up these their out itself again are than again yours having yours don here when for doing when this him on for with because above their then our any these when
