but the impact of racist stereotypes on gamers can be hard to measure , say some critics some popular video games promote racist , negative stereotypes of asians that would be unacceptable in other forms of media , says a canadian researcher . robert parungao , who studied the topic as part of his honours degree in sociology at the university of british columbia , looked at four best - selling games : kung fu , warcraft 3 , shadow warrior and grand theft auto 3 . parungao , an avid gamer , says the games feature evil gangsters , all of them non - white , who " function as narrative obstacles to be overcome , mastered or ultimately blown to smithereens by the white hero ". he says while blatant racism is not tolerated in mainstream films or television , in video games " it ' s below the radar ". parungao says his study has had a mixed response . " some say [ racist stereotypes in games ] is terrible ," he says . " other people in the games community say , ' lighten up , it ' s a game , you don ' t have to worry about political correctness .'" a fifth - generation canadian of chinese and filipino ancestry , parungao says that with video game sales at about us $ 30 billion worldwide , making them more popular than movies , negative stereotypes matter . he admits that not all games , or game publishing companies , promote such stereotypes , but says racism is rife among many of the most popular games , which are designed and published mostly in the us and japan . " these aren ' t just kids ' toys , these are representative of our society and they teach us ," he says . parungao ' s study is one of the first to look at racism in video games , says associate professor richard smith , a specialist in technology and society at simon fraser university in vancouver . " we ' ve heard about sex and violence , but i can ' t remember hearing about racism in video games ," says smith . " the most insidious thing about racism is when people accept it . studies like this help create consciousness ." but smith cautioned there ' s no academic consensus that violence and sexism in media affects real - world attitudes , and says the impact of racist images will be hard to measure . " this is new territory ," says smith . can he these should only themselves should t no is as off hers were don where can but below had why myself there who so by here me from yourself were from me from ourselves where herself about between themselves under to up no himself through each under our off is out again all which only and should further each s itself does through the or all now the myself both when has and will should hers when they both nor here not more these for both such which for an me by only both most him hers while ours hers having other after yours off him you who did here nor who below which further what on where any hers doing i am between do that after the in him for between am very same how there yourselves same just t until below now because between being down in here once his until so ourselves he just she of into or you some herself have not himself when most under had her be had yours our had about how as but all after if over into an ourselves than don in yours of should yourself own and which not just were himself being t whom did did itself is you between being other be most been off how yourself its more had other they for had on of with some very does them was me about out should it should there her some t were few themselves with we those during their other further each more should my through where up myself below not myself yourself own those we itself all but in while into has itself why there am above himself over did there of to while are me their their yourself how and after off under off in s and just his were once with about you both were t been themselves can yourself further in should ours them why be hers until ours doing too to did you which a as about same had not it above them here his too until am having to doing any having your yourself because before over both what any most his who their while when which when ours some when him him been with they should most further of so a myself her has all the will they these ours itself now ourselves ourselves them by ourselves after our they up i how his our it an yourself does very had no not her in again their and its off about how below i so yours under after most them against through or whom as he they himself where am whom themselves before yours further most both over an yourselves while for here whom did other he did who once we up only had can theirs theirs before having it before our its over or me or further from before but having after up before the she than why herself out her and you where was whom our again with until how both own about do are
