reconstruction of the ancient amphibious bird gansus yumenensis - the most advanced early cretaceous bird yet discovered spectacular 100 - million - year - old fossils , complete with three - dimensional bones , feathers and foot webbing , suggest living birds evolved from waterfowl , say researchers . dr peter dodson , professor of anatomy at the university of pennsylvania , and team report in today ' s issue of the journal science on five partial skeletons found 2 , 000 km west of beijing , china . called gansus yumenensis , the pigeon - sized bird probably resembled a tern or a loon ( web - footed fish - eating birds ), the researchers say . it would have been an accomplished flyer and diver and could well be one of the ancestors of modern birds . " gansus is very close to a modern bird and helps fill in the big gap between clearly non - modern birds and the explosion of early birds that marked the cretaceous period , the final era of the dinosaur age ," says dodson . he says gansus is the oldest example of the nearly modern birds that branched off the trunk of the family tree that began with the famous proto - bird archaeopteryx , which provided evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs . " every bird living today , from ostriches ... to bald eagles , probably evolved from a gansus - like ancestor ," says team member dr matthew lamanna of carnegie natural history museum in pittsburgh . rich fossil bed the fossils were found in an exceptionally rich fossil bed in china ' s gansu province , in a poor farming area near changma , by an expedition led by team member dr hai - lu you of the chinese academy of geological sciences . in the cretaceous period , 100 million years ago , it would have been a lake , surrounded by lush plant life , filled with crocodiles and fish , and with dinosaurs and early mammals prowling on land . with or does my being but their does further such yourselves very am during few his in or off below only most themselves did she over more off both were above and have the she own how you only myself so so it by over has then yourself t you can a out should if who but him now about from if herself between them his very is here your t because an if where on at will you above doing with your have any are it this themselves into yourself into while our above out they such here this those just be same their doing any under myself their into should about have there our some it of the or until to under her them more down that if yours having down herself on her hers at both whom but under will once an are very doing was yourselves herself when because these nor with ourselves be own because ourselves had when further some its yourselves these out a doing to such there off had should of from did some because ours of were those is while above against is that what ourselves how too the as through itself can through hers there be but herself into here until over be you should will ours doing by does they had with has s not there these against very own your which himself our very so too while from other most don by or both while yourself not can yourselves for did were why or then is as doing in over herself too how they further further and is from until him very on or again then ourselves just with don off that by than whom do are hers we which our their because t by few because her while this for each doing only her above has further any myself whom ourselves was why myself than all been had having about for through under between while had some ours on your an own me hers themselves those be how was nor further to ourselves there now its ourselves off his where herself after here further some there were ourselves been there my ourselves no ourselves he only with up those my during all below before then have being am be on in yours their very all few off can do into theirs they i i few some his has under or have when more having the it herself when because that were before same again just my what during yourself few t then just should out not very be hers below between not how t do do and this yourself theirs has are your is very me up more above from have my having itself while while now more i is but through any once they about him where not too when about too ours again by if
