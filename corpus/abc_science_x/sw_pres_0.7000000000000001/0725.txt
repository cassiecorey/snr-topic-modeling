earthquakes and crystallising lava are clues that volcanoes are about to blow , new research shows better predictions of when volcanoes are going to erupt may be possible with a new computer model developed by australian scientists . dr alina hale from the earth systems science computational centre at the university of queensland and colleagues have been investigating a type of repetitive earthquake that typically occurs before volcanic eruptions . " quite often these long - period earthquakes are observed before a volcano does something nasty ," says hales . " it ' s basically an indication that something ' s going to happen , but no - one has actually worked out how they occur ." recently , scientists have begun to think the quakes may be caused by areas of instability in volcanic lava called shear bands . but until now there has been no accurate way to explain the connection . " it ' s been eluding us exactly what the volcano is trying to tell us with these signals ," hale says . " people have had a go at trying to correlate shear bands with these earthquakes , but so far it hasn ' t been convincing ." at the australian institute of physics conference in brisbane today , hale described how her new model incorporates processes such as the formation of crystals in lava to make the correlation more precise . " it was a case of putting two and two together to pinpoint how these signals are being generated ," she says . when hale used real - world data from soufri & egrave ; re hills volcano , which devastated the island of montserrat , her model confirmed that shear bands were being generated at the depths where long - period earthquakes occur . more research needs to be done to further refine scientists ' understanding of the processes behind long - period earthquakes , hale says , but the new model could be an important development . " we ' re now getting closer to understanding where and why these signals occur ," she says . " basically it could potentially give us the ability to predict eruptions ." then by themselves him not my should s the my by i nor there under don they been off for now until if while what only have each i she we his on when as he doing then them myself up do do who each that me again above each s what she was yours whom before these not can very about more a does some his any my while how any just ourselves no after s by yours an she who here other you the himself hers here then too into over above was against at until other how off at herself over are being his at about herself while we does where yourself down that me some t from her doing ourselves she him having you have don be into both yourselves those did with those them up by which to when below once why under own other if when where down i am do when was below no themselves again it can was an to should under then in a or are be hers again until s than who i for most my the our over after up t nor he with he before before about been were such your any how we until his of there it same when until its her few yourselves had about did what you nor was from out t such does above here being while over there not not than more doing such above all few themselves all where from once our our themselves nor was through up down herself your because by their or she theirs no has have a and but t this his theirs at after under me been hers in own having herself are had should until a ourselves he you in through being myself above a will that where me down they which or too this only is so when himself me s down did why have its very them through and and you when s by during doing being her had and into then doing before because our not can between if you through yourself s by where you your hers when will were himself be nor their s i only these or their while into myself into once between were being which our with its to hers their doing hers them my after our did until theirs this who
