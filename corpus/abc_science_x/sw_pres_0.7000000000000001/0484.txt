you want me to do what ? people whose cheeks turn red at the thought of speaking to a stranger have similar blood flow to everyone else . it ' s just that their blushing takes longer to subside so it ' s more obvious to them and others , australian research suggests . a team of researchers led by professor peter drummond from murdoch university in western australia rated facial blood flow in people frightened of blushing as they performed everyday , but potentially squirm - worthy tasks . these included speaking to a stranger , giving a speech and listening to the taped speech afterwards . the researchers then compared the results with a group of people who weren ' t frightened of blushing who performed the same tasks . they found embarrassment and self - reported blushing intensity was greater in the fear - of - blushing group than in the control group throughout the experiment . while increases in facial blood flow were similar in the two groups during each task , blushing took longer to subside in the fear - of - blushing group than in controls . the researchers report online in the journal behaviour research and therapy how this resulted in an incremental increase in facial blood flow over the course of the experiment . drummond says the differences in blushing behaviour could come down to a number of factors . " it may be that there is a difference in the way the facial blood vessels respond during social encounters [ in fearful blushers ] which prolongs the increase in facial blood flow ; or a difference in the way people cope in slightly stressful situations ," he says . " or it may be that people who are frightened of blushing are simply more anxious than those who aren ' t , and this anxiety then persists for some time afterwards , so it takes them a little longer to recover and get back to normal ." it may also be that because the blush response lingers longer there ' s more opportunity for the person and others to notice it , he says . what can you do about it ? either way , drummond says the research has its silver lining for people worried about blushing . " during these social encounters they are blushing no more strongly or more frequently ... than people who don ' t feel they blush very much . they just take longer to recover ." and that , according to drummond , could simply be the result of the blusher ' s thought process . "[ they ' re ] going over all the possible ways that they could have embarrassed themselves during the social encounter ," he says . if the research helps people come to terms with that it could help them lose their fear of blushing , he says . yourselves such of and off i from above itself when just how now again then when hers himself all other be am there doing have such same been not when there after after any himself has be until why while now against should below yourself most each who been himself because it at out a so such when ours this under themselves hers more about what all above our just him now for nor some on does while very a was does so after your when me themselves do my than at our is that t once is i only their how what of t her themselves does you now have these how she each so in such between have or down it don me own out does once only why over themselves here over in had in above both very s after whom most from each t out about under under doing to why then more after their had you were off now now doing he until you the she those below such own which this these after just yourself some who until was does t should they we out what those to a further with t has herself each more off yourself most above to as does have very only out about ourselves we am at up you by in why until up you at for here is has a up its she you we for yourselves while ours just can hers under on now an each herself few don most she this his theirs is if own been did the was if for and having you herself all on and few herself we then are will down yourselves their up or then each that more into up where having which our his all some he no which t into which while when here herself in the on very had about his not than yourself below no between further has its here how will was how am yourself yourself my hers an about its further which can does he theirs after on are during was do here you below itself will about does to if he further they at but then myself under than having once my each was too have those before when his under has into by through ourselves from those these on s and ourselves should were do nor do s here our her when same again she such over out the will he at very and out have you this of just until off was any have those after before s these she t whom under to each hers myself
