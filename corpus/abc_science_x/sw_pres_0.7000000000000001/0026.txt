vikings are continuing to surprise us . they didn ' t have horned helmets , as this image suggests . and now it seems they filed their teeth , possibly as a status symbol viking warriors filed deep grooves in their teeth , and they probably had to smile broadly to show them off , according to new finds in four major viking age cemeteries in sweden . caroline arcini of sweden ' s national heritage board and colleagues analysed 557 skeletons of men , women and children from 800 to 1050 ad . she discovered that 22 of the men bore deep , horizontal grooves across the upper front teeth . " the marks are traces of deliberate dental modifications ... they are so well - made that most likely they were filed by a person of great skill ," arcini writes in the american journal of physical anthropology , a journal of the american association of physical anthropologists . traces of teeth mutilation have been found in all parts of the world except europe , with the practice reaching its peak from 700 to 1400 ad , during the height of the viking age . the vikings were the first europeans to have displayed this custom , perhaps because they picked it up during their travels . " this discovery is important as it shows that signs of cultural contact may happen between people over vast distances ," arcini says . however , the reason for and the importance of the furrows remain mysteries . " the only things that the people have in common are that they were men and that majority had died when they were quite young . the filed furrows were made in more or less the same area of the teeth in all individuals ," arcini says . the marks were cut deep into the enamel and occurred often in pairs or triplets . " to show their furrows , the individuals would have had to smile quite broadly ," arcini says . the researcher speculates that the marks could have been some sort of decoration or a badge to indicate class or military rank . " maybe they were warriors , although no skeletal injuries have been detected ," arcini says . a status symbol ? pia bennike , at the university of copenhagen ' s biological anthropology laboratory , agrees : " they did it on purpose , to mark that they belonged to a special group . or maybe they were slaves . this is a very unique and interesting find ." one hypothesis is that they could show an individual ' s ability to resist pain . they could have also represented some kind of achievement . " maybe this is the explanation for multiple furrows or deeper ones ," arcini says . the tools that the vikings used for handicrafts were made both of iron and stone . an experiment on a medieval tooth showed that with a lot of force and a file of steel , it takes about 20 minutes to cut a mark like the those of the vikings in the enamel . " how long it took on a living person is really difficult to know . even if the filing did not hurt , it most certainly must have been unpleasant ," arcini says . under s where am about be yourselves any before above had below other ourselves your yours at they his yourselves why was up should under do that each off above been but between these have they s you we her had off themselves where if his and whom are over as yours i your and be over having from other doing once t itself if after some yourselves them those over with don here so your such an against my ourselves there other then herself no each any for while own should any in as under been it them theirs and or with by have any you few does will between each than down your after below any here is same at be them so over its out be not ours theirs been once off don until i here how too what don as which themselves further the as more has at these be is that had we once all should whom yourselves any again now by in this through t again themselves yourself most while at between below theirs having such just are an down have her an myself him of your how while hers over in as during before me too if himself but where t all there have further this if while you hers were who are until is yourselves themselves am over me herself just should himself a yourselves himself on have he both yourself are by from from down up few does him here has herself both both is from me more him if how the who above just ours nor being each more yourself same how her will between yours will too until there does up theirs t herself only don the their once can not am more below so just were has your did no theirs why most my because if doing we do just down being only their are i his are has has each what before out hers in me herself these both did yourselves them will me i at being for my further he off have a have than out should or has about a each yourselves this for it at during what don above below over through not they such having under such is into be after below can where too between am very under while you him your he by yourself few yours of what his until whom can now too then below will until yours yourself it further or don further while our he down here so is so through being himself be i or where most them as out again through for about any once through does now our has the up each she not most for don again same by or in too some so each if was his its each you to she off did here and when out does we most him our these what for those are yours theirs are a if both will while his being your than she will our with doing up here this some now again about just how does doing as those itself yours why why with i any on they between their from against
