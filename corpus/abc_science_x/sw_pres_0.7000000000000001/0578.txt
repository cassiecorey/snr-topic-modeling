one day you might be greeted by a talking , thinking computer - animated face like this one when booking a ticket , or withdrawing money from the bank talking , thinking cartoon faces that understand our needs may one day improve our chances of getting what we want from computers , say experts . the animated faces may replace the mouse , keyboard and the touch screen as the main way we interact with computers , say when booking tickets or withdrawing money from the bank . professor denis burnham , director of the marcs auditory laboratories at the university of western sydney , says a talking , thinking head could be available in the next 10 years . " at the moment we use keyboards and mouses [ to communicate ]," says burnham , a behavioural psychologist . "[ but ] what people really want with computers is that they actually understand what you ' re doing and know what you want and can interact with you a lot more effectively and naturally ." burnham is heading up a new a $ 3 . 4 million ( us $ 2 . 5 million ) project , funded by the australian research council and the national health and medical research council , to develop a computer - generated head that emulates face - to - face conversation . burnham ' s team will use technologies such as computer animation , speech recognition and computer - generated dialogue to construct the talking , thinking head . and the researchers will use cognitive science to evaluate and improve how well it communicates . frustrated ? from the word processor ' s irritating ' paper clip man ' to frustrating telephone automated directory services , success so far in this arena has been somewhat limited . burnham hopes his team ' s talking , thinking head will make our conversations with artifically intelligent machines more effective for two reasons . first , it will include visual cues , such as different mouth shapes and face expressions that help us understand what is being said . second , the head will be capable of tailoring its communication to different types of people , by accessing different databases . it would select articulation , intonation , facial expression or vocabulary to best suit the person it ' s talking to , says burnham . he says such a head on a videophone could make automated directory assistance more effective at communicating with children , or people with accents or hearing disabilities . it might also remember different individuals and personalise its interactions with them , and have appropriate emotional responses when the need arises , burnham says . the head might even " switch to sympathetic mode " when we get irate with it for not understanding us correctly . learning all the time burnham says he plans to develop a head that is also able to learn from its interactions with different people and improve its communication . he says current prototype heads are used in tourist information kiosks , for ticketing and language instruction . one project is also exploring the use of a talking , thinking head as a personal companion and minder for elderly or disabled people . burnham says the project will initially explore two scenarios where the head might be useful : dealing with billing complaints and language tuition . between further between should for which this these those if their will from down whom this once his after only other
