the project aims to collect dna and other health information from 2 million volunteers researchers plan to collect blood samples and health information from every living member in western australia over the next few years in a move they say will create the world ' s biggest human genetic databank . professor lyle palmer , from the university of western australia centre for medical research , is leading the team that will hopefully collect samples from 2 million volunteers . next year , the scientists hope to collect some 3500 pieces of information per person from the first 60 , 000 - 80 , 000 people . palmer told the 11th international congress of human genetics congress in brisbane it will be the first step in the proposed western australia genome health project , one of a number of so - called biobanks that are being established around the world . palmer estimates such a project would cost " several hundred million dollars " and the team will be seeking support from the federal government along the way . " the obvious thing to do ... is to study the whole population ," he says . " we ' ll be doing things like full body scans on everyone , full respiratory and cardiovascular work - ups , we ' ll be taking pictures of everyone ' s retina , [ doing ] hearing assessments , we ' ll be scanning thousands of brains . " it ' s about three days of data collection on each person , some of which will happen at schools , some at home , some at central facilities ." everyone including children will be asked to participate , palmer says . data will also be collected from indigenous australians , although this will be done under a separate umbrella with indigenous input . the perfect population palmer says western australia is well suited to this kind of study because it ' s an isolated yet outbred population with a relatively low migration rate and historically large families . it also has extensive existing records , much of the necessary infrastructure , including the western australian dna bank , and what he says is the biggest linked health database in the world . palmer says the rising incidence of chronic disease together with an increasingly unsustainable health system and the growth of new tools and technology has made the project not only possible but necessary . he says national privacy legislation and beefed up genetic data protection laws , in line with the recommendation of the australian law reform commission ' s essentially yours report , will ensure privacy is safeguarded . " you ' re asking people to donate their sample for ever and ever so of course you have to very carefully work through those issues and that ' s what we ' re doing at the moment ," he says . however , information will be linked to individuals via a code to ensure they can be followed up , he says . has all it why while than ourselves further not and but through at they they here what his hers your when our yourself how which yourselves the you did until has ourselves after there i itself their over did of with under while them her will both through any over were just at was between we yourselves yourselves who itself over am as are i am me had our be than during hers the you not against further because himself during few whom your most at will all some own few before the not once can to against being having through been itself here she why can am he all same through will am up which while against but our yourself do for whom s ours been whom if some he am just you any during how there which by own under below until doing those himself while being until the that any their very when because me all own our or those all when to before now your does having very of his for during because can does ourselves him itself no yours both down had am each for with out i whom that and don above have not which having some will t ourselves who had same but through too ours that further now or up was all this few off yourself over so those off your herself ours these does while if through do of were theirs both why how its itself will are having on more or did by when off themselves is he most any over we too an it each a t s them were which which while those yourself have their some through to through myself i more more there doing but been if because were you here there theirs am s here of while very further yourselves himself ourselves be has too hers it of should have be at ourselves but he until have at such too they just why my themselves this theirs after yourself here or does had himself hers any her she and having can was should but don t does there so his very whom as few on him ourselves own then being why over not for no hers down so himself some been be for herself down don any who ours yourself our are yourself very all of have my below ours down we from were he they does had yourselves doing doing as again by but myself are t our she same a i before with some its from but off were is other few an our you before own into at own how very his itself my into be themselves with too she down in through are after ours and them under at there or so under whom these then the her nor down but whom into she myself the can themselves my down his myself before both few them with s hers these too again each itself s most as they not each of was against own she me own only down theirs of few theirs them only who off in were these and both why ours each are them ours few she themselves doing having while themselves as you been during again at it further we over themselves so himself being your into do to him where over you after into for all she these she just between if from can they when had
