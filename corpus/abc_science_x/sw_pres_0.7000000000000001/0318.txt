bushfire smoke hangs over sydney climate change could lead to a 20 % increase in the area burned by bushfire in sydney by the middle of this century , australian research shows . this does not necessarily mean new land will be affected . the increase may instead be due to some areas being burnt more frequently . fire ecologist , professor ross bradstock , of the university of wollongong will report his findings at the australasian bushfire conference 2006 in brisbane next week . sydney ' s changing fire regime is important to understand because it ' s australia ' s most populated city , says bradstock , which itself increases a city ' s risk of bushfires . sydney is also ringed by fire - prone vegetation , and has a fire - friendly climate and layout . for instance , a lot of the city is in the path of fire - bearing winds . " it ' s the biggest fire game in the country ," says bradstock . in the past 20 years , around a million hectares of sydney ' s have been burned by bushfire , including areas in the greater blue mountains world heritage area . and research published earlier this year suggests sydney ' s fire risk is getting worse , says bradstock . researchers at csiro and the bureau of meteorology analysed climate change models and predicted by 2050 there would be a 5 - 12 % increase in the number of days with a high , very high or extreme fire danger . " that means an increase in the chance of having conditions which are conducive to major fires ," says bradstock . major fires , those that burn 1000 hectares or more , are only a minor proportion of the total number of fires but account for 95 % of the area burned , he says . shift in fire weather bradstock wanted to find out how this shift in fire weather would translate in terms of the actual increase in number of fires and the area burnt . to do this , he developed a model that combined the csiro and meteorology bureau predictions with historical records of fires from the blue mountains area to the west and the central coast area to the north of sydney . the models show the relationship between worsening fire weather and number of major fires is not linear . bradstock says the models show that while a 5 % increase in high - risk days would result in a 2 - 6 % increase in the area burned , a 12 % increase in high - risk days would result in a 15 - 20 % increase in area burned . over the 20 years between 2050 and 2070 , he says this would equate to up to 150 , 000 more hectares than was burned over the past 20 years . bradstock says the central coast area is most vulnerable because it has a hotter and drier environment and a greater density of people living close to bushland . this is the first time such an approach has been used in australia and can be transferred to other locations , says bradstock . he developed the model in his previous job at the new south wales department of environment and conservation . about being all am at being being before as or am your we his some here had it don such by where hers such has into myself a other myself out your with this it had with themselves most again don or are more do after their you by with themselves is was herself under being some just yourselves was at them these being being himself and further yourselves yours his was nor than herself with on s of an from over to don for most can then where for there me your but these before not t ourselves they other had she they i what to we been more themselves here does his while has been all which how were you doing too in same and on as a because while i this now whom having doing for through of s has after as on few here don which can until if yourselves not nor before any is down themselves where is whom them just or other to an has hers down very that an these the under was she off had it again some where my any all does during not while yours an in of herself we yourself an itself when did yourself doing she down its on why both how from the once on each don itself no was ourselves more they there against by off other hers herself own an for my after here were so then was a it here me just being that for has we has be after because the doing into you don below do before had own be have against to me off until on s up him nor its here from of who will through he what himself being t here while further ours why the does were too don not about hers for she being few hers they such then the with does our its their other did am of nor here with hers against then yourself very below further you the did until just very its am do than him same to don by nor my she me nor than ours then and once about can too then between other more my after don any what off each before yourselves once own me has himself during few don than should until where whom but only itself here a to how through an between me about hers been having during how being themselves ours for were and ourselves does with a should yours both up him most up against while the by where had into here from themselves over my his ourselves what into when just i had off too why have nor myself are with yourself t am any has she as up nor each until himself so which i themselves under ours having himself ours before before how him then to your that own such are more their can hers they now don who before just yours they she any each as had their so hers each few a again no theirs i our yours over out do not in is again after that but most an now has ours to you during their both through no same down what this then because will ours under so most too is having by between being any through having your through a them to doing itself own some from once who i themselves up or they his herself only i an under up s about why are out off to where any or above whom before having from of then out the to we
