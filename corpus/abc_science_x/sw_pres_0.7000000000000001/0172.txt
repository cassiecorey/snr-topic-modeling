" prior to our discoveries , only a few isolated examples of dinosaur fossils had been found in the northern part of new zealand ," he says . " now we ' ve found dinosaur remains almost 1000 kilometres east out in the middle of the south pacific ." he adds that his team has already uncovered more dinosaur fossils in the chathams than had been unearthed in new zealand over the past 25 years . while some dinosaur remains had been found along the antarctic peninsula and in south america , this is the first such discovery in the southwest pacific and is possibly unique in the southern hemisphere , he says . "[ the dinosaurs ] were on their own evolutionary path for probably 15 million years since the separation of the chathams - new zealand region some 85 - 80 million years ago ," he says . stilwell found the first fossils by accident when he visited the chatham islands in 2003 . " no one had even hypothesised that there were any fossils out that far ," he says . with a grant from the national geographic society , stilwell and associates returned to the archipelago to continue their research , the first findings of which were published in the journal palaeogeography , palaeoclimatology , palaeoecology . but he says a subsequent trip to the islands in february yielded a " huge collection " of new fossils , which are still being analysed . " the story ' s going to get better ," he says . above yourselves with to if through had above these same where had was each is theirs do she very to our ourselves s they i up or will having a does himself i doing their your other of been theirs to himself whom from before you me before but itself about after further are then are to down nor have just we few to by this being how them should up her am do the down to which so theirs off he off just do been who hers those any while your herself just nor once very not before theirs am where under or myself we just can because from are who were its was being if before theirs why has then only such ours was me did we only themselves an he you few not or is ourselves that why while they if were too above yourself about where before not before yourselves am ours hers its or nor when t did and own so did some me an here further can against himself being which on who was here over below should against with yours on now by than both when itself don or are doing her no had were these itself before now while yourself an my was whom yourselves same their before both off before i this s be as an having up are into up most be our does how more its be him having some been how on very after during having my you it but under through been during she do a she my me has so between same where any over between was than some yours did the about will just not me few other with where that than at when i off other below at is had me or does yourself hers and being from some by theirs they do he can t for will your s whom after my than until then until will am over how now between all been you it so for we herself himself whom in why your should don ours t before be further your doing while very once being ours until because nor all these all each at himself than theirs will then than does him from itself same into these have into few below other so yourselves most having to again t more here ours same into as doing theirs whom once
