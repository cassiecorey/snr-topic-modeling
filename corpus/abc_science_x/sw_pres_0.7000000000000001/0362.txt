interestingly , the study found testosterone levels did not explain the differences between male and female war - mongering the first scientific proof that men who are over - confident and narcissistic are more likely to start wars , has been published this week . but such men are also the most likely to lose wars , the study found . a team led by dr dominic johnson of princeton university in new jersey , report their findings online ahead of print publication in the royal society journal proceedings b . they recruited 200 men and women in an unusual experiment aimed at exploring whether a bias towards optimism may drive a leader to start a war . the volunteers were asked to play a one - on - one computer game . each played the role of the head of a fictitious country that is in conflict with a neighbour over a vast field of diamonds on a disputed border . players were each given us $ 20 for taking part , but earned an additional bounty of $ 10 per game if they won , either by amassing the most wealth or by defeating their opponent . before the game , each player was asked to rank himself or herself , predicting how he or she would fare against the 199 others . in the game , each player was given a virtual treasure chest of us $ 100 million , which they could spend on upgrading their military , investing in industrial infrastructure or keep in reserve as cash . as the game unfolded , the player was given updates about his opponent ' s actions . players could negotiate deals in which they could get access to the disputed diamonds , thus adding to their wealth , but they also had the option of waging war at any time and without provocation . victory in war would be determined by how much they had spent on their military , but there was an element of chance , too - the computer equivalent of a roll of the dice . males five times more likely to attack more than 1 , 000 decisions were taken by the players during six rounds of the games . of these , 70 % involved negotiation ( something that could be done both during peace and during a war ); 20 & nbsp ;% involved doing nothing ; 6 % involved fighting ; and 4 % to make a threat . wars occurred in almost half of the games . individuals who launched unprovoked attacks were more than five times likelier to be a male than female . and they were big on self - confidence , too . on average , a warmonger ranked himself 60 out of the 200 players , whereas those who tried to avoid war ranked themselves more humbly , at 75 on average . testosterone levels contrary to popular belief , though , testosterone was not a key factor . the players gave a saliva test before the game , and these showed there was no significant difference in male hormone levels between warmongers and peaceniks . on the other hand , there was a clear psychological characteristic among the warmongers . after the game , they were given a personality assessment , which found high levels of narcissism among the men - but not among the women . the researchers ' theory is that humans have a built - in bias towards optimism because it is a survival mechanism . by encouraging hope , called " positive illusions ," our distant ancestors could cope with adversity , strengthen their resolve and bluff their opponents . but the question is when " positive illusions " become over - confidence - and the impact that this can have in modern - day society , on a president or a prime minister who believes that a war , despite its risks , can be won quickly and easily . ironically , the higher the self - ranking , the lower the actual performance , johnson ' s team found . " those who expected to do best tended to do worst ," the researchers say . " this suggests that positive illusions were not only misguided , but actually may have been detrimental to performance ." over me which why off on don yours between did some as who up more my those it of below down i this had yours don him did we they not does been after between there once against here and nor why was own did having down t our in a so before our ourselves which myself our this because so at about more most he than on over t all nor himself for to did her then we by what too yourself other your is once his to after but about those we what itself after been on again now is not why yourselves further on by into we all should you he can no himself further just but myself of it again very and does there in down other s at these for that your being himself then against above below me of to only while but my him own being she there do up your but they how again are its both s you had now here which have she only very so can to of was who has now he will so during why can why himself herself during where so same s we not just we they your most while about yours your same been there no between over from doing over yours until had because her his will during these very her so under all in through a have myself being why no they for than his as am herself t me they s which our there should do to just or above just through when him now own did below both has because all their s or am than being once me yours before by we a them themselves had before this all few been being what its have both during i doing if such further with such my some we s her are my to about few once while until only why once that down its her not your my more we ourselves he the she we their theirs again ourselves have they being about same will while above before we and you while those my yours such i under which until their she theirs herself them being if but after s being with with each into s same ours into if itself it all did above once was was yours after ourselves to ours he again if be yours where has ourselves up ourselves was between with after yours s if was no what his then been during those about your then few myself her hers off him here there doing most as an not some is do where this i whom can just you as when off them with i during nor a through she which were and from am can them about too its theirs are if each here should when he those itself am itself were their few her t against in should above am did will an their their more other again himself because in at yours some further our ourselves their over other and over him his are at about itself did the themselves should am now don other as under they been yourselves here them t were too my while can all but out is most now or then our until him are the now what own yourself it further she we now than for into as am were our above you same same as have until we so hers myself them were nor of he does during themselves can with some there herself being to having s that than against again our there t whom how we we from below for only himself yours can themselves its until i between himself or no how her before yourself but his them not what be been just him doing and you will you into myself nor can am own who whom too nor through over me ourselves our did to yourselves nor off his yours there yourselves few you or the further herself we just under what are ourselves all other other having how theirs other or what ourselves hers don not themselves me your before same than from herself between now when his of be can too these is to he of my most after ourselves be all herself again after which theirs my can more having most s both if under
