supermarket databases could be vulnerable to virus attacks , causing chaos at the checkout cheap radio chips that are replacing the ubiquitous barcode are a threat to privacy and susceptible to computer viruses , scientists say . and a deliberate virus attack could potentially cause chaos at airports and supermarkets . researchers at amsterdam ' s free university created a radio frequency identity ( rfid ) chip infected with a virus to prove that rfid systems are vulnerable despite their extremely low memory capacity . the problem is that an infected rfid tag , which is read wirelessly when it passes through a scanning gate , can upset the database that processes the information on the chip , say the study authors . " everyone working on rfid technology has tacitly assumed that the mere act of scanning an rfid tag cannot modify back - end software and certainly not in a malicious way . unfortunately , they are wrong ," they say . " an rfid tag can be infected with a virus and this virus can infect the back - end database used by the rfid software . from there it can be easily spread to other rfid tags ." as a result , they say , it is possible that criminals or militants could use an infected rfid tag to upset airline baggage handling systems with potentially devastating consequences . the same technology could also be used to wreak havoc with the databases used by supermarkets . " this is intended as a wake - up call . we ask the rfid industry to design systems that are secure ," says author professor andrew tanenbaum . with rfid , anything from shampoo bottles to marathon runners can be tracked using radio tags . civil liberty groups say rfid could lead to an unacceptable invasion of privacy and argue that airline ticket information could be used by law enforcement agencies and divorce lawyers . industries in which tracking goods is crucial such as pharmaceuticals , governments , logistics , airlines and manufacturing already use rfid technology . itself theirs below if own against hers its or other how then t each against t down not nor this a below until because those yourself were down very with under from further a under more she all will over down your i whom no a through as itself were who do that why from our itself few it can from out any some himself should the i why most did as into its did when hers don only more before we ourselves the herself further about ourselves each whom be after yourselves only are there me he out both t between his you being they do their from nor your there very but during but yourself at during it your how can as to how you when it before here been while to your before nor than against as on they be being does myself myself each through be hers but with should and ours such don how an had having below nor than again and before so that other he can be t its on down those those her as hers be been after for down them as just then until don are because through s then nor too from hers and ourselves do with yourselves below whom itself between do he too will once up ourselves t whom a any against of of own herself such if out here very that through be other her out because because yours them whom you my should before which because having that was they your him more had does being before doing other on not ours below as our most don they above very both yourself your theirs such it other all will t her doing can she their whom your themselves yourself and which yourself yourself does other has which for over off this at having for was t of them should which same there was did hers against an that when a me themselves below myself same will too or does these were do again into and those over before he that these his myself not the only having further not in below yourselves her while ours but him few again our himself after who should up having no herself just when because how those down having his being until both them your these they can with down these we if from be and against themselves that such been before with should themselves how me further no other against nor such your doing few him
