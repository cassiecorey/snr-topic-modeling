australia ' s free trade deal with the us may mean nanotherapies may be rushed through tests for safety , efficacy and quality , one critic says . but not everyone agrees australia may be forced to rush through inadequately tested and unsafe medical nanotherapies because of its free trade agreement with the us , a health technology regulation expert says . dr thomas faunce , a senior lecturer at the australian national university college of law and medical school , says australia is obliged under the free trade agreement ( fta ) to make innovative pharmaceutical products more readily available . drugs and medical devices using nanotechnology could fall under this banner , he says . faunce , who presented his concerns at the australian health and medical research congress in melbourne today , says as a result of the fta , the therapeutic goods administration ( tga ) may come under pressure to rush trials of new nanotherapies , particulary during preliminary safety , efficacy and quality testing . " the main concern is that the fta puts obligations on the tga to initiate a discussion [ with us authorities ] about fast tracking innovative medical products ," he says . " it ' s not quite sure exactly what that means but the concern is that we ' re still in a situation where it hasn ' t been definitively established that nanotechnology is safe ." nanotechnology involves using extremely small particles on the scale of one billionth of a metre . in medicine , it could be used to create tiny ' machines ' that are introduced into our bodies to deliver medicine , diagnose disease or even fight cancer cell by cell . but because the technology is so new there are concerns about its safety , faunce says . this is because the minute size of the particles means they could evade our normal respiratory and immune defences to enter the lungs or even penetrate our skin . there are fears that once in our bodies , nanoparticles could enter our circulatory and nervous systems , potentially becoming lodged in organs including the lungs and brain . " major concern with this unprecedented research and development is that engineered nanoparticles may present unique health risks when used in medical applications ," faunce says . " they are highly reactive and mobile within the human body and there are currently no effective methods to monitor exposure risks ." is this a problem ? monash university ' s professor brian priestly , director of the australian centre for human health risk assessment , says it ' s probably true that developments in nanotechnology are happening too fast for the regulators to keep up with them . " but that ' s not to say that it ' s being ignored ," says priestly , who has worked with the tga in the past . " i know that the tga looks very carefully at all sorts of innovative technologies so they ' ll certainly be looking at any developments in anotechnology ." a tga spokesperson says rigorous testing is required for all new drug products and nanotherapies are no exception . " extensive , non - clinical , toxicological and clinical safety testing is required for all new drug products ," the spokesperson says . " no concessions or reductions in these requirements will apply to nanomaterials in therapeutic products ." the federal government is currently considering the need for a distinct nanotechnology regulatory body and is expected to release a national nanotechnology strategy in coming months . s down other few my been when about a was your that same from my the at your about on the not was which each as the very have you these do than been as i our its has than who own most why who so can they such if can is from above be for your not its t again after had during does do again from during to with below be their me being the most do than then own on own before for then him so itself from himself too do few yourself out their down but against during below during a above if between our having such theirs before those his once is so how is are his until she should after if he each them with himself by who how can over don not do doing nor yours you them that because so does which before those such out the most when up their now am or to very off out being they just are being does not against under if her am out few just so who myself does is itself when that being down the she own above of doing through out now during were than its by very its am through was an has was itself more who so than will have very their his myself who down all who has there he was there themselves by was t below yourself but each same there under before some its had then itself just so myself under an such his my has out its through some our those whom over don because and before once each their until was been as after here will its but what ours a why too off their of of ourselves should during has nor to those had t not what about him where each herself over just now who then their she ours have nor you they during into has very yourselves any out was herself our into those ours by you itself as this off had more they her what which during you my what ourselves it themselves that his each both me some why doing doing there was again her between some again on own that most between our who your above into some the other i how some other in this those that below hers she who do its who has all why a only had she here me do why once having don doing after there more between this after them when had but than no doing themselves such doing very not him just own his that itself your your down by those if of do and out about during between them yourself until it being ourselves as very to how hers of yourself than its should there about whom is had has just doing ourselves himself were his any theirs where until to the as from into doing himself as those from herself how ours having any some both too being any so yours had in on our same for the just those am some s s some am before it have he them then each again until been such further other she yourselves s any too most being he after but no now more no having was below while those each each did t hers did theirs ourselves if during i the own only the him me what out i theirs any not this from until its through my yourself my once if at which from being herself can am when we herself again off how above than nor we were hers such a hers his before not had have from in their he here more for theirs if our because did once your an be by have after am down an whom who those its this up so how over between after it can they have against most such hers him these s so just their doing very where its again but your while from both they during down her should after our both
