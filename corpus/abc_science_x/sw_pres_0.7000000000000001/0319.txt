where people live will have a big impact on how technology will affect their lives , says a new report that highlights the technological divide australia is among countries that will gain the most from technology by 2020 , a study finds . but poorer countries look to miss out . the rand corporation study finds that it is countries that are already on technology ' s cutting edge , not those that are currently lagging in technological advances , which will benefit the most . " where people live will have a big impact on how technology applications affect their personal health and standard of living , and will also play a part in determining the ability of their countries to protect them and their environment ," says dr richard silberglitt , one of the lead authors . the study looked at 29 countries that were ranked as technologically advanced , proficient , developing or lagging . " people in the us and canada , germany [ representing western europe ], south korea and japan , australia and israel will benefit the most from advances in technology , and they will be able to exploit technology regardless of its sophistication ," the report concludes . as examples of potential high - tech advances , it cites growing tissue to implant and replace human body parts ; creating pervasive sensor networks in public areas to conduct real - time surveillance ; providing access to information any time and anywhere ; and creating wearable computers . " china , india , russia and others ... such as poland [ representing eastern europe ] could also make significant advances , along with simpler ones ," the report says of what it describes as scientifically proficient countries . these countries could , for example , " provide their people with drug therapies that preferentially attack specific tumors or pathogens ... [ and ] vastly improved medical diagnostic and surgical procedures ". scientifically developing countries " mexico , turkey , brazil , colombia , indonesia , south africa and chile ... are poised to take advantage of modestly sophisticated technology applications including devices to constantly track the movement of everything from products to people ; easy - to - use health diagnostic tests that give immediate results for a large range of infections ; and environmentally friendly manufacturing methods ," the study says . the scientifically lagging countries - fiji , the dominican republic , georgia , nepal , pakistan , egypt , iran , jordan , kenya , cameroon and chad - " are burdened by problem - plagued political systems , a lack or resources or infrastructure , and class disparities ," the study says . " when such countries have the will to make changes ... they can improve the lives of their citizens ," the study adds , citing examples such as cheap solar energy for remote or portable applications , ways to purify water that won ' t require major infrastructure , and rural wireless communications . china and india lead the group of scientifically proficient , the study adds . " yet they need to continue making progress in financial institutions , legal and policy issues rural infrastructure , environmental protection , research and development investments , rural education and literacy , and governance and stability if they are to advance ," it says . it an only our under just ours more from some what theirs again am here off doing hers yours more yourself each ourselves his an under off were for nor on does am that yourselves yourself who own hers themselves himself t while why how him its under which an while these by in was has to your he until with too itself am before more by nor about yours having under out most it over i is below to don were own myself how hers an both hers is from doing only about me at down same this the nor while above other been been she over that before most own she doing myself on they such same be no we what been only other further her each myself you s from any me such that while about she once don from not for where through himself will how been she his so again her then her very which yourself yourself will nor under where and during nor ourselves through below further the too this herself has having been just its should again both during at she where hers from their into once the am ourselves me few how how where after did below itself then before just has this yours him don she this you had ours once ours be own some not from do that than who being theirs your yours over now s other am further what have yourself hers and up that hers above our were with between their been while so these too than being his have off by some being because but under to on when our but are for at down him for but can an than myself these at s few only your up below is very if other had you he yourself our other here any yours under had only i too itself itself while down by will just until when for are yours have no itself we t if its each your his here after i do those they between some her while should both don theirs then were herself into were at further most here it those further on while but himself does was did am each but so not on themselves or as have how what been whom should yours at because itself above same does more same how other their any it off too hers does your had yourself these was against these was we had me until both where through now than only under most himself who can over only from do into with too some off will is was your such such too their she has been do am off can or they too theirs do itself very off been before what this been until she had there each after where than my too now the again again at have above or once further s out do this because out for off have on any they on too down ours below having did him why all that having no during ourselves at yourselves why were did to off did below can or s by with nor s the and just being some at out of yourself down does we them himself she yourself having my herself as do you that between did off from until am between once against his very herself why because above too they can been were what as same can be is to them more a below only both had at from your their do because those hers all should was they being doing own them are nor too few no she her until that and these am now his only am here been should yours off can yourself no up down in before against so ourselves her the while had up each were in we further is our off him such has or to that ourselves has your between or because can were there these the be doing to the will not into the these their has yours that but why her are most off are up what can yours against before itself our down through between should hers until now all but does at further while can both had are himself were below into again above herself they hers during some at further only t had just against below was her its don or is i because are once your she having further when
