we may soon be getting weather reports from mars without sending probes into space . and scientists say an old way of gathering data may do the trick astronomers have shown that an old technique for mapping the topography of mars from earth could be used in a novel way to map the red planet ' s weather . the thin atmosphere on mars consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide . and before spacecraft images revealed the planet ' s surface features , astronomers tried to use variations in the density of carbon dioxide to map the topography , with mixed results . now preliminary ground - based images of mars taken in the near infrared region of the spectrum , which is most sensitive to carbon dioxide , have revealed interesting surface features . these show remarkable agreement with the accurate topographical data obtained from the mars orbiting laser altimeter aboard the mars global surveyor . the density of carbon dioxide also indicates the atmospheric pressure at the surface , which is subject to huge seasonal variation as carbon dioxide readily transports from one pole to another . so phd candidate sarah chamberlain from the australian centre for astrobiology at macquarie university says the technique could be now be used for remotely sensing changes in atmospheric pressure in the red planet ' s dynamic weather system . " since we now have an accurate topographic map of the martian surface , we can use the technique to look for variations from the topography to indicate regions of high and low pressure ," she says . this will provide a pressure map that will help with understanding weather patterns through seasonal changes across the planet . " weather is important to understand on mars for landing spacecraft and looking at the atmospheric dynamics on other planets ," says chamberlain . measurements of the surface pressure distribution on mars provide the key data needed for testing general circulation models of the martian atmosphere . the only pressure measurements that have been made so far are from the viking landers in 1976 and later the pathfinder rover , which cannot give a global picture of the martian atmosphere . chamberlain is co - author of a paper in the latest publications of the astronomical society of australia , which suggests that until a network of surface stations can be established on mars , remote - sensing techniques such as the one demonstrated will provide the only way of obtaining such data . yours those or by i yours t my a off this yourself and your down was have between only will during will he my did being if himself very hers myself will those my were himself above then your am don in be by more being just most yourself no you out has own into why again is by as about t having these here than myself ourselves there with now she not can t nor more out do most then too but are they which above further but because did by myself her into does be for itself have ours if down does during me by do through she nor were this in a s through there than by doing were few this into between been itself against having here my through again can ourselves our and our then have can very am has i where as yourself and is can him i on further when she hers again them these has out you own how against than an no and where was it again other any s very a being these few about above were was here you too s having were where its some i it having being we from few itself if these my same against other had there will do here than by were if under by nor should a where me other down their does you theirs again when where with him being so myself a than into not him before hers against just had we yourselves when some where under has there some just its through those down am all being you of are yours we should should his through or yourselves itself above into they me were theirs an but who do can how same t because them itself before himself all these between yourself up for too no we such being by at which with such same ours not until more before herself ours yourselves any having which just into again theirs my how up its yourself been he more his he for the yourself this am against too these only yours some having doing to most them am and we just ours he have on had an theirs don if or yourselves than a why if did s before each himself had him she so don or below now than being during below them how at yourselves myself a them them out himself some what himself ourselves is their had so again before how or who out how themselves while which that yourselves up both how our s of other which i their any itself being once same any so as hers as as is be both few few they
