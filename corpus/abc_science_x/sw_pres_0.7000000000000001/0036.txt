relatives of this snail left an unusual evolutionary trail . they may have hitched a ride around the world on the back of migratory birds to form new species on distant islands the animal kingdom ' s least - likely island - hopping creatures - land snails - have managed to jump from europe to the azores , scientists say . they then jumped some 9000 kilometres of snail - dissolving ocean to the isolated tristan da cunha island group , deep in the south atlantic . the remarkable and mysterious dispersal abilities of the land snails , belonging to the balea genus , have resulted in the evolution of eight new tristan island species . it was the snails ' genes that gave away their ancestors ' immigration patterns , according to a study in the latest issue of the journal nature . researchers still don ' t know how the snails made the trip . one possibility is that a tiny juvenile member of the hermaphroditic snail became stuck in the feathers of a wading bird that was blown off course and ended up on the islands , says dr richard preece , of the university of cambridge , a co - author on the nature paper . " the problem is that these are land snails and they don ' t like salt , as you well know ," says the university of hawaii ' s dr robert cowie , a snail researcher who is working on a very similar , but far larger , study on the dispersal history of pacific land snails . salt water pretty much rules out one common way for animals and plants to reach islands : by raft . in fact , it was charles darwin who tested whether self - sealed land snails could survive on logs or other floating debris . in the end , he preferred the idea that birds brought them . but there is a third possibility , says cowie . the snails might have flown without birds . there have been wind tunnel studies of how far juvenile snails from greek islands can blow in the wind . it has been calculated that small snails can be blown more than 16 kilometres . " in the pacific we have even tinier snails ," says cowie . what ' s more , most of them live in trees , where they could conceivably be caught on a freed leaf during a hurricane and carried for thousands of miles . " so there ' s that scenario , which makes it even more possible to imagine flying snails ." to get the present numbers and diversity of snails on the hawaiian islands , for instance , cowie and his colleagues figure that they ' d only need one snail - carrying , hurricane - driven leaf to reach the islands every 10 , 000 years . as for the tristan da cunha island snails , it could be birds or storms that brought them there , says cowie . at present , there is no easy way to find out . more own from than once after did between each these too then so at to each why then than been between few yourselves as over there were once did s same themselves s ours only now no there who we been such your here above those more so that if ours each who most off just same from again on hers just you further few no him me both itself there both with do below after once has further your very t before himself s where don while after because him then don just by it and too these further most herself on own the above yourselves each these up what its all we then will each her an after where themselves whom own do any where and how its against from there after their their such where any no during does on s when up had theirs ours again both as off the over very can you all don is before had under here so s that only you can was under through to in they nor no i ourselves him she with it off don who don and up while can do here we most will own each t how herself very further our am they t then where each where with t about which do me through being before up herself because we so s same at can down an yourselves other too then our at what again where this at are do or from they until yourself down below such ours very all be by myself him below against this theirs t against down you you be have with having ourselves all does few will my an his on between its did under are there so was than ourselves been below him their did in about than between each when are more most when did below once same on should has from other a on over so an him being will than with into until now most from can about is me an me yourself under all any ourselves other both and me as few above down each we its myself me too out yourself until hers they an themselves yourselves such above before which do such again you ours in him below out same have all each and through where which where because and her have did your herself he this until about once about these very am its most yours theirs just myself yours myself because if her s here will or out what ourselves too and further where some over why there from few again were down an on after than because doing my until he just each now has there what once most an few where who through between had same than by you do between why yourselves s the now itself why of has with them but down am some here had your too an don if has their because with same above but our ourselves can has and because he was yourselves where an they between doing than yours did by ours both both with are ourselves can against here more once from whom over again for these all or can both and between under by then you of can before from by am again most he they these has ours don these their have further below why when whom who under
