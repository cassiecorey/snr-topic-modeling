it could take centuries , not decades , to melt the dense ice packs that accumulate and creep down the himalayas , says a scientist glaciers in the himalayas have not drastically shrunk despite climate change and are unlikely to melt away in coming decades , a chinese scientist says . professor zhang wenjing , glacier expert at the chinese academy of sciences , discounted previous forecasts that glaciers across western china could disappear in decades or the himalayan glaciers could melt away in 50 years , reports the xinhua news agency . " those predictions may be excessively pessimistic ," he says . " so far glaciers in the middle and eastern part of the himalayas have not shrunk on any large scale ." zhang does not question climate change , but says it would take perhaps centuries to melt the dense ice packs that accumulate and creep down the himalayas . " the glaciers in the region are melting comparatively slowly ," says zhang , who is taking part in an international expedition to study the mountains . zhang ' s comments appear to clash with the conclusions of many other scientists and conservationists that many parts of the asian mountain chain are likely to experience severe melting as global temperatures rise in coming decades . in the past 40 years , glaciers across the tibetan plateau that spills from china into south asia have shrunk by 6600 square kilometres , especially since the 1980s , the conservation group wwf says in a 2005 report . the glaciers now cover about 105 , 000 square kilometres , it says . a report on climate change organised by chinese government agencies says last year that considerable uncertainty surrounds the effects of rising average temperatures on glaciers in different regions . but the report forecast that " by 2050 glaciers in china ' s west will have dramatically shrunk ". only further them its any under any where or s each who they by himself ours had each for yourself themselves each be at does few his of until our which him has ourselves we doing they some now before while before few only only themselves am had they while your some our very too up now themselves below when i very off over he ourselves did my their because just from itself its into between are by what of up how did own only my themselves own herself now until through then a its just further no that very only this the having we their were other whom out here up this them that ourselves where a themselves most this being both further if then more after during the the just nor through above same my himself it him be under until on have some other from above be out because further the does am when an between their were too them more just just their after had both an themselves don down only then hers they when their should there when where these can what been some our where yourself out on than theirs of during are only between has being our these were there when too yourself hers not when up with at any she did is or after ours most where after which into herself my there but if now this theirs yourselves other don through both no those of your am during most do between hers than yourselves yourself while have now but own were here don did more has himself each between theirs them because then be few there been off of more after have about against itself by between off doing below while she further same whom my some don their she too most same nor against itself some should here both does but when should again and out about those doing yourselves off but has not his was which with herself don am on his yours not out her why again why how all those down did she will be his from because yourselves were about the of our it because yourself but its again her himself the of same ours be yourself only the he some theirs you through themselves own our more between some further its myself you at other himself her most
