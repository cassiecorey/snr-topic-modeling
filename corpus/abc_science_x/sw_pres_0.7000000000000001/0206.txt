the mona lisa has inspired many imitations , like this poster advertising contact lenses hidden behind the mona lisa ' s enigmatic smile are millions of invisible dots , research shows . according to research presented recently at italy ' s uffizi gallery in florence , the mona lisa consists of countless of dot layers applied with a technique of microdivided brushstrokes . the dot research was revealed at the exhibition " the mind of leonardo - the universal genius at work ", which runs at the gallery until january 2007 . jacques franck , a consultant at the armand hammer center for leonardo studies at the university of california , los angeles , says the technique is somewhat similar to pointillism used by the french neo - impressionists in the late 19th century . " examples of this microdivision of tones exist since the ancient romans . leonardo took an existing techniques , but used it to the extreme , like nobody else ," says franck . the painting technique is called ' sfumato ', from the italian word ' fumo ', meaning smoke . and it produces an almost 3d effect , the result of the delicate brushwork that blends light , shadow , and contours . da vinci never really explained how he was able to blend shadow and light in such an imperceptible way . the only reference to the sfumato technique appears in his notes on the painting . " light and shade should blend without lines or borders , in the manner of smoke ," he wrote . applying science franck examined leonardo ' s works using what he calls an " archaeological approach ". he took a close look at another da vinci work , ' drapery study for a seated figure ', which hangs in the louvre , and noticed that leonardo used minute brushstrokes to produce the 3d effect of the draperies . " the technique is visible , as he used tempera [ a type of emulsion of oil and water , often using egg ]. on the contrary , in oil painting traces would have been masked by a delicate velatura or glaze ," franck says . franck , an artist himself , has been copying leonardo ' s works since he was eight . and franck backed up his microdivision theory by reconstructing the mona lisa ' s eye through six steps , represented by panels on display at the uffizi exhibition . he started with a poplar panel , similar to the one leonardo used to paint the mona lisa in 1503 - 1506 . franck treated the panel with gypsum and animal glue , then painted an eye with a brush , but using black chalk . then he applied a semi - opaque , diluted oil - based wash to soften the chalk lines and then retouched the details with microscopic brushstrokes . he had to apply many layers until they blended together . according to franck , details such as the smile and eyes contain between 30 and 40 brush strokes per millimetre . essentially , leonardo was working as a miniaturist would . " he may have made one square millimetre a day . this means it might have taken leonardo about 10 years to complete the mona lisa ," franck says . enigmatic smile lisa di antonio maria gherardini , the mona lisa , has been fascinating art lovers since her portrait was completed toward the end of the life of leonardo , who lived from 1452 - 1519 . attempts to solve the enigma around her smile , described by the 16th century artist and writer giorgio vasari as " more divine than human ", have included theories that the noblewoman was happily pregnant , suffering from asthma , had facial paralysis or that the smile was the result of a compulsive gnashing of teeth . franck ' s theory is raising a debate among art historians . " i find it absolutely untrue . leonardo did use the sfumato , but his painting technique is also very firm . i have seen the mona lisa under a magnifying glass and really , i could not see any dot ," says da vinci scholar and uk professor of art history martin kemp , from the university of oxford . franck argues that it is scientifically impossible to distinguish the dots with a magnifying glass . " light penetrates each dot , producing reflection , diffraction , and diffusion . thus , when you look at the painting , the surface appears homogeneous . no dot can be seen . moreover , in my works the dots completely disappeared within three years . the same might have happened with the mona lisa ," franck says . how about x - ray evidence ? indeed , x - ray images of franck ' s copies are very similar to x - ray pictures of the master ' s works : they all show something similar to smoke . " the layers of paint are so thin that x - ray simply goes through ," franck says . according to the curators of the exhibition , franck ' s hypothesis is " convincing ". " it is compatible with the material evidence of the mona lisa as analysed by the louvre ' s laboratory ," they write in the exhibition catalogue . on will myself it their herself in to my before few
