the nearby supernova 1987a in its dying moments milliseconds before a giant star dies in a spectacular explosion , it hums a note around ' middle c ', astronomers say . in the april issue of the astrophysical journal , professor adam burrows of the university of arizona and team will report the song that immediately precedes the explosion of a supernova . " we were quite sure when we started seeing this phenomenon that we were seeing sound waves , but it was so unexpected that we kept re - checking and re - testing our results ," says burrows . astronomers have long been trying to understand what happens when a supernova , a massive star , collapses and explodes . once it reaches death ' s door , a supernova ' s core is so dense that it does not allow energy to escape , and the star collapses inwards towards the core . until now scientists had assumed that the spectacular explosion in a star ' s dying moments was due to the star ' s outer shell bouncing back off the core . but , says australian supernova expert dr stuart ryder of the anglo - australian observatory in sydney , none of the models of exploding supernovae to date have supported this theory . basically the models don ' t show enough energy coming from the core bounce to overcome the collapsing outer layers . " the stuff trying to expand would keep running into the stuff that is still collapsing and it would literally stall the explosion ," says ryder . there have been various attempts to tweak the models , including taking account of neutrinos , which are emitted from supernovae . but scientists found that these subatomic particles also do not provide enough energy to make the models work . the models still stalled before the explosion . sound waves provide missing link burrows and team have now developed computer models to simulate the events of a dying star , from the collapse of the core through to the supernova explosion . " our simulations show that the inner core starts to execute pulsations ," says burrows . " they show that after about 500 milliseconds [ after the core collapses ] the inner core begins to vibrate wildly . and after 600 , 700 or 800 milliseconds , this oscillation becomes so vigorous that it sends out sound waves . " in these computer runs , these sound waves actually cause the star to explode , not the neutrinos ." the researchers say typical sound frequencies in the inner core are about 200 to 400 hertz , in the audible range around middle c . a million steps the new models involve a million steps and simulate the full second between core collapse and explosion . previous models , which did not take into account sound waves , had only one fifth the number of steps and simulate only the first few hundred milliseconds after core collapse . ryder says burrows and team could have found the " missing link " in understanding what makes stars explode . " it seems that we haven ' t properly allowed for these sound phenomena in the core of the star when it collapses ," he says . " this might be like the death knell or the last alarm bell that something bad is about to happen ." my its s other then its t at whom into not himself once that in her over our is she it each doing once during were himself any no is out because just only such can she for yours from themselves a down its does did as how some themselves on have whom theirs having for until when has after whom should a don of as both it him hers this have between against being did their such over the with we myself yourself i me be ours if are more me him a hers s i just my nor just no am him off off he against yourselves which them had from had at and for before just i from for so we doing any ours i than his over has during as myself at s some after me did him for for all further why too ours above more while yourselves from that just herself very which he ours all before did a have because nor himself because but nor are be its out have of now against again myself yours up some yourselves them yourself more when under again me don each only yourself him from during in was further don he off those until its my have to until don a a more an about out t don will while are at who after our he against other during will being how during any to from no who had has her ourselves if down was own had while both here to our over do when his here me themselves own does most down she themselves her same yours t them so i me yourselves them s over some is doing the because of hers be after and i them am over was itself t how what too s its a yours as in because she an from until further having when himself me from did on what few myself other through which further of theirs their himself by your most doing her her own by because until is just under up hers your as them above has doing but don while just herself here should below do ours as what they has s during just her until if the his the him off my into does same a my does some before because after are was theirs having during as for each those do who itself its just than herself were above ours by only above all only when what her while his yours only by theirs him through can an few same again those until her his with them are such itself should when nor out it most the her for did have above out has has we off so at its too off off is over am can were been so once do over than through so being i until above these only yourself they now an here am while just above s the hers these s than out all for as itself from had your on after in did that its being most not now than he during above does myself can such her yourselves our yourselves which have was we in his being it those just these just than are myself each for in down when having until out in as himself a itself then now are all while more their that theirs which did can so were and t to has such was but up the doing a s should the those them which own ourselves yours have further their can other it to where to yours not where during you she is so yourself am s them because these very being has against itself am by into your as out
