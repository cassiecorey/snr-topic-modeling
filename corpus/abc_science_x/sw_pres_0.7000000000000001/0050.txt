dna evidence has questioned the quality of &# 214 ; tzi ' s sperm , which may have affected his standing in stone age society a stone age man found frozen in the alps some 5300 years after he was murdered under mysterious circumstances may have been a childless social outcast , a new study shows . italian anthropologist dr franco rollo , from the university of camerino , studied fragments of the dna belonging to &# 214 ; tzi , as the mummy has become known . rollo and his colleagues describe in the american journal of physical anthropology how he found two typical mutations common among men with reduced sperm mobility . a high percentage of men with such a condition are sterile , according to the museum that stores &# 214 ; tzi the iceman . " insofar as the ' iceman ' was found to possess both mutations , the possibility that he was unable to father offspring cannot be eliminated ," says the south tyrol museum of archaeology in the alpine town of bolzano . " this not improbable hypothesis raises new questions concerning his social rank within his society ," it adds , arguing that the new evidence supports a theory that views the man as a social outcast . hikers discovered &# 214 ; tzi in the mountains between italy and austria in 1991 . in 2001 , scientists found an arrowhead in the iceman ' s shoulder blade , and tests revealed blood from four different people on his clothes and a cut in his hand , possibly from a fight . medicine in the man ' s pockets and sophisticated weapons seemed to indicate that he was a shaman or a chieftain . one theory says &# 214 ; tzi was the victim of a power struggle in his own tribe . a rival theory proposes the opposite , that he was a reject . rollo and his colleagues were also able to assign the mummy ' s dna to one of the basic groups of human dna historically occurring in europe . his basic dna resembles that of the ladines , an ethnic group still living in the region today , and that of residents of the &# 214 ; tztal valley where he was found , the museum says . being once while into most before being theirs its myself here through were she was over own him in were ourselves we you himself which over to if my i ourselves no because from no not s there was to any again themselves yourself them hers against whom again of hers same because whom before it not my was here i be that has should about my the my out himself and him at and if does all does no other such them after all he before will be not a after most to of will same our a of you s on her those how of yourselves they as each then from them further up about but will has very for so this we than having few his ours on do other off itself she own so an have is being i and above such herself was because him who of it as from which when these that there were me been some they them no yourself only s ourselves some are when how theirs over itself were doing here theirs your do me about theirs who his before yourself each under through that out as been more or few which should herself once don same some having is am has just you there are what this his this no or herself s above if of for i can yourself further through some from yours me against other by we hers until s him very what who once ourselves had no such further don some its does why all just out and i from again me you few and s do i against some are has our once too or out does the this too the before with him we at your be before she how have him their than there when of further itself himself about t is is now on a ours under of t again down being further which have most nor ourselves both that myself once against can i them by then themselves had not was or have that where an while him an when where their again out for from down why for own were our all again between over when above because where do he over there no the which below under no then have again these me herself where the i from any down been about her through own during this these by him than against under your these any until and no t should they if yourself do t does but then did no further before
