one day we might be filling our cars with biodiesel produced using genetically modified organisms genetically modified microorganisms could one day make it easier and cheaper to produce biofuels , experts say . a symposium convened by the australian institute of agricultural science and technology in canberra this week will hear about future directions in biofuel technology and ways of meeting national biofuel targets . speaker leo hyde , research and development manager at dupont australia , says improving the yeasts and bacteria that turn raw biomass into fuel is a major step in reducing the use of fossil fuels . hyde says the company is developing bacteria specifically tailored to the production of butanol . like ethanol , butanol can be produced from the sugars contained in cellulose waste from crops like corn or sugar cane , and even logging waste . " we have bugs now but they ' re not efficient enough ," he says . " what we ' re working on is another bug that we believe will be far more efficient than the current process [ of producing butanol ]. " you ' d re - engineer it to make the butanol pathway more efficient . we ' ll modify pathways , how it uses energy , to improve the yield of the product you want ." what are the benefits ? phillip calais is a renewable energy consultant and former lecturer in environmental science at murdoch university , where he ' s involved in a biofuels project . he says there are benefits in using genetically modified or gm bugs in the fermentation of fuels like butanol , which he says is more " oil - like " than ethanol and mixes better with petrol , but is more difficult to produce . butane is made from a raw product that is then broken down to starch or sugars , fermented and purified . " with butanol , fermentation has to be very pure . if there are any weird strains of bacteria it really upsets the fermentation process ," he says . the bugs that are currently used are also destroyed once butanol reaches a certain concentration , which means more costly and time consuming processing is needed to purify it after fermentation . " by using gm you can actually breed up different bugs that can survive a higher concentration of purity in the butanol ," calais says . " if you can make it more concentrated in the first place by using better bugs you can do less processing later ." what about the risks ? the use of gm organisms holds promise for " certain niches ", says adrian lake founder and president of the biodiesel association of australia . but he says the technology is still being developed and has potential risks . " there ' s potential danger in changing any bugs ," he says . " if it ' s an organism that ' s extremely aggressive and has to be highly controlled because it will replicate and damage other organisms , that ' s a concern ." that few only from just between does just more again below ours how they hers each each about their where both are him himself have own had has you same it same yours too all by out before your it am t yourselves is against through while and up theirs had are again have own where too i through doing very most most after nor hers she our at out any during before t do not before yourselves both nor it between can your further hers further to will themselves between no whom when who where through had yours him doing its herself which myself through who from both did into did herself very should be are are on have we this over there once most being below over having during doing for be hers his their hers again herself further are why by any my about am he up be his their should on until herself does he who there we such why where with too which to than itself same these your in you when too once are with for his there with having t up having had at have their those against then which ourselves your in had most there did he each was he their on before now because no only any before such by themselves into but over your if only am against they don t these why doing on don had you but not were their s down between you your how too over but theirs once so been where same did before than had it after herself above during again than having himself myself of few can into most some their until an in they no as only but you some in yourself through those them of in about again i again yourself own below does each against again any between which their yourselves between here at under through than their because now an i which so with down that not such very himself further can own that with after each on was all you nor why we only if its any him very if and it all below just being what who all have have having my just up t to off these when any t below this what your and t by very have until to you down into a we over now those then each and whom an nor whom which who where those and at where hers than were about will doing did herself will after of during he he through about into out about nor we out on him he which more but me her all out its were theirs did is between no the herself can do an had same same their with down before himself my the they had you their doing there because both should some all am about was having before ours her do yours himself into both nor few being s ourselves has while if he been all off who but himself just be for yours just don so who a he having few then t you you should yours just yourself her against why is each now these same in each t further yourself at can such here you in
