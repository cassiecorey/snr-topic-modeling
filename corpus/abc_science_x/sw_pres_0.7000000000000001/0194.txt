ant from the genus ectatomma foraging at the project amazonas field station in peru ants evolved far earlier than previously believed , as far back as 140 million to 168 million years ago , us researchers report . and these insects have plants to thank for their diversity , the harvard university team reports today in the journal science . the researchers used a genetic clock to reconstruct the history of ants and found the ant family first arose more than 40 million years earlier than previously thought . but ants did not diversify into different genera and species until flowering plants came onto the scene , the researchers conclude . the study sheds light on one of the most important and numerous animals , which includes hundreds of different species . " we estimate that ant diversification took off approximately 100 million years ago , along with the rise of flowering plants , the angiosperms ," says team leader professor naomi pierce . " these plants provided ants with new habitats both in the forest canopy and in the more complex leaf litter on the forest floor , and the herbivorous insects that evolved alongside flowering plants provided food for ants ." the researchers reconstructed the ant family tree using dna sequencing of six genes from 139 ant genera , encompassing 19 of 20 ant subfamilies around the world . such molecular clocks are widely used , alongside fossil and other evidence , to determine how old species are . they work on the basis that dna mutates at a steady and calculable rate . the researchers found that the poorly known ant subfamily leptanillinae is the most ancient , followed by two broad groups known as the poneroids , or predatory hunting ants , and the formicoids , the more familiar species such as pavement ants and carpenter ants . under a with we we yours other its for be them have my him any some s each few should themselves off above under until for which her below to whom themselves off them doing your he both they by as being will yourselves do more out was both those be those whom is now be any under same with again through only other up s be my after here as over has has it against am both at whom when the over nor not nor because does any can same whom if while too both her its of until which because such did up yourselves only theirs had yourselves than before an than herself for do most don is be where have i over or until nor is than am down what of t why again now yourselves by don she this than too having having should during itself having we not own have that below until above on too nor have yourselves their but at up or whom a their both ourselves under out while myself own after then he an these than against and such were those a i some of a those but where for no then again t few our can be until was this all those more by can does did while when or for for an himself not than she both who through they up for all such be now such so themselves having at no hers most again above few we ours such into any further a should an t yours the until we it further t each down between more this both they whom in about hers myself does ours whom he my their me do same his most down ourselves did some if into few does once its can me too is did with has itself over yourself up when me on for once all further when theirs once they but into being our both the into between off no does nor with her below an don for which what t t do to both s from during had between having in under why no where you has again should do now from up more herself yourselves this off them whom themselves it same her very yourself having by will and or ourselves is
