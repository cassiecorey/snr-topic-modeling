researchers can now test the effects of airborne toxins on human lung cells grown in the lab researchers are using ' mini - lungs ' made from cells grown in the lab to test the effects of airborne toxins after workplace contamination and chemical spills . the work has won dr amanda hayes , shahnaz bakand and chris winder of the university of new south wales ( unsw ) a eureka prize for research that replaces the use of animals or animal products . hayes says the use of human epithelial lung cells reduces the need for what are often inhumane tests on animals . traditionally , the toxicity of gases and vapours are tested on lab animals that are put into a chamber and subjected to lethal doses . but hayes says the need for such tests can be reduced by using human epithelial cells grown on a porous membrane . she says the method is well suited to field work because all investigators need to do is place the cell - containing membrane in a small diffusion chamber and pump in air . the ' mini - lungs ' can be subjected to a range of tests including energy metabolism and viability , to see how they are responding to the toxin . any cell death resulting from the exposure would immediately set alarm bells ringing . hayes says her group , the only in australia to use lung cells in this way , has been able to test the effects of chemicals like ammonia and formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds found in paints , solvents and pesticides . " the research may open new possibilities for toxicity testing of industrial chemicals , environmental contaminants , respiratory drugs , workplace airborne contaminants and fire combustion products ," she says . hayes says the cells tend to be more sensitive to toxins than a functioning lung but the in vitro effects of the toxins on the cells tally well with effects observed in animals . the same method can be used to test airborne toxicology on skin and liver cells , she says . other recipients of eureka prizes include : *&# 9 ;
