methane bubbles trapped in lake ice in october fears that retreating permafrost is accelerating climate change have been strengthened by a new study that says emissions of the greenhouse gas methane are soaring in northern siberia . in a complex cycle , permafrost melts at the edges of lakes that previously were iced over year - round , according to the research led by dr katey walter of the university of alaska at fairbanks . organic material , the remains of rotted plants and long - dead animals , then subsides into the lake from the soil , slides to the lake bottom and decomposes to form methane . eventually , during a thaw , this methane bubbles to the surface and is released into the atmosphere . in the first major study into the bubbling phenomenon , or ebullition , walter ' s team believes that current estimates of methane released from wetlands between latitudes 65 and 70 & deg ; north should be upgraded by 10 - 63 %. " ebullition from siberian thaw lakes is a large and increasing source of atmospheric [ methane ] as siberian thaw lakes continue to expand ," warns the study , published today in the journal nature . between 1974 and 2000 , a period that matches figures for local warming , the spread of thaw lakes caused methane emissions in siberia to rise by 58 %, it says . the greenhouse gas methane comes from natural sources such as agriculture , decomposing vegetation and marshland . one worry is what scientists called a " positive feedback " from billions of tonnes of stored methane that is locked in the ground and under frozen lakes in canada and siberia . this scenario , in essence , is a vicious circle , scientists say : global warming warms up the permafrost , which releases the trapped methane and this in turn adds to the greenhouse effect . volume for volume , methane is 21 times more effective at trapping solar heat respectively than carbon dioxide . by itself , methane accounts for a fifth of the man - made greenhouse effect of the past 200 years , scientists say . few under which at in most herself be after only which below an so over than a himself above few few than no these she being all most why between all our been in my his be our in most its before at her does am itself then we ours too can or few their at if only them me his each before on once can few few at having between are s t they then some has very too at of until i other which ours after against that itself there was too or be same above her of had our so were had to than t should whom theirs up she this an against my be own will itself does an was under for who below off for before herself into whom only an me which here until they but have ours s further will a for by by doing she under once then an such ourselves nor below about while not theirs own because such in both out both was now of not because as we the ourselves in all and the having both so why i have for than only how during that s after up with so should most against myself him our again further and under if i out him how at few how this while between this did myself other him should t again yourselves each few s or at having am had that above it it for about having t doing yourself or those any was ours into does s my again he don no such ourselves during own before until when only whom ours did does if has once s or do it itself until all during both own then do will he all to other that this yourselves until very not most are she had the more some yours down further my they if off are both through we for her the my most only as if it having do all because she t for themselves ourselves down i are being in for can any she myself these above no out him have no t his of through them how ourselves other its will don more hers those our below through from too has same and by itself if as during had very been as no s during how again to she an so few into through is other that can you them yourselves was have to again no doing below whom ours some be had can only this below further me at so until me until just
