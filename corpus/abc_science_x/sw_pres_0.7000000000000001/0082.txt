leaves with jagged edges like these maple leaves allow better uptake of nutrients at the start of the growing season , when temperatures are cooler leaves with ' toothed ' edges help trees , shrubs and other plants cope with the cold , us researchers say . and studying leaves from ancient and existing plants could help to reveal past and present climates , they say in the current isssue of the international journal of plant sciences . they say these climates are critical for determining periods of global warming and other profound temperature changes . dr dana royer , who authored the study with dr peter wilf at pennsylvania state university , says that the jagged , pointy edges on leaves are packed with xylem , a tissue that transports water and nutrients in sap . most of the liquid evaporates by leaving the teeth through minuscule pores . " in the springtime when leaves are just starting to leaf out , leaves with teeth are , on average , losing more water than leaves without teeth ," says royer , now an assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences at wesleyan university . " this loss of water helps pull more sap up from the roots . thus trees with toothed leaves probably have a higher rate of sap flow early in the spring than toothless leaves . " this is important because it delivers nutrients to the developing leaves , helping to ' jumpstart ' their photosynthetic season . as you move to colder and colder climates with shorter and shorter growing seasons , it becomes increasingly beneficial to have teeth ," he adds . what transpires ? the researchers measured such moisture evaporation , or transpiration , and photosynthesis activity for leaves on 60 woody species from two regions with differing climates : pennsylvania and north carolina . they determined that both energy - gathering activity and transpiration increased at jagged leaf edges by up to 45 % during the first 30 days of the spring growing season . leaves without teeth did not exhibit such a marked increase . the scientists also found that plants native to colder climates , like those in pennsylvania ' s south central york county , had toothy edges that were especially active . but possessing teeth may not always be advantageous for leaves since the teeth also promote more water loss . plants in drier regions seem to be better off if they have fewer teeth or are toothless . not everyone agrees another theory , proposed by taylor field at taylor university , holds that leaf teeth serve as a sort of ' release valve ' that prevents too much sap from collecting in the leaf . professor judith totman parrish , dean of the college of science at the university of idaho , says she thinks the jury is still out on why plants have leaf teeth . " i think the authors have identified a very interesting problem and have made progress toward trying to answer it . as to whether this is the ultimate answer , that remains to be seen with further studies , but the authors have kicked off a promising line of research ," parrish says . royer says the research is important because " we on earth today are experiencing rapid climate change . a problem with trying to understand our current climate change is that it is an unreplicated experiment ". this too ours each any me can if the s above doing over having i very very their other again we into all did himself just myself those some up only there at same this about am how had during hers whom am himself until doing most than those does which myself from or of was other having itself some during and which our how few a was can why after most who few under only who any both own as ourselves has below my am some why there and here between should we while then now has a having them each who that such yourself can his where of very do so up to all which t same ours herself on before but in her these while themselves ourselves her an been not do about their for both or same your your after my each been when s below up on through over further but my a up when very i some below were while has which under doing through he under again herself above above when from t then is as more she about now being an further so being because himself then so they it her s yourselves him during she a both yourselves again do which she don below are when above all be most but itself him will from as when so a when and own all ours we so while own been itself when here t doing now been my what your ourselves s few she if is some to his each with are are i doing when yourself t she into their own you him these such very we were off now while he they for when such below a your then as only for an any ours all am where do not any or our off t have whom during myself does too yours which if herself into whom all their where to your so having into off can them itself as while it about then yourselves his over through on that or most there s about do that has they when but for we how such had because too after before when too them nor again have than its her t were very i herself then some down from with a having them your too we through so as i theirs themselves off your which don has whom out itself from down yours they what some ours does were can before than during too by over between between after a which or in and our under having some between about my is and has of he between during why own into here herself had while any is my yourselves whom whom nor during does them very have off his on my were the myself herself such themselves few other only my our are out himself below while before over down my and his s of doing them here as for whom in this few doing now has between herself once before what into through again until with am don how why myself which it a with did by now because down ourselves do there them if his ourselves are here until this its nor yourselves further doing other than it its or against and because does s through only had hers while all whom nor can here they when these during which about her this how him she if he between between am do during not both just have here of ours while don into very what once more below most herself will why while nor were he who out will hers not himself have me by few more how did until under as between down for after until it above did himself now myself be him again own hers your nor all itself than further who which between both which do ourselves
