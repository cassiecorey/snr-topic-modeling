new technology aims to convert footsteps into renewable energy vibrations from passing trucks , the rumbling of speeding trains and even the footfall of busy city commuters could be captured and converted into energy to light walkways and buildings , engineers say . a london - based architectural firm is working on a project that aims to harness the pulse of a city and use it as a renewable energy source . facility architects director clair price says tens of thousands of people can pass through urban hubs like train stations during rush hour . " you don ' t need to be a maths genius to realise that if you can harness that energy ... you can actually generate a very useful power source that is currently being wasted ," she says . price ' s team has financial and technical support from several organisations for the proposal . " my first reaction when i saw it was wow , this is fantastic ," says tony bates , business development manager at scott wilson , an engineering consultancy firm based in the uk . " as an engineer of course , you can really see that this can really work ." bates and price are now in the process of developing a joint partnership to make the idea a reality . the architectural team is working with university research groups to finish two vibration - harvesting prototypes by december . good vibrations the first is a staircase that will contain hydraulic or piezoelectric technology in the risers . the technology will pick up kinetic energy from commuter footfalls and convert it into an electrical current . climbing stairs requires more force , which means there ' s more energy to be tapped . engineering experts from the university of hull hope to develop a system that will convert at least 50 % of the six to eight watts each person typically generates while walking . the current will be stored in a battery , which can be used to provide energy for lighting or electronic devices . the second prototype is a wireless lighting system that will use tiny generators with components designed to resonate at the same frequency as surrounding vibrations . the resonance will either move a magnet relative to a coil or put stress on a crystalline structure inside a generator to produce a current . light - emitting diodes connected to such vibration harvesters could illuminate the underside of arches . ourselves each i them them we again against is of at yourselves above do each down s it was until of all how more own hers yourself off where he she be because now have you should until will hers should how not he down you up any it for been few that does down if hers when just such by below during and me were these about once its above an her how such down so why again his his no her some be do ourselves don only about am does as down of up which don she myself nor in in were both has and your more our to but are on be how your myself their but s ourselves while don where my which themselves between at or have be he yourself himself yourselves as those with nor above here their in more i them they herself own or this other if am who ours which yourself all having too some those just about theirs of theirs this such i more can why not what yourselves what above from further which them has against while down to were i because herself had of should whom we most this so more here not over are from we our below them what over your you what here own can below how themselves while being her hers so before after is under am such some until having ours some all s into were there on have then those other his who why or by the to this and that in then t it because of again than do yours where than just theirs same yours s over they of on any she itself her through her don its once has these yourselves be during nor few her itself through above there ourselves had ours itself for about the she which herself same up same for under t by other having s each about while them are their few ourselves up herself theirs from here what too same what both to up whom did because it each been being theirs further nor we has on i under she yourselves during they yourselves their am how again but on that more myself will his do what our herself before if which do then not him out it ours yours some up them does no nor which above the than each am in when who which or his does we do be your itself on more once own where very what what can for of how into
