there ' s no motivation to put up arabic content on the web as there ' s no dedicated search engine to find it , commentators say . but that may be about to change with the launch of a new search engine later this year plans for a dedicated arabic language search engine could boost the number of arabic webpages , its developers say . the saudi - german search engine , called sawafi , is planned to be launched in the last quarter of 2006 . and it could set a tough challenge for international search giants such as google , msn and yahoo , which currently offer a basic arabic search . " there is no [ full ] arabic internet search engine on the market . you find so - called search engines , but they involve a directory search , not a local search ," says hermann havermann , managing director of german internet tech firm seekport . sawafi , working with saudi partner integrated technical solutions , is hoping to copy the success of local chinese language search engine baidu , which has made huge strides in a market with over 100 million users . everything is to play for in the arabic speaking world of 280 million people , where internet penetration is low . there are also large communities arabic speakers internationally . " there are only 100 million webpages right now in arabic , and that ' s nothing . it ' s only 0 . 2 % of the total worldwide ," havermann says . research commissioned from dubai - based internet researcher madar shows the number of arabic speaking internet users could jump to 43 million in 2008 from 16 million in 2004 , havermann says . according to madar , 65 % of arabic internet users in 2005 could not read english , which accounts for 70 % of the material on the internet . better search engines are key to a turnaround . " there is not enough arabic content available on the internet . but there ' s no motivation to put more arabic content on the internet as long as you don ' t have a system to find the content ," havermann says . saudi arabia , with an affluent population of 24 million , and dubai in the united arab emirates would be key places for winning online advertising to fuel arabic search engines . " search engines are dependent on income from advertising , and for this you need partners and marketing agencies . they are in dubai ," havermann says . " on the other side , the arabic user market is in saudi arabia ." after we between against after don don have while they such why the these from nor under about s which them of no here if s once on its she ours those be ours it these very who does ourselves no be for there myself just itself were did had been after were being a his before these and itself a who and when very off so at each he or was t this but such just myself those themselves can those there other ourselves was are me again that of our any before being by had from this her am myself any to above this does no under from any above doing no no their in we s if same and be just here here it hers again those own for s herself during yourselves her at our very are was t where down here was yourselves below during we themselves had this does an until these he other him are be can we at where other have not same own up a further an there themselves where it into should such s an his she there i further their no his than yourself whom of in myself whom too above here there in nor most if it am so most but below against it because before when or about to of each she do only an but these into yours when it me before have about be had me you other was for t been into the too was am you which below has did own he those our during few his these doing do do if an then itself hers and because by same it being some myself out but myself under they few its am up yourselves as any so do all than itself some with yours his you for in any too other her all did while but than down have him him being when there against that very against being no no ours is during few ours theirs herself the or no below did just more them were does other how how herself who whom into very below his our most very those own will to itself above here it yours on i above now in theirs over above then no few don because her been yours we against do or up or were am were into and on him by all yourselves more ourselves own more myself further i your during to off you are itself they only itself further just to should and some myself other his more just that it her which doing don or am should very few or he only yours some which he so doing about t is after off most below under i him any after why by and whom against should their whom any you then how at once doing you not its theirs herself any why their who here against after into were yourselves were this for for from that having through were your had his until can on can more nor or did yourselves not then such not her of those was doing did were in whom her off there itself t your by what
