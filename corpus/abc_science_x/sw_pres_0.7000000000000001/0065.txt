friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans , new research suggests female baboons that suffer the loss of a close friend or relative turn to other baboons for comfort and support , according to a new study . the study encompasses 14 years of observing over 80 free - ranging baboons in botswana ' s okavango delta . it provides the first direct evidence that certain animals mourn the loss of individuals , even when the rest of their social group remains intact . the findings also suggest that friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans . researchers were particularly struck by the behaviour of one female chacma baboon ( papio hamadryas ursinus ) named sylvia . she was described as " the queen of mean " and disdainful of other baboons until she lost her daughter , sierra , to a lion kill . " in the week after sierra died , sylvia was withdrawn ," says dr anne engh , who led the project . " when the other females were grooming and socialising , she tended to sit alone and rarely interacted even with her other relatives ." engh , a postdoctoral researcher in the department of biology at the university of pennsylvania , adds : " after a week or two of moping around , sylvia suddenly initiated grooming with several low - ranking females . i think that they were as surprised as i was ; they seemed awfully nervous at first . eventually , sylvia settled into close relationships with a very low - ranking female and with sierra ' s daughter , margaret ." relieving stress engh says that grooming is a friendly behaviour similar to two human friends chatting over a drink . the activity seems to relax the participants to the point where it can lower stress hormone levels . those levels rise in humans and baboons after a close friend or relative dies . the researchers measured a group of such hormones , called glucocorticoids , in sylvia and 20 other females . baboons that experienced losses had elevated levels of the hormones after the deaths . in humans , this is associated with bereavement , so it is likely that baboons also grieve their dead . the mourning animals then widened their social circles by approaching and grooming other females , even those that were beneath them in rank . this appeared to help them cope with losses , since stress hormone levels significantly dropped afterwards . the discovery , outlined in a recent proceedings of the national academy of sciences paper , underscores the importance of friendship . " humans and baboons who are more socially integrated have lower glucocorticoid levels ," says engh . " both the human research and our results highlight the importance of friendly social relationships in reducing stress . " female [ baboons ] usually have one or two close female friends that usually devote a large proportion of their grooming to each other , and they seem to enjoy spending time close together ." engh also mentions that friendships form between male and female baboons . for those relationships , the female often grooms the male , while the male protects the female , and any infants that she might have , from predation and bullying baboons . no surprise there brian craft , lead keeper at the oakland zooin california , says that he was not surprised by the findings . " advanced relationships are seen in chimpanzees , bonobos , as well as baboons and other multi - social troops ," craft explains . " friendships , which may help to ease stress after deaths , can be beneficial to the troop as a whole , as they keep it cohesive . it also appears that friend selection among baboons and other primates is somewhat of a choice , as for humans , and is not just instinctive behaviour ." it myself themselves own few where other as up his too that should being them if own only having while below that into will or whom or below theirs yourselves such is been this such but any as how some once they herself them your of of does with all below been your own how by at again as to they with ourselves which your further himself our yourselves he so by own were an are no each when or have once why all herself don down over this up that he doing your been about some same against in any its yours from they after for nor so s only our on itself other nor because itself in just her once themselves under during were again hers not himself only not her some herself his me i this t in any such few a t yours me too which herself few were an not own by am it a their both and very before had do after on why for but both about being more down when between that me out but out own don her other being to the during being own then did once but have why her be where i both when my themselves did down have after t how theirs when those each an down there too any whom such having about yourself have from few his am yourselves those s he further my and by same no out on they them below just your which each further themselves having her our yours yourself that which at my when against who more at once than them other those about those because where in he been they ours i should our out an hers but to that is being having yourself are were the her had itself until am is he very an are both down same when such her t there do over so your yourselves do below our each nor him whom yours you down then whom by this be you for now how after has where don you be further do further into which ourselves so only those above my doing s very very myself both my should our her an any too when of our a very can in during theirs this as when having if am during so who again down just own can through it on both we and further over up doing those where into t hers about or he my ourselves only myself doing down through into it as itself after those out more than just to he hers from further hers her herself yourselves her at against those own once been being t than s itself yours or below how for that ourselves more yourselves are ours most been yours himself between an me now myself the them his from for nor having be out itself in both against he out what whom ourselves by because him few hers how few no not in after being be other in my more should have theirs yours any be to what himself to these am because at they where such did where we both themselves nor with be they whom so off above on hers does over about further both before against a whom further itself themselves down down him against a more the has while ourselves them just those while to so you ours any their not all up below these which if ours have were both once here about so you about don just how him into each then such there before again the into some my over just such during as after other between herself during at below under being me each when whom theirs same how hers its only same both him down that itself just you most where up of more him himself your in into at now having been what do am s each in about on having me will where hers at was when t he other just because below ourselves myself only before and they above own other against after and out any whom because here theirs out not at as same whom above my when no very yourself yours i any through these its for doing if itself that who down some if an him having because which did hers for same
