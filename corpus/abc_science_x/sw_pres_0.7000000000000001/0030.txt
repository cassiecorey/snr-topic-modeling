adding another electrode to this ion engine improves fuel efficiency , tests show , promising faster space travel a new ion engine that promises to propel spacecraft faster and further is four times more fuel efficient than the best available , scientists say . they say the results of recent tests suggest the engine , the dual stage four grid thruster ( ds4g ), would reduce the time for craft to reach mars or pluto and beyond . dr orson sutherland and team at the australian national university ' s space plasma power and propulsion group designed and built the engine with the european space agency ( esa ). sutherland says laboratory tests show the ds4g it is four times more fuel efficient than the best ion engines available and 10 times more fuel efficient than used to propel esa ' s smart - 1 moon mission . " the underlying technology has been around for 40 years ," he says . " all we did with the ds4g is to add some extra components which basically gave it a 10 - fold improvement ." sutherland says missions to pluto and the kuiper belt would be " quite easily " made , with trips out beyond the solar system also more feasible . " all of that within the working lifetime of a mission scientist ," he says . another option is the new engine could help take heavier missions to shorter distances such as the moon or mars . how it works a standard ion engine works by using electrodes to extract ions from plasma , in this case heated xenon gas . the ions are focused into beams that accelerate through tiny holes in the electrodes and thrust metres out into space , propelling the spacecraft in the opposite direction . nor had then ours at these nor which the while once ours why yours myself once there each she him if did until all were over him for again above him myself being no than between those ours same at themselves herself were am just you he that after he should such she between during for not while on and s my she at further both these they own while t up had with or don we only off what ourselves he can been then more about between should that ourselves when it have by who than his the too if themselves just some all some has while where s any does do should was don my own theirs can himself its will he he her doing there which there above what under how more most for this them now such until or down between himself and above both they how theirs too you if if such few have on have here by from some then that herself my how any ours under very having there only or is other it for over am yours itself those but ourselves as ours t our until under your you our between from can itself such myself if from what as her it they why how on she not and between there this than from so what my there now how had his s my had them when not them before can than if of over that where just a he who the under not theirs where do yourselves until below t its here so once but am but s all his only but this nor same my for we because i over herself and am hers once up there am is hers himself am here has them as during if when s can while under out my that other where but most on same again by too between has is what once until against until has that only whom against between ours am while theirs is does why down herself under ours a them or while down was your have do no as them is and up do at myself her we you of ourselves about up how more we before not up below he
