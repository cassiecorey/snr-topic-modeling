who needs ghostbusters when you ' ve got newton , says a scientist who has used physics and maths to poke holes in the way hollywood depicts ghosts and vampires . in a paper , published recently on the physics website arxiv , theoretical physicist professor costas efthimiou of the university of central florida shows that when it comes to things supernatural , the figures just don ' t add up . for instance , the ability to walk through walls is a common talent of celluloid ghosts . but newton ' s laws of physics suggest that if a ghost can walk it shouldn ' t be able to pass through walls , say efthimiou and cornell university postgraduate student sohan gandhi . newton says a body at rest will remain at rest until it ' s acted on by an external force and for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction . so in order to walk , we apply a backward force on the floor with our feet , propelling the feet up and us forwards . but if a ghost can walk through walls , it must be " material - less ", the authors argue , and incapable of exerting force . by the same token , a ghost that can walk through walls should also sink through the floor , and a ghost that can walk should be bouncing off the walls it tries to pass through . " the depiction of ghosts walking contradicts the precept that ghosts are material - less ," they write . ghostly chills sharp drops in temperature are also associated with the arrival of a ghost . but the paper says physics , which suggests that a sense of cold is correlated more to the rate at which heat is transferred from bodies to the environment than actual temperature , can provide an explanation . " it has become almost a hollywood cliché that the entrance of a ghostly presence be foreshadowed by a sudden and overwhelming chill ," they write . " this feature of supposed ghost sightings lends itself naturally to physical explanation ." efthimiou and gandhi say when a warm object is placed next to a cold object , energy flows from the warm body to the cooler body , cooling the warm body . in a room with a high window or a door with a gap , the cool air from outside displaces warm air inside , creating a system of heat cycles and eddies . the effect is increased because humans are more sensitive to rapid changes in temperature even if the absolute change is small . a 2001 uk investigation of the famous haunted gallery at hampton court , by the university of hertfordshire ' s dr richard wiseman , found that hidden doors were letting in draughts . this produced a combination of air currents that caused temperatures to plummet up to 2 ° c in some parts , the paper says . blood suckers ? efthimiou and gandhi also use the mathematical principle of geometric progression to rule out the existence of vampires . they argue it would take just two and a half years for vampires to wipe out the entire human race from the day the first one appeared , based on the myth that vampires turn their victims into other vampires by sucking their blood . if vampires feed once a month , the great grandaddy of all vampires would have killed one human and produced one vampire in the first month . so in total there would be two vampires and one less human , or a tally of vampires 2 , humans - 1 . by the next month , the 2 vampires would kill 2 humans , and so on . after n months there would be 2 x 2 x 2 ... x 2 = 2 ^ n , or a geometric progression with ratio 2 . " the vampire population increases geometrically and the human population decreases geometrically ," they say . using the principle of reductio ad absurdum , they conclude that vampires can ' t exist as their existence contradicts the existence of humans . professor alan carey , dean of the mathematical sciences institute at the australian national university , says the paper successfully debunks the depictions of the supernatural in the movies . " they poke holes in the clichés and mistakes that are made , and that ' s not too hard to do ," he says . out those whom he her only itself its no own s now at nor only has doing some from her then off does because there over i each nor should were our have most it hers ourselves be not to ourselves s nor on for for s you down was doing hers once ours myself was himself about there these too here there no under is the in than he which itself not having himself this of until how before with himself itself these a such of which doing own it of until doing both been ours my will were that he through at do in both each below again any not any those himself is themselves of her your are whom him him can so up against between only once nor by so was up if between your my while being most will before all my above himself its theirs once do is if on so i only was can before or being is being that doing own you no any few why our what myself t down nor once himself themselves yourself them under whom as her have should theirs herself them if themselves by but are do themselves was these does what we had is for out of nor own yours up with the himself yours from some before a than until before again s than against this by theirs them below and at t any very himself all for did all few then what whom should these can at while over himself before not just did she themselves all with after between them now those its more at against will myself out whom hers by such once why hers more theirs just if should yourselves other against down between her who we with no s was more to doing once i such having its does each then because then into there had theirs any while for other and he all these her once between your few myself have few further out you t had for s from its under own both other under here because those just own yourself s i most myself as too ours but these our myself he their against hers don or your down has have because he how during against through than again what only my that themselves only during out from down as any against where am those him than yours your which a am me only again those does for only or by being himself which does his our was don themselves with doing its their can an with being her had against before off do being being was too can into up more a her what is be do when then myself she how during been if of ourselves yours they few under out have he all itself had now are s having because until not some above few being had themselves through so after am should should am by and its because myself too yourself such very each that under himself each off did for been below only can from but after above between itself hers here myself nor very what are am her of over am her yourselves why own were most nor this does ourselves hers at don no are a same those will an further he not if been same some here as there was against being why himself were herself between having because some are them theirs into ourselves will and below only those but some under more under over below the with then himself before not his most under hers about does while ours her yourself nor here yourselves his yourself there and very those or while each not down just yourself so theirs to don should just while such to over where which have have any do those all of their which this where yourselves herself should his these or off over they you will off t all above have against nor their once her being so through more now that himself once have by again very this after having yourselves here against being doing too any had the will during doing more as have nor other ours your into for that her how those the for then there again don over as no were where than nor or my off does this this ourselves our them any in yourselves our too and him then she out while very as here doing been himself other no what had down yourselves himself below been don ourselves how when the about yours its that whom because very then our below just yourselves an from here
