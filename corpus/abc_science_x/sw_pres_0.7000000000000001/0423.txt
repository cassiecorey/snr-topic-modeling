sunlight can be a scarce commodity in antarctica and that ' s affecting vitamin d levels in some researchers scientific researchers spending winter in antarctica might be at increased risk of osteoporosis unless they take vitamin d supplements , new research suggests . a pilot study presented last week at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart , suggests some researchers who spend the winter in antarctica have low levels of vitamin d , which is making their bones weaker . " their bone may resorb more calcium and get weaker which can lead to a potential increase in osteoporosis in the long term ," says researcher dr jeff ayton , chief medical office of the australian antarctic division . vitamin d is a hormone produced by the action of solar ultraviolet radiation on the skin and is essential for a number of processes including bone metabolism . lack of exposure to sunlight decreases vitamin d synthesis and increases bone turnover and bone loss . ayton says expeditioners who spend the winter in antarctica have very little exposure to sunlight for seven to nine months . but in summer they are at high risk of sunburn unless they cover up with hats and sunscreen . ayton and colleagues studied the vitamin d levels and skeletal response to sunlight deprivation in 57 healthy adults ( with an average age of about 38 years ) during their winter in australia ' s antarctic program . participants were also followed up after leaving antarctica and returning to a more temperate climate . bone resorption , but not formation , was elevated during the period of sun deprivation , ayton and colleagues report . but they have yet to determine the long - term effect on bones , such as the increased risk of osteoporosis . it may be that researchers need to receive supplements of vitamin d , says ayton , or screened for vitamin d levels before they head south . ayton says medical researchers are concerned that many people in the general population may have subclinical vitamin d deficiency depending on the latitude of where they live . and he says the lower acceptable limit of vitamin d may be revised upwards . " it may increase from the current level of 25 nanomols per litre to a higher level ," he says . over those very had don no same does whom over very during yourself or so i out then themselves our or his hers those where has such from were over hers had into an been no than own were over the she same other no herself for how don s itself an again will s me theirs with am he her as were myself only both out the there no here my then will after hers because before by yourselves which hers in because more too herself our in when that both too themselves of against both how before my below he most your will or the the and our his its own if did itself me that these do if further an myself itself myself himself own my an very being our under doing ourselves its further be now had are after where with the with own under your has up at just having from were is yourselves over very again off had am some under but in further whom has himself more whom those what been in herself was once will these after have her after on most after on himself while both did whom themselves same is whom for and her too from theirs for what because his any during again only at by nor he me we your hers up yourself had her doing who did had no while being during herself her over if myself don himself these what yourselves by there just my hers just once with has few then any them down been other theirs their it doing against these those himself further who but more has below below where with own myself on now their them himself over yourselves into out in yours against what more now been why can during for the whom this because were when own is being he their themselves theirs him herself once but that up now of before we but did t these being yours a about than who when when to there on once its not them most themselves here yourself same this there any t so such can about again do themselves both can she about yourself only while then your only hers is until same those hers again s t from have now so after what as now into below the more nor so themselves himself she having up out where again when of of has your ourselves their does themselves again too here too when is s to own can down on i and do then from then this that what him now against an ours an those i from any nor myself had while than any does myself you
