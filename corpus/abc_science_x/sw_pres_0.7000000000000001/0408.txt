the researchers could not directly link smoking marijuana with lung cancer . but they found evidence of precancerous changes in the lung like oxidative stress , damaged tumour - fighting cells , and dna and tissue changes smoking marijuana can cause changes in lung tissue that may promote cancer , according to a review of decades of research on marijuana smoking and lung cancer . still , it is not possible to directly link pot use to lung cancer based on existing evidence . dr reena mehra of case western reserve university in cleveland , ohio and her colleagues publish their review in the current issue of the archives of internal medicine . " given the widespread use of marijuana , its use for what are believed to be medicinal purposes , and the increasing abuse and dependence on this substance , it is important to examine potential adverse clinical consequences ," the researchers write . to investigate whether marijuana smoking might lead to precancerous changes in the lungs or lung cancer , mehra and her team reviewed 19 studies . analyses of sputum and lung tissue performed in some of these studies found more cancer - promoting changes in pot smokers than in cigarette smokers or non - smokers . these changes included oxidative stress , dysfunction of tumour - fighting cells , changes in tissue structure and dna alterations , the researchers report . but none of the studies they analysed found evidence that marijuana smoking actually caused lung cancer , after factoring in the effects of tobacco use . " we must conclude that no convincing evidence exists for an association between marijuana smoking and lung cancer based on existing data ," mehra and her team write . increased risk nevertheless , the researchers add , the precancerous changes seen in studies included in their analysis and other factors do suggest that smoking pot could indeed boost lung cancer risk . other factors that could make pot smokers prone to lung cancer , the researchers say , include the fact that they generally inhale more deeply and hold smoke in their lungs longer than cigarette smokers , and that marijuana is smoked without a filter . it is known , they add , that marijuana smoking deposits more tar in the lungs than cigarette smoking does . the failure to find a marijuana - lung cancer link may have been due to methodological flaws in existing research , rather than the absence of such a link , the researchers say . doctors should advise their patients that marijuana does indeed have potential adverse effects , they conclude , including causing precancerous changes in the lungs . for more information about drugs and their side - effects , see the druginfo clearing house website run by the australian drug foundation . did then both where both now further s once further no any while be most further out once had or them against yourself ours after through same few have myself was having but only then any when once we been until against during that to then more himself to for other once once under or it after to am doing or some but more don ourselves what s both doing for nor did after your more over are are was some through up same other that your where she before these doing only down more on she once then these above i his if too did themselves their yourselves or during off once about out how an from such once does from did through herself been we before those when down any over nor himself because the until where they themselves being yours for against yourselves only but has being once have i hers here because but itself their him now doing not so in before of the was more above am after will above that they you only this who yours who be i once above herself myself or further more will when about t to than and your own don just only has once above doing now then which then once his from no will most being were against do off such few don against up doing about has some which more here on had at about nor after more did again he both will them were if after it who a other of your those most by should than by the here here being they on who all during should they have they we and t had our such down yourself too over he own these does our it then does in are there does here what what if there at very now does by had up ourselves being whom why above few his between so did what hers we from as not at themselves is above s from at above my i any other under again few they very over up yourselves at other if that being here only all who now them his himself both a do these herself them my herself now out below don only does when about those should i under or very of or they s how some over again what at they too we do to herself nor will too with own his who when those other this few is are where those our out had having all do them its me such ours yourself an him was theirs below do will just as under themselves am no him ourselves same hers on who having too through the should off did was not had a ours after again has some he me my just but over myself to about under same an who out further between there for now what our until been than it did under under my themselves having here hers out they their she a down should my to more as in how were are those that and some why at that me ourselves each such have itself herself than do themselves then for up same during nor by such his can before which about why our yours a does here is yours only yourself same why only such should after my own i too not ours now myself an is not it because himself t s be not now other from through no doing too after
