a relative of this ancient marine organism used to dig through the mud , forming a network of tunnels trilobites , the extinct marine creatures famous to fossil - hunters everywhere , may have once done digging of their own , say uk and swedish researchers . rocks found in a swedish limestone quarry contain the remains of trilobites inside networks of tunnels , which appear to have been subsurface thoroughfares for the little bug - like organisms . " it ' s very rare to find a trilobite in a burrow ," says amherst college ' s associate professor whitey hagadorn , an expert on tracks , burrows and other ' trace ' fossils that can give important clues to a long - lost species ' behaviour and environment . there ' s only one other such fossil known , he says , and even that one doesn ' t show evidence that the tunnels were much more than single - use , one - way streets that collapsed after the animals made their way through the muck . " the fact that they form open networks , that is new and different ," says hagadorn . such sand - filled tunnels are common in the fossil record , he says , and have generally been attributed to soft - bodied animals that left behind no hard parts . but in recent years , palaeontologists have begun to suspect that trilobites may have also done some digging . finding trilobites inside tunnel remains in sweden ' s 465 - million - year - old holen limestone is , therefore , a fitting but unexpected hint about how the ubiquitous creatures fit into the palaeozoic ocean ecosystem . dr lesley cherns of cardiff university says these particular fossils were found by accident . " we sat down to lunch and i noticed that there were trilobites in these burrows ," says cherns , who co - authored a paper in this month ' s issue of the journal geology . a life underground the trilobites were probably killed by something like a sudden upwelling of oxygen - poor water or some other quick and deadly event , cherns explains . the tunnels were then soon buried by a thick layer of mud that sealed them off from scavengers and helped to preserve the evidence . no - one is quite sure what the trilobites were doing underground . they could have been hiding from the nautilus - like predators that cruised the palaeozoic oceans , says cherns . or they may have used the water flowing through the tunnels to help oxygenate their gills , like some modern lobsters do , she says . hagadorn has other explanations . " they could have been going down to eat , reproduce , hide ... who knows ? " hopefully this will motivate people to go out and look for more of these ." that could eventually answer some of those questions , he says . into what no don too few been him i having what been what we in here so s only up between for the was t should ourselves were off why ourselves into all themselves him there into am his here other to we any will here hers who down when both me from was by being under but been some but all who before itself during me am they his do same on with very did me on are have these then theirs theirs do there who after other her you some no after with be was who is under from with being who me are an same too t between after have same very i t more both some only had should with only it themselves from being those yours more did above any now theirs while have our having you or his on during don more me himself that under their both were very your from at while most with yourself has under an during myself myself about other other this between off during before we against is your out be if or hers some yourself there up their than here just own it as themselves when just on yours which by again between its i this most has very there its out hers were our now themselves now other most will yourself after when those them any a same was during about theirs too doing herself only as other before too a ours he an under until other does no above has will why no what s yourself this no itself own me were which but for am out are there most doing here its don your then were once yourselves his having most by during yourself and when then t at of into herself you on about from same we ours same ours and after what is myself off will them until was with no into him them such that don hers with be are for or over does the during himself most the doing a which theirs then few t whom any during doing yourself before at other both up such being this in few it some has our ours a our both most theirs when against herself her yours after but only and his himself their for after do here same its having that and between doing during through its some than after then from own who she her who my into there these few while into same above himself if such until itself about yourselves have himself but both after these over t whom into again here have very out him some with me up themselves not below any her her what over which very there don is will s most by own ourselves too being the do for when had under she him if about up he having if all yours themselves herself its some yours have his nor am does being from it what they or my same here will itself at not nor some some my their which few don a not to then his a down while myself here than they herself don some all don who she its off out being are because myself them how myself he did yours has where had if just was over
