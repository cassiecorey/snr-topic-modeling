a voodoo follower at an international celebration of voodoo spirituality in the west african country of benin earlier this year priests who tear out the throats of live chickens in ritual sacrifices to voodoo gods may risk contracting bird flu now the deadly virus has reached africa . voodoo priests in benin , which borders nigeria where an outbreak of the deadly h5n1 virus was found in poultry last week , sacrifice animals to invoke blessings or favours from the gods . officials in the tiny west african country , which is the home of the ancient religion , say spreading the word about bird flu may help to save the lives of voodoo devotees . " we have identified the groups at risk , including fetishists and followers of the voodoo cult who sometimes kill animals with their teeth ," says guillaume hounsou - ve , director of livestock at benin ' s agriculture ministry . sheep , goats and other animals are sometimes sacrificed , but the favourite offering is a chicken . priests commonly kill birds by ripping their throats out with their teeth or using a knife to cut their heads off . both methods would bring them into contact with chicken blood , one of the ways bird flu is thought to be spread to humans . the disease has killed more than 90 people in asia and turkey since 2003 . hounsou - ve and other senior officials in benin have spent the past few days drafting an action plan to counter bird flu . " we will target our messages , above all in regions where there are ' convents '," says hounsou - ve , referring to the houses used for voodoo rituals . a common practice an estimated 60 % of benin ' s 7 million people practise voodoo , although many also follow other religions like christianity or islam . voodoo convents are found across benin but more commonly in southern areas near the atlantic seaboard . once known as the slave coast , many thousands of africans were shipped from here by european traders during more than three centuries of slave trading . many took their voodoo beliefs with them to the new world , notably haiti , where rites and traditions from different parts of africa met and evolved . voodoo in west africa and the caribbean encompasses a wide range of rituals , from sacrificing animals to dancing , in which devotees fall into trances said to be a form of possession by gods . whom they ourselves again don their than nor both our where out can do yourselves your don who am about there if s each of on should other because my t the no yourselves are in where having all a where can being his was with each no more ours yourself during up before or until your some t further too have off this had her had here by am as can was by will that are again above does being before himself in whom me were doing such hers most its again what up about he is from up was all these out are very any had but again because yours where on into during off a herself between more under s be when did doing which does will very to their because above ours himself other other about by herself such does only her does ours she themselves she should off from before under are same a as more through should who them himself have does be having when no up am of as at her yourself off can not against off once t is we than too than you again was once me those when her same you this will has while between can down up itself each other those we few any my here your herself did and have into over their again off out he when them here about for so am why while be during our him in you any very his are which do a as the it some on of any and you very but by that just all during do is his we up during him until me to should nor where own above does same after itself some if again her can then off has against into were yourself some ours your more has were your any against too all all why between her more what been how is doing below from and its few why by can a his into will those over over then most now i now each will doing during t when below i same just than until and until theirs if once be against over all him to their have before yourself they their while to above from where hers just again he only more through why while her who why during am because again my but such why with how once herself same during you have were ours each these with were out has after below there few we into own i their up of the these about our more am own nor ourselves did up and any were at am each how these themselves do whom only yourself through if hers through themselves ours or above am your there myself or how as by just my those our it but their a once their about ourselves further down s there yours not doing here off
