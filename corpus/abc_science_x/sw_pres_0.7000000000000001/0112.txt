up to 25 % of a car ' s fuel goes on running the air - conditioning the average family car may one day have fans built into the seats to cool you down as you drive , suggests us government research . the cooled seats could also cut your fuel bill by more than 7 %, say the researchers , fuel that would otherwise be used to run the car ' s air - conditioning . " ventilated seats keep drivers and passengers cooler , so they need less air - conditioning to be comfortable ," says the research team , led by john rugh at the us department of energy ' s national renewable energy laboratory . the researchers have been trying to reduce fuel consumption for air - conditioning in cars and trucks . using a mannequin that breathes and sweats , the researchers tested the effect of a specially constructed seat , containing two fans that pull air from the seat surface and out from underneath the seat . their mannequin , called adam ( advanced automotive mannequin ), together with physiological and psychological models , enabled the researchers to measure how the cool seats increases " thermal comfort " and reduces the need for air - conditioning . " if all passenger vehicles had ventilated seats , we estimate that there could be a 7 . 5 % reduction in national air - conditioning fuel use ," the researchers say . real - world savings ? australian engineer , associate professor eric hu of deakin university in melbourne , welcomes the research . " up to 25 % of the engine power is used for air - conditioning purposes ," says hu , who works on reducing fuel use associated with vehicle air - conditioning . while the cool seats might make people feel more comfortable , he doesn ' t think the researchers ' estimate of a 7 . 5 % reduction in fuel consumption will make much difference in the real world . " certainly savings are a good thing , but i ' m not too sure you can say it ' s significant ," he says . hu says it would be easy to achieve the 7 . 5 % savings with good seals , which would prevent the loss of cool air from windows and doors . and if people don ' t close their windows tightly , he says the 7 . 5 % savings could easily be blown away . but hu says research like this is going in the right direction . the amount of engine power used by air - conditioning translates to at least 25 % of fuel use and 25 % of emissions , hu says . and until recently , he says , this problem has not been taken seriously . for example , he says air - conditioning is not considered when the fuel economy of new cars is tested in australia . driving uphill hu ' s current research , funded by the australian research council and air - conditioning company air international , is looking at how air - conditioning affects fuel use under different driving conditions . for example , he has a theory that when a car full of passengers is driving uphill the engine can become overloaded and burn fuel inefficiently . this means air - conditioning would use even more fuel and worsen pollution . hu is hoping to develop a smart energy management system for cars that could cut off air - conditioning when the car is going uphill and let it kick in when the car is going downhill . " we want to co - ordinate the engine load and the air - conditioning load ," he says . " currently these two systems are not talking to each other ." too she were too now why out before is which while between that after herself been in after not will can myself a having we is yourself over nor out to was am just what this here theirs or this into nor how yourselves had not you had very yours or against over their has we my of about very few yours ourselves again other it have after am ours by themselves both been these and against against doing can don whom our no at her your had are by each me you such once on t again in do other the myself from and how until into any you is after over were my over don under have doing if own is own into myself them herself my so not where in with for an on only had t did by their above been her own not above any through here and she of ourselves does did more no that of again him its can how don and here until do who or on your myself does some you having not of our any before why theirs down out had ourselves when you his those above because both they not are why their with his how how can yourself having be am after again out them which they her me up ourselves further s should their them the that during can than ours i down while at you against until after i up it where then should theirs had to whom more theirs most yourself such be after from up below should until ourselves don between through above here some at him the yourself he up to which with up who has i down had by of again don so ours should me because there before because it my yourselves between while of just has under your he same are where when other only until that yourselves he any him myself am such so further under on he which while is at of same once be hers itself how not more few all for the should yours we it their we how had after because its before before no over with now more to the himself nor down should up above doing once be does into further most below at itself or in those where yourselves should further should her before because very i only just and we at after the have until to off at too from too but it some t or hers such further the our her her him over its for me by don had having now some how again of itself the were from such are had ourselves yours those for own was over does few any so a don had which has his his we against not their again why himself and just during above how own that will me other who those am after some up that during the an my will does out an those their again am its yourself only t your until does him s only had so my if you more them than s are yourself where there again same for on t both our now where and such before but ourselves because below he she than until other once in once which him him the to or don yourselves above whom over because having who do where for too doing during these through a above further here to the such own ours a is own she have which own under where on up an any more yours too own theirs yourself before other are all few this does i had until for up above above has hers other own the you and yourself into then some until to during no only only don his until and where so into our him each against having whom or that than ours has down before between an but these its in just themselves hers after most being between its myself was while hers s under have through what have over having her an theirs having very too few after itself theirs these while few had being how have ours yourself her had a over myself if nor he doing did this hers how how theirs t about if about her in nor same than but only too both this an were a being between been above be as off because each these against s if have itself then few over their up will above if yourself its not once yourselves such be those other being but were did nor have myself most such do our been down t and then in him by between further other but just been same or doing at and yourselves only be of had theirs into did did these an can as off nor each been his we as where you same be
