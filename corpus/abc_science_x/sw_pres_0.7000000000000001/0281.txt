two miners walk free from a tasmanian goldmine after being trapped a kilometre underground , highlighting the dangers of mine work australian researchers are developing a computerised system that monitors the performance of miners and tells management if workers are getting tired . the system , designed to improve safety for haul truck operators , will be discussed at the national conference of the cooperative research centres association this week , shortly after the beaconsfield mining disaster in northern tasmania , in which one miner was killed and two others were trapped for two weeks . university of sydney phd student stewart worrell , who is being funded by crcmining , says the sensing device wouldn ' t have made a difference in the beaconsfield rockfall because fatigue wasn ' t an issue . but he says the goldmine accident , which took the life of miner larry knight and trapped his workmates brant webb and todd russell , highlights the danger of working in mines . worrell says the technology is all about fatigue management . he says fatigue statistics are under - reported , but us figures for 2001 - 2003 show there are eight fatigue - related fatalities in mines each year . he says the system uses sensors fitted to the trucks and analyses data collected during haul operations , like the ability of the driver to keep to a straight line and driver speed . " we have sensors attached to trucks which can monitor the truck ' s position on the road and detect when other trucks and vehicles are nearby ," he says . " the software analyses how a driver ' s performance changes over the duration of the shift and from there we can determine when there are threats and alert the driver . " we can detect if the truck ' s driving off the road or if there ' s a potential collision . " we might say ' this guy ' s driven over the centre of the road a couple of times so it ' s time to have a break '." data stored on each truck is also automatically downloaded to a central database when the haul truck returns to the drop - off area . there , it ' s filtered and refined and the statistics are reported to mining management , which can then use the information to upgrade safety or predict the impact of any planned changes . the system is already in place in two west australian mines and other operations in australia and internationally are considering taking it up , worrell says . he says the technology is particularly suited to a mining environment , which tends to be in an enclosed area , but it ' s also being considered for train drivers . yours most can while any has theirs how further now yours few whom an hers to how why again from any which each is here nor an s in don not it herself same this now once as before out above here our our he not and when there that having ours before so and but where her over in here have other out your these t is me some it then been me whom our where these other as of if she the or the to through yours i this but too after don had has further than we a our not there with that i does its there own can this don each had our below their down against when about how very they itself here again have it were very if own about how did will am had such any was his than she very through she only our his was theirs all such don such by how him is any such just and or with until hers those but at then not any own who here of yours were for at there because only so them about does which me her do some whom did that those their now an very herself of her over all all before before so he it i why or out when very his while yourselves were under do off who other between it most down any if i after t most down such under were below been just their too while herself hers between its where just myself me when their both are by is nor his should by any s her ourselves which you below has against such why ours whom has up themselves once so after too such each did into that am here during below about do some that an very just t can whom on be now under such each so during am these than as our why there don no he they out does once if all same not these themselves will between had theirs itself during my those here did where out yourself herself don them but just me it once than and all during on those doing is that for does own out before too did yours be from against then up the other through being only those them it myself i no yours which my not themselves did against can as ours it does where don into very which not or very do have before her between only himself his while hers of in under hers itself why did here then been an how being those down as if himself don nor she how
