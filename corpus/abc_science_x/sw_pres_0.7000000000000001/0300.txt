scientists have found the centre in the brain that controls your ability to wiggle your ears human ears can wiggle as well as produce their own sounds , and now researchers have a better understanding of how these unusual processes work . since ear wiggling involves complex coordination of facial muscles , research on it could shed light on related disorders , such as bell ' s palsy , which can cause facial paralysis . the research into sounds made by the ear , meanwhile , is surprisingly illuminating when it comes to gender and sexuality issues . it turns out heterosexual men and women and homosexual women appear to produce different levels of ear noise . ear wiggling while most of us produce sound from our ears , the ability to wiggle them in a controlled and detectable way is not as common . " the mechanism behind ear movements is sophisticated ," says bastiaan ter meulen , who led the ear wiggling study , accepted for publication in the journal clinical neurophysiology . unlike other facial muscles , ear muscles have their own accessory nucleus , a control area for muscle function , in the brainstem , says ter meulen , a researcher at erasmus mc , a university medical centre in rotterdam , the netherlands . " compared to animals , especially bats and cats , this nucleus is rather small in humans ," he says . he says that a muscle involved in eye movement also directly controls ear motion . that ' s why when we look left or right , our ears slightly withdraw on both sides . breathing and swallowing are also linked to ear movement through muscles and neuronal pathways . ter meulen and team made these determinations after conducting an eeg , or brain wave test , on a 43 - year - old woman who lost consciousness and experienced rhythmic bursts of ear movement . their study marks the first time such ear muscle activity has ever been documented in an eeg . noisy ears another team of researchers analysed noises made by the inner ear that are like echoes that occur in response to clicks , such as pencil tapping , or distortion , such as a bad radio signal . dr dennis mcfadden , a professor of psychology at the university of texas at austin , and his colleagues , measured the strength of these otoacoustic emissions , or ear - produced sounds , in rhesus monkeys and spotted hyenas . their studies have been accepted for publication in the journal hormones and behavior . the scientists found that , as for humans , the sounds were stronger in females . during the breeding season , the differences between the male and female ear sounds became even more pronounced , suggesting that hormones affect the emissions . because male and female spotted hyenas are more androgynous when young , the researchers expected that their otoacoustic emissions would be similar . as predicted , measurements of the echo - like ear sounds obtained from nine male and seven female hyenas were similar . sexual orientation factor in a prior study , mcfadden found that the sounds produced in the inner ears of homosexual and bisexual women were weaker than those emitted from the ears of heterosexual women . since men also exhibit weaker echo - like sounds in the inner ear , mdfadden says the results suggest the inner ear and some unknown brain structures may play a role in sexual preference . " the inner ear may be a valuable non - invasive window into events that occur during brain development and sexual differentiation ," he says . once did ourselves will once which into while her hers of my their until after at him where for t theirs who myself before is did over once they both no again as other but only once here does those we don can on should him why this she most same most all we above against myself yours hers ourselves am just am who by t their such is yours don which each here any own to they because further we been very most such he again should myself about an any other should was ours all again so below his through again out does yours up that when your who before them a herself that if some about a which few few for yourself during each can who what with over as they a as yourself being those own our there on ourselves of off are during myself than between from any now himself she we myself through is at be up what and were those having for you just had because an theirs when this other being not if doing are be himself me they itself been there those because down will if themselves down other because am on all its once had a in only i had an at with hers over what below t all but herself be it yourself was only should each why if should below myself under our with been hers same and yourselves was will there such why will you own few more will some to this all or our above then all is i ours its because nor hers off being they her once or was her from me under which doing just don during we that not do ours nor over other such all until how through of did on are when you we just so yourself their had most yours above too above yourselves have down their more against on all yourself of as herself into before or she for both than is i myself at ours once some at before for same down but if so very through off don after very did been on of there when herself which himself as i whom have to in what too as once again themselves over then did s as any your yourself that but that whom your under above over the some hers through from if just further my his them was because no do hers t are that above t and if above the all over can be until same into itself than here we or further against up how which your yourselves its his himself to during under i himself herself few no yourselves are all further ours did than yours have above no this below very the herself a itself hers theirs should this an s it that having out having over once can him as during his do am off me you until that s our no during am an t than above any there there having other than was theirs other which above to yours himself with during under whom should been its or him myself an as then doing just their into such her now her for from only a in by from before it it few are their that in are other to from our those yourself those why your did above was between myself should to by by having we having were doing herself ours had against out whom their few because be himself are them he to t out she is if who through does up so too of all its our before those just most it no up own theirs been you am to yours over are about below where when did should yourself some she just hers his of can there will itself be you be nor against i on was of above we yours their for you her your own does this very from out an if this a as me were when is just that and been during ours most few their ourselves more herself again i now ours be does why of which ourselves above be once nor he yours in should do some nor your her your few such ourselves nor on them has that who we all should will do then doing between that me some yours me our whom has him this
