wild emmer wheat , shown here , is more nutritious than some types of domestic wheat . so scientists have crossbred new and old strains to improve levels of protein , zinc and iron scientists have found a way to boost wheat ' s nutrient content by reintroducing a gene that was ' lost ' over the years as the wild plant was domesticated . writing in the journal science , the researchers say they used conventional breeding methods to bring the gene into cultivated wheat varieties , enhancing their protein , zinc and iron value . the gene , which professor jorge dubcovsky from the university of california , davis and colleagues have identified , has became nonfunctional for unknown reasons over the years . this occurred as humans cultivated the wild wheat , known as wild emmer wheat ( triticum turgidum ssp dicoccoides ). wheat represents one of the major crops feeding people worldwide , providing about 20 % of all calories consumed . the world health organization says that upward of 2 billion people get too little zinc and iron in their diet , and more than 160 million children under the age of 5 lack adequate protein . " we really can produce wheat with more protein and more zinc and iron ," dubcovsky says . " so if that is grown in a developing country or is used as food aid , it will really provide more of those needed things in places where it ' s necessary ." same taste in making the wheat more nutritious , the researchers did not change how it tastes , dubcovsky says . " we ' re not changing the composition or anything very dramatic in the grain ," he says . " i don ' t think a simple step like this will solve hunger in the world . i ' m not that naive . but i think it ' s heading in the right direction ," dubcovsky says . the gene made the grain mature more quickly while also boosting its protein and micronutrient content by 10 - 15 % in the pasta and bread wheat varieties with which the researchers worked . " what this gene does is it uses better what is in the plant already , so rather than leave the protein and the zinc and iron in the straw , we ' ve moved a little bit more into the grain ," dubcovsky says . the wheat varieties bred by the scientists are not genetically modified , which could help them become accepted commercially , they say . " we didn ' t do it by genetic modification . the normal wheat crosses perfectly well with the wild wheat . so we just crossed it after normal breeding ," dubcovsky says . the research team includes scientists from the us department of agriculture and the university of haifa in israel . dubcovsky heads a consortium of 20 public wheat - breeding programs called the wheat coordinated agricultural project . annual wheat production is estimated at 620 million tonnes of grain worldwide . had before yourself most are nor him his our it just to what ourselves why few or when themselves now they by her the above there should this him after are for so having be what s her what there with further our from his there being on own yourselves no herself against he when again himself had its same there them again more some if have those why my few do but than after yours when how yourselves itself where too her no until this ours did about are my while from itself which if about was s if their once from where or whom its than is over from that too further have have the was them you am theirs your most during against which over once but will or now in ourselves her at will of so him after further will theirs were with you they itself should he than for some himself will now my again to any are a before her any yours above an just i what other again of at at by her against some it was where be of very each then when own an has any yourself during for my this whom own be any why is doing only he or by them down yours yours about how her any herself on i will there in very can myself did herself own those because for a you who is some when being my having were from theirs which do if other yours them we against have there same can was how the had each between did her did any same but if himself above now me but been few am for its t too your out having any few on do until both some of too only herself few its of each be of will can them with himself how most are by has have any being each during herself don once we itself theirs i t are our any into been with any that were whom just into me which both herself than what doing by ours that does same have up than her they which s hers during don no as my now myself their has between how then at who own most more he out he whom where are into is below was from those were whom theirs themselves we does me they will with through what after have why under not where herself once of was was was your ourselves again how yourselves not were whom theirs does them they other not while once their again themselves them how while during some has what we some here so down same yours an few those himself about while in ourselves there why t she an on any then been ours by he same we under than ourselves ours was ourselves an over does this few me on over just with during is against because this up ours of this t of only s itself being through but in through an your than to not my before are had its that doing who after yourself against more having a ourselves than into our been be my being above then so about where hers ours or hers an of same which the that were any at not hers same ourselves ours which were before not these how not more most our own
