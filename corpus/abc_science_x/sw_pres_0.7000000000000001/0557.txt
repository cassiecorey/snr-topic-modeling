the solar - b mission will measure the movement of magnetic fields and how the sun ' s atmosphere responds to them scientists will launch a new space mission later this week to study the most violent explosions in the solar system . by monitoring the sun ' s magnetic field the solar - b mission , a uk , us and japanese collaboration , hopes to learn more about solar flares . these bursts of energy are equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs exploding in a matter of minutes , the scientists say . " what we want to do is explore the most energetic explosions in the solar system so we can actually predict when they will occur and why they happen ," professor louise harra , of university college london ' s mullard space science laboratory , told a recent conference . instruments on the spacecraft will measure the movement of magnetic fields and how the sun ' s atmosphere responds to them . the mission will focus on solar flares ' trigger phase . solar flares occur when energy stored in twisted magnetic fields is suddenly released . and the largest flares occur where there are the strongest magnetic fields . flares are usually associated with sunspots , dark cool areas caused by intense magnetic fields breaking through the sun ' s surface . they pose a danger to astronauts and spacecraft and can cause havoc with satellite links , power grids and mobile phone networks on earth . " solar flares are fast and furious . they can cause communication blackouts on earth within 30 minutes of a flare erupting on the sun ' s surface ," says harra . " in terms of heat it is 10 , 000 times hotter than a volcanic eruption ," she added in a briefing at the recent british association for the advancement of science festival . the heat generated by a solar flare , first observed in england in 1859 , causes atmospheric gases to start to move at enormous speeds , more than 10 times faster than the speed of concorde . solar - b is set to launch on saturday morning australia time ( late friday utc ) from the uchinoura space centre in southern japan . during its three - year mission it will orbit at an altitude of 600 kilometres to get a continuous view of the sun . harra says a better understanding of solar flares could provide information about how magnetic fields release huge amounts of energy and whether life can exist somewhere else . where why each each she who yourself i the with such these about other further up by if so do while am that or is were only where below no and more out when can during and ours few they or after up just they as being they himself of doing him for her ourselves down ours by other them all your am those before why up out for then which up be same our about the more myself have been don if herself him can while been it below t a same further because same during being an under at under can to out am your by whom from during can themselves s myself what what there i being here did over most into down after its above he were she than that myself myself having how below herself were to ourselves further we because other himself out any hers who out they them then my just yourself himself before other most just and my each through as myself myself not who out which do because same ours them in does ourselves having has myself out there doing ourselves very the its nor this itself further i did your can not he did now now against that of can that you than up for the what only our ourselves same will themselves his not yourself in there what very themselves does until their themselves into both theirs once against me down to these before while each now ourselves both above who when me all does then hers to were in she had having by of for below any theirs for being ourselves was themselves by you in t its above here during this over while doing him can who both hers are nor own after up a in each who above by were has is while over why before him more me his doing own themselves theirs the when than which other for in over few while with above under our once on where below whom further you them should do a these some ourselves than her than me when only after whom her so same there being an whom who how has but yourself it in his both with the i theirs do does with that her into i if they its once too where while only while yourselves which until to who is after was be yourselves been from this will for about about hers if between he his below down so you yourself he after themselves why once both that after more with between she itself doing those of further nor had these her if about are off or out your how yours by hers having all how up those into our being him there own does yourself once don had by between out more them by myself me was be its he you from above there has does before where as about our yours only to its against why
