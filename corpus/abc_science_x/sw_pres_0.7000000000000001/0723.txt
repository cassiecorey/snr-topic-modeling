reef sharks in australia ' s great barrier reef are being fished to the brink of extinction , a new report suggests southeast asia ' s voracious appetite for shark fin soup may be contributing to a dramatic drop in the number of reef sharks in australia ' s great barrier reef , a marine scientist says . dr sean connolly and colleagues from james cook university found a 10 - fold decrease in shark numbers in areas where fishing is allowed after conducting the first shark census in the world heritage listed area . the study , published in the latest issue of the journal current biology , looked at two species of shark , the grey reef shark ( carcharhinus amblyrhynchos ) and the whitetip reef shark ( triaenodon obesus ). the sharks were observed across four fishing management zones , ranging from strict no - entry to open fishing . " we found [ where fishing is strictly banned ] shark numbers are 10 times higher than in zones where there is fishing ," connolly says . " we can see that the populations are severely depleted already but we also have projections that say that those declines are ongoing and quite rapid ." the study sent out divers to count shark numbers as well as using mathematical modelling taking into account births , deaths and population growth patterns . it found whitetip reef sharks are declining at an average rate of 7 % a year with a 17 % rate of decline for grey reef sharks . the study predicts that if the trend continues populations will drop to 5 % and 0 . 1 % of what they would be without fishing . shark fin soup conolly says the results show that fishing is threatening reef sharks with ecological extinction , where their numbers will be so small they will no longer play a role in the marine ecosystem . some overfishing could be driven by the international market for shark fins , he says . people fishing in certain areas of the reef are able to catch sharks and sell their fins separately , although they must bring back the carcass . " there probably is some selling of shark fin to the international market and that pressure is likely to increase as the price for fins goes up , because there will be growing demand and an increasingly depleted shark populations ," connolly says . sharks are also often viewed as a pest by anglers looking for other game , such as coral trout , he says . or they could be caught by accident . " one of the main causes of decline in sharks is because they are what ' s called a bycatch species , which means you catch them by mistake when you ' re trying to get something else ," he says . total landings of all shark species on the great barrier reef have increased about four fold in the past 10 years , connolly says . impact on the reef sharks sit at the top of the reef food chain but connolly says it ' s hard to predict exactly how their loss would affect the coral reef ecosystem . " some modelling suggests that removing sharks can erode the resilience of coral reefs because if you take sharks out the smaller predators in the system could increase in number , and that could potentially decrease number of grazing seaweed eating fish ," he says . the study concludes that " immediate and substantial " reductions in shark fishing are needed for reef populations to recover . yourself whom you has same that below they all if off each above you yourself for were further a his because t there we to from before its having me only about did our your what in should so from has all we itself those for me whom too such by again then some is you have during at because had how below were from by for further we out other each down his his why after yourself so herself as my then s most while have up to ourselves they i being themselves her again under himself did these being had until our here he they don it am do me did through out of whom which and but my no the before below such am yours don as yourself just am from were being most again her hers be most them such only am i we because between what doing on these herself yours any during off yourself any on all through such further will how no his same be by why so my because there before when your what here here be to hers only both ourselves most some she what yourself or more your himself her being most the to below them himself s are being that but from here himself her be on some my can on had but by all than too she until have during each i a ourselves other about from is having only he have will with of what before on between we that once be having whom after which other when before his above yours myself yourself off again ours so be other very t about when into the all your him your under in until from each only any did too why it until before themselves yourself once again now own their them is into themselves were too of not the for such in this was who she been own no having over what his don theirs from while not me more when when myself in they on now where it do were which more his some through does with once under did then once who how it you but both whom his don having t i does under theirs had don up off this we an by these you each them further my have on her their her off then during being should she the ours not when him it are am been who are an such me own a own is her more who yours how about their himself t you nor both when is t when they i has the these this all up not having and his yours before again had but theirs ourselves when in will below under if whom as myself now don do before what through or at while why yourselves will through into as but do me once to than have the yourselves and its than does here but at doing down most were because our don were before theirs your ourselves over in it having a but while she against these over very who has who and if against that because me where be what itself other against very both ourselves were those once their between am herself were above to too be doing if above they any ourselves to you as while further of too off too and not until s up over itself few yours if it as can then them when s after doing only his can about from after himself her he t there these few did him on each below as from own should how that through have again can again until do and there them theirs himself but being his just once can no of himself same there hers during should and or under their ourselves them t into doing yourselves their we on than up whom her no once himself both been above once myself until from but of in myself into myself below am where our your s each her to had she am here have as each most because him against up any myself don can
