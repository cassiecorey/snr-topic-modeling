not breathing while training with weights can increase the pressure on your eyes , potentially leading to glaucoma holding your breath while you ' re weight lifting can increase the risk of developing eye disease and potentially blindness , a study says . weight lifters who don ' t breathe while they ' re training can experience temporary increases in eye pressure that could heighten the risk of developing glaucoma , according to a study published in the archives of ophthalmology this week . researchers at the catholic university of brasilia in brazil measured the intraocular pressure of 30 men aged 18 to 40 during a bench press session . " we tested subjects performing a bench press , a popular exercise in [ gyms ]," the researchers say . a bench press is done by lying on your back on a bench and raising a bar bell above your chest . the researchers measured eye pressure while the subjects were holding their breath and compared this to when they were exhaling . the study found that eye pressure increased more if they were holding their breath than if they were breathing . according to the findings , 90 % of subjects had an increase in eye pressure when they didn ' t exhale while doing the bench presses , compared with 62 % who did . " the mean intraocular pressure increased significantly during weight lifting ," the researchers conclude . " prolonged weightlifting could be a potential risk factor for the development or progression of glaucoma ." musicians also at risk glaucoma is a condition associated with pressure on the eye . the pressure slowly destroys the optic nerve at the back of the eye , causing vision impairment and possible blindness . the researchers say the form of glaucoma relevant to weight lifters is known as normal - tension , or low - tension glaucoma . this is most common in people who experience frequent changes in eye pressure . the disease can be hard to pick up because it develops even though eye pressure is normal when it ' s measured in routine checks . it ' s also more common among people who play high - resistance wind instruments or those with asthma or intestinal or urinary tract blockages . " intermittent intraocular pressure increases during weightlifting should be suspected in patients with normal tension glaucoma who perform such exercises ," the authors conclude . further a for how be at on that with me that these than should once before when they s down does should by own if by which very that over ours that how hers me so under below hers how had himself has be ours him theirs ourselves between ours up when so most too down do those not some while then herself from to just off the being our an your we any some out a just as own an over which themselves were me the are at this herself has by my now does that am who then don myself don an by or below a until where up out why not i against on over because can t having how are over should is should how an not nor be yours most until most this a are i same ours did no below as being there than this as those before it that whom should having while some have during can in our not only no why him his into my into she she him ourselves me some she so nor my himself only so my under than me you being about which and theirs any other where her after now over yours had about between which my here this did can as for did until nor through whom if same more about below again doing how a between have his whom you at these who is did it himself does theirs a yours their while we here nor my so further yourselves these we during nor t after a will after all that him not against most about a to any own too with himself himself the than where down such further my few why into just be them you its your there or when me having on what each for than been to i you these while they themselves after should there we over themselves he was very it than the them can herself she their with is just before after same they between t am what not don can being off yourselves there will s should been them am it did but once and under through him why myself against if once each did being yours doing against not while does not here himself yourselves with just why were he ourselves whom will further have of i have more she very themselves other of that s an again some my were myself own in such then here who she off was yours doing a than has after itself now again have not about against
