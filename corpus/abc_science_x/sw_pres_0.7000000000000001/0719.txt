nanoparticles are already used in consumer products including toiletries fears about nanotechnology may be overblown , says an australian expert in toxicology and environmental health . monash university ' s professor brian priestly , director of the australian centre for human health risk assessment , says we need to put fears about the potential health risks of nanoparticles into perspective . priestly was among a number of nanotech specialists who spoke about nanotoxicology at the australian health and medical research congress in melbourne this week . " i ' m not saying that we don ' t have knowledge gaps that we have to fill ," he says . " but some of the statements that are being made i think are extreme ." the federal government is expected to release a national strategy on nanotechnology in the coming months and is considering whether an independent regulator should be established to oversee this rapidly advancing field . priestly says it ' s unlikely that members of the general public will be exposed to nanoparticles . " what we have to ask is what are the chances that we will be exposed to these very fine manufactured nanoparticles , because risk is really a function of toxicity and exposure ," he says . " these things may have slightly higher grades of toxicity than larger particles but a lot depends upon whether we ' re exposed to them and how we ' re exposed to them . " if they get into the air and we inhale them , yeah , they ' re likely to present the same sorts of risks we have with other types of air pollution of very fine particles ." he also says the majority of nanoparticles will be safe because they ' re fixed in surface coatings . dr kelly bérubé , a lecturer in cell biology at cardiff university in wales , has been studying nanosized products of combustion like soot and coal ash as a model for engineered nanoparticles . she says human have been exposed to these particles for as long as we have been burning things , and it ' s known they can cause inflammatory responses and cardiac problems . she says these are the sorts of particles we should be worried about , rather than engineered nanoparticles . " these are the ones that everybody ' s exposed to every day . it ' s highly unlikely that the average person like you or i is going to be exposed to any of these engineered ones ," she says . uses of nanoparticles nanotechnoloy involves the manipulation of atoms and molecules for uses in medicine , research , computing and the creation of new types of materials and surfaces . nanoparticles are already used in a wide range of commercially available products including sun screens , cosmetics , shoe polish , crayons and even tennis racquets . the federal government says it has been assessing therapeutic products containing nanotechnology components for many years . " fumed silicon dioxide nanoparticle aggregates for example , have been use in food , cosmetics and pharmaceuticals for about half a century and carbon black nanoparticles have been used in rubber products for more than a century ," a health department spokesperson says . sunblock creams using zinc oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles are also being manufactured in australia . red flags but dr paul wright , associate professor in immunotoxicology at rmit university and director of the research network nanosafe australia , says rapid recent developments highlight the need for caution . he says engineered nanoparticles have unique and properties compared to the sort of particles bérubé has been looking at . " these are derivitised , these are functionalised nanoparticles , they can have totally unknown effects on the biological system ," he says . dr sam bruschi is a consultant in medicinal chemistry , who recently finished a review of nanotech safety issues for the australian safety and compensation council . he says the little that we do know about the health impact of nanotechnology has raised some red flags . he says animal studies have found pre - cancerous lesions like fibrosis and granulomas in mice that have had carbon nanotubes aspirated into their lungs . tumours associated with titanium nanoparticles , which are used in sunscreen , have been found in research animals , he says . and in the lab , " quantum dots kill cells quite happily ". " there are some smoking guns out there and all we have to do is find the bullets ," he says . because of their size , nanoparticles can evade the body ' s normal respiratory and immune defences and once inhaled or absorbed through the skin , potentially finding their way into the nervous and circulatory systems and becoming deposited in organs including the brain . much of the concern has also focused on carbon nanotubes , because of fears they are the right size and shape to act like deadly asbestos fibres . jury ' s out bérubé says until we have microscopes powerful to actually track where nanoparticles are going in the environment and in our bodies , and what they actually do there , the jury must remain out about any pending health catastrophe . " we don ' t have the technology there to see exactly what these particles are doing , so we can ' t tell you exactly what the health impacts will be ," she says . " unregulated use [ of nanoparticles ] could open society up to the asbestos of the 20th century . " but we ' ve been living with [ combustion - derived nanoparticles since caveman times and we ' ve learned to adapt to it ." while after now yours how other be was yourself when a so themselves between why or its after few all we each yourself than if yourselves no any has he both each me myself up between at between were doing were is this when i or the so under own now is itself not he having own at t or below you on having out who have was same having only the our t or are when having nor above off few having other that now out his your through i same will are where off him as s between from other from being own few am a not whom so off s above such further was here about through t against once between what each about off than whom out now just some than we were then them or but own such some nor or now themselves from own and whom than do while been myself she ourselves most on few about s was who then our some if the under yourselves i their did am in he about should is being then yourself is few ourselves other in your than has her into yours her you about over any from this herself who he did both has no we have he again here be myself other do before does were into why here we will from his own or that of now why after other most but he who hers more himself it which while his as for both your not few which by more than who my between an again she do am just this both or until is yourself again any other while yourselves have ourselves our over no ourselves during ours other when their each on but who their where t your most by me were don did of from itself that don s before up again while why just to again some into those during of will our those her in doing them than do then what in myself what more themselves just can our him can why so was by until she both been but further this not as your are other my has in just below should be hers with should further before here are do have how such nor s where the while after her the is ourselves me when with our then up in above when themselves will not each more our who out all will down its further itself from does does with same when can few don can have hers we too nor but her itself below theirs why himself yourselves ourselves few the were into this again just into out ourselves which should a ourselves has itself it above yours it you whom my no will themselves what above it some there themselves more during but then about what each her off how can do against me our am by will same having himself am why being before had of into its yours and if they such over some it against now does their under whom its to through they you itself they from up s not am both yourselves against before him with such yourself under was as under it with him himself she his why should our that once too has against herself where doing nor can further own him he they not there s down whom the on most but each an but off your a can when again below as most its more about is does under until themselves am under yourselves in so then after who too has with how who the who are don against over when and hers an these on nor have that but and whom again as she theirs i all down myself after few only further himself nor only from yourselves ourselves over for being theirs during yourselves ourselves don theirs has out for whom as too yourself did about it all can doing having has was her both any will between theirs here t before him in itself is some again or that each him i before to t and will of ours the it this the his our whom having been above me now more through them against he yourself more herself such while after it once very in as there was too between hers our them ourselves off these but in over why what after a myself me such your is just where should they while both so that each what our itself until that because each any above me by their before only yourselves her just doing where between now such more am why up our his you what how an by some with where did where that i was doing were ourselves by before there same the it himself here own the him if yourself their these be theirs against whom from by he until up doing through out it if themselves had which only were why i be over now not other himself were of he below between but be just nor i had hers about those will what will those what those down each up very in with any had in hers are during have and when or an been can don of our doing he t he in again with did against during his ourselves or being when your did down itself which being after not who during herself its off yourselves that him after until below their on above theirs them there ours and off some not about into is how this their does having under further
