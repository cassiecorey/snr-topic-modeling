the mass extinction known as the great dying 250 million years ago had profound and lasting effects on marine life . the upper part of the image represents life before the mass extinction , the lower part afterwards about 95 % of the earth ' s marine species and 70 % of its land species were wiped out during a mass extinction about 250 million years ago , according to australian and us researchers . this event , which occurred at the end of the permian age and is known as the great dying , fundamentally changed which species survived in the world ' s oceans . and scientists at james cook university in townsville , queensland and the field museum in chicago warn that modern human - induced changes to the ecosystem could have a similar impact . the researchers report in today ' s issue of the journal science how they came across the culling of species while examining figures on the numbers of marine life forms in communities over the past 540 million years . simple species that did not move or search for food were largely wiped out , they conclude . more complex life forms such as crabs and snails that went looking for food took over . the biological devastation occurred when the earth was believed to have had only one continent , surrounded by a single ocean . the researchers did not go into what caused the mass extinction . but using a new palaeobiology database , they gave what they say are the most exhaustive details ever assembled of its effect . ' ecologically simple ' species such as stationary shells and other forms that filtered food out of the water were replaced by complex communities , mobile species such as crabs and clams . " we think these are the first analyses of this type at this large scale ," says dr peter wagner , associate curator of fossil invertebrates at the field museum and lead author of the study , who worked with dr matthew kosnik of james cook university . " they show that the end - permian mass extinction permanently altered not just taxonomic diversity but also the prevailing marine ecosystem structure ," wagner says . the results of the study could provide a warning on how we treat the ecosystem now , the experts say . " studies by modern marine ecologists suggest that humans are reducing certain marine ecosystems to something reminiscent of 550 million years ago , prior to the explosion of animal diversity ," wagner says . " the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs couldn ' t manage that ." as hers if out such by with through don doing from between our those this ourselves further after but do being after yourself same until are did while can be between all the if my theirs because itself who be because s just should with and below in do does so they some a our myself at a on have him to so which as after for some not can that they most this above they herself too as very them both out be should once did very him through once is she so who very these itself over off i it having by before to what theirs are same been t their if such himself too am which only which those yourselves above she once her did them nor he his any theirs a them when our on were herself doing how most where can but those ours more does by this our be by he where too when out i other any and the by as having into why nor of not above no yourselves nor more her this this and such to which again its on at am what it are these further having so not only under i it has t before were at or to out this yourself an to t all you why were all between t theirs as for some yourself had against between hers them nor being above yours a it she now we you for both same into you t itself what itself been again very how some until being they by not some here myself her been below yours t all or whom i being does he my has there further yourselves over not themselves him have s that each have at at nor theirs as the to hers from ourselves these against up me to same not or does they himself was a over does was to while during was don both he against further all with only they in yourself don whom am not being have our in themselves he or again against which or about s don being theirs too some most should both will i am been am how its who until a if how only does more no above few where all himself ours these than its here myself above whom under both we no this has myself so whom a through own such above had who all own some a theirs am when very here your yourself to under into before same are these they an above he not theirs own was who who no above off this with off any yours who between and most theirs have your our off to very we only do do those under as under there him a most very itself to same will than are to but over them all having the before once should yourself
