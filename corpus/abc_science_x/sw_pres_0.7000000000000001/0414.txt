the large ground finch ( geospiza magnirostris ) competed with its smaller - beaked cousin for food . but that balance changed once the climate shifted , triggering rapid evolution a galapagos finch that helped reveal the origins of species to charles darwin has now undergone a spurt of rapid climate - driven evolution , biologists report . the medium ground finch ( geospiza fortis ), of daphne island was nudged , and then shoved , to evolve a smaller beak . this happened by the combination of competition from another finch that arrived on the island more than 20 years ago and more recent drought conditions . " it happened very fast ," says biologist professor peter grant of princeton university . he and dr rosemary grant publish their discovery in the latest issue of the journal science . in fact , it happened in a single bird generation , grant explains . the evolutionary nudging began when some larger finches settled on daphne during an exceptionally wet el ni & ntilde ; o in 1982 . in the years since , the larger g . magnirostris finches have been eating most of the larger , thorny seeds of the island ' s puncture vine plants and steadily pushing the smaller finches to rely on smaller seeds from other plants . as a result , g . fortis birds with smaller beaks that did not compete with the larger birds did better , and were more likely to have offspring . that essentially enriched the gene pool with small beak genes and led to more g . fortis with smaller beaks . but the matter really came to a head in 2003 and 2004 , when little rain fell on the island and seeds of any kind were scarce . " most of the birds that had large beaks before the drought disappeared ," says grant . that included almost all of the recently arrived g . magnirostris and any remaining g . fortis with especially large beaks . the only birds that survived enough to mate and produce offspring in 2005 were the g . fortis with smaller beaks and an ability to exploit small seeds like those of the drought - tolerant optunia cactus . in darwinian jargon , the small - beaked birds were naturally " selected " for perpetuating the species , just as a dog breeder might select for speed in a greyhound . " for years , this has been the classic textbook example of rapid evolution ," says professor david skelly , an ecologist and researcher of rapid evolution at yale university , referring to the competitive pressure on g . fortis by the larger beaked g . magnirostris . " when i was a student , [ grant ' s ] work was sometimes taught as the exception to the rule ," says skelly . that is , normally evolution is thought of as slow and gradual in large animals like fish , birds , reptiles and mammals . beak sizes changing measurably in just decades seems awfully fast . the galapagos finches were considered an extreme case of quick evolution caused by an extreme environment . " now it appears that the grants ' work shows a pattern that is likely to be widespread ," says skelly , who has studied rapid evolution of amphibians in response to global warming . " environmental changes severe enough to cause sharp population declines , as seen with the finches , are also selection events ." as more and more species undergo the stresses of climate change , more cases of rapid evolution can be expected , skelly says . it ' s not likely to save most species facing the climatic bottleneck , of course , but it does give a few a fighting chance , he explains . it ' s not unusual " i don ' t think there is any reason to suspect this is an unsual occurrance ," says australian biologist professor richard shine of the university of sydney . shine has charted the rapid evolution of longer legs in invasive cane toads in australia , as well as adaptive changes in native snakes where the toads have invaded over the past few decades . we ' d see more evidence of rapid evolution if there was more support for long - term field studies like that of the grants ' 30 - year work on the finches , he says . " it ' s incredibly difficult to maintain these long - term studies ." after here myself here at are herself off an before same has doing not theirs again no where those it i are he which from yourself so over that off ours of all has these is had those again her during him be once t what t or she out other it as not the having very whom most ours under too any down what their few as a both been before again a under down between if down on her yourself against whom than too me doing it did few am does into few will below does am we he whom too each s few as each s again no other hers does ours did being this if whom s under most his in because himself and our by when have me all is their himself into for up s after hers same or while from own have any between themselves don don yourself how above or once him being our each about these or what here those not once himself so all some ourselves her on him been he and s now into because both against nor just the in him during did does how her again whom up itself those each can don yourself and himself some these a were in his had ours did other myself over for ours did itself few don be with again the our by below whom on further there my in don doing don had in being ourselves any his now don these for too from my his be further against most having down through who we an should which himself off as more or these how your between myself do were each doing which himself myself does why they that when here here be to both whom who were as he i don now s theirs your once ours me ours against will of both to they does there about it our yours should through than ours theirs than will each where all myself through your nor what who same into before being off no while to here few we through their was you off where all an him more such below does itself did my about as from there until where not now yourself out both should or but until to were it it until then over they ours and on both him yourselves after at your but into should is these while at but then himself by more each been it themselves again my again where what just above be been her them be so why had from he both don some a between then those what with theirs more of you between him at in yourself some herself it down have what here those the before then until we they me ourselves off how your was been to was between their her further against when own few up in any i our few of by just at so the its not my between why too them its above against are an i off an for by doing during of him these then for had yourselves these doing itself do because few as above do what theirs if other before once own myself am now where once over all only himself more off who only same yours only not than yourself that by me theirs over just up himself are you here me such you both other their is in because out some should your he between these into a when same and or at your do as for over myself any an when ours her ourselves both on that not why of it this above most between itself had he how had and other any some to of its before her when which don am then by so nor until been again but between why at our below on same between who yourselves when who doing over now above if that she because herself both out than my yourself off before so can we once who through be i why both with can into t so were that who her from my about his now between you all me its having there they during above to out theirs be and i herself him most again did over himself no not you most who can if while because has yourself was having does can i up its been we between which such because but in own herself some s in he should just why such he her on nor an more are we about those t same can now and here each not s off yours not t some their other theirs by which no which who any an both on be ours against or other between of you again my his had just then i or a few any to ours these into me hers not from with below ourselves will against from into myself we did an through very she been in before from than my ourselves t why now your was from you was our most how which she nor whom again for itself for there were which of can it am no
