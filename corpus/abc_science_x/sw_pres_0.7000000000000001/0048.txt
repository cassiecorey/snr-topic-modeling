neanderthals used their knowledge of animal behaviour to hunt mountain goats like these caucasian turs , just like early humans did neanderthals did not disappear because modern humans were better hunters and thus out - competed them for resources , say us and israeli anthropologists . on the contrary , they were top predators who knew how to hunt the biggest and fastest of the animals . neanderthals went extinct about 30 , 000 years ago , after having inhabited europe and parts of asia for roughly 200 , 000 years . the reason for their demise has been long debated and frequently attributed to modern humans ' greater intelligence and consequently greater hunting skills . but evidence from animal remains hunted by neanderthals clearly indicates these hominids were as good as any early modern humans at hunting , report daniel adler , an assistant professor and palaeoanthropologist at the university of connecticut , and colleagues in the february issue of the journal current anthropology . the researchers examined abundant faunal remains , in particular thousands of bones belonging to a mountain goat species called the caucasian tur that still exists today . the trove was excavated at ortvale klde , a rock shelter in the southern caucasus in the republic of georgia dated to between 60 , 000 and 20 , 000 years ago . evidence of killing there was no doubt that the animals were hunted and killed . indeed , the bones featured cut marks from human butchering and fragmentations typical of marrow consumption , showing that meat processing behaviours were not significantly different between neanderthals and modern humans . " given the abundance of animals , one might think that neanderthals would kill as many animals as possible , regardless of age , and therefore nutritional returns ," says adler . but analysis of tooth wear revealed that two - thirds of the animals were animals of prime age , the strongest , fastest , most nutritious and most difficult to capture members of the herd . " neanderthals , like the modern humans that followed them , were quite savvy , choosing instead to maximise their dietary intake per energy expended by hunting prime age adults . " given the species involved and the rough terrain , this would require sophisticated hunting tactics , [ and ] knowledge of animal behaviour , in particular migration routes and flight behaviour , and group cooperation ," adler says . expert timing neanderthals timed their hunts for late autumn to early spring , during the caucasian tur ' s seasonal migration to lower elevations , where the site of ortvale klde is located . " they maintained an intimate relationship with their environment and were capable of understanding exactly where and when particular resources could be found in abundance ," adler says . archaeologist john shea , an associate professor at stony brook university says : " the study is excellent , precisely what is needed : a comparison of how neanderthals and modern humans used the same landscape close enough in time so that any differences discovered reflect behavioural differences and not environmental ones ." still a mystery shea believes that multiple factors , varying from region to region , may have played a role in the disappearance of neanderthals . " the simple answer to the question of why neanderthals became extinct is ' nobody knows '. but studies like this one certainly move us a lot closer to being able to make more clearly testable hypotheses ," he says . " now the hypothesis that neanderthals became extinct because they were ineffective hunters is in deep trouble ." itself which herself i by against while there of from here or than it further we have so we can our down any most into out into too myself than same me its s his other ourselves their then out be my was so and its her down if don by have down ourselves few after just we same it which up off on about other we again again did did can it above will my yours at more as herself your can has she same ours he below down of does at against off their who s some this been be further she or during has its during until on where don both out have about its each below down am them during further itself but by do so up how your did when ours me own then some any over yourself he both itself no were who before and that a he at what up it any while herself does ourselves between through below ours same out is on under his she only out through to on above any is can as himself himself few only yourselves whom no each most to does so out theirs same other such him now can has herself here about just there each off further about be she so has by the that those against most a t same theirs when further your yourself yourself while do each them the me yourselves then ours being all other you should whom for before where that are is how under only their just again own i against you any for my yourself our by both doing most me but more below from further ours to now s yourselves off those don s further here during their but own you yours have my theirs yourselves theirs between herself here now themselves if he all then few what does below at only so against which than only can been s then they be now here where how being so we are was while by out do his other be most yours will so did where same yours too under once such until each too have t they being up did her themselves did don so there under was who against up its who myself was each ours do did now up more these while she over my under whom does its his now s is on to how through am with having am on them other theirs with now her yourselves are below with because where a our other no all because will up while or do of yourself here because about of your an just they will a each those so t be against did on in we being i down until will where t so have or all own by at you each having other because having who for below on themselves herself did what his can myself can his out does he there don if we can hers how my our above itself how don most itself yourself are into yourselves don out again herself than doing her an theirs each are there their your do ours yourselves no very than himself in while them not there so too but its from if s being or been my until himself been once why my was he yours all then from the until you more now to having and through further of at nor any very some or her other am where so against herself through further during just hers during some when has further more that under yours over be am having have an than few after yours out my its most their hers did before it only because himself on its itself through from you them about should having about more own both down have what t who out it those now being him more should just about we and will when off this each then above its a just after you she do below further can hers not we too it here he some off that during am themselves s but in own below so most during this such am how on most having will her because in on while further such t herself down you having up the before there have here he very ourselves theirs the more this was during all have its ourselves under into ourselves some other the don under s such don not them very been him through no herself i were am very until himself
