the last neanderthals holed up in gibraltar , a refuge on the balmy southern tip of europe , until their lineage withered away , scientists say neanderthals lived in southern europe as recently as 28 , 000 years ago , had a varied diet and used sophisticated tools and weapons , scientists say . homo neanderthalensis was thought to have survived in europe until the arrival of modern humans about 30 , 000 years ago . but new findings by professor clive finlayson of the gibraltar museum show the two groups may have coexisted in europe for 4000 years or longer . " we are showing quite clearly that they survived at the very least until 28 , 000 years ago and possibly as recently as 24 , 000 years . that is significantly later than previously thought ," finlayson says . with europe in the grip of an ice age and with their smarter cousins , homo sapiens , spreading across the continent , the last neanderthals holed up in a refuge on the balmy southern tip of europe until their lineage withered away , the study says . neanderthals were predecessors of modern humans who inhabited europe and parts of west and central asia . despite their image as club - carrying , hairy brutes , research suggests they were expert tool makers , used animal skins to keep warm and may have cared for each other . during a new excavation at gorham ' s cave , a rich source of prehistoric artefacts in gibraltar , finlayson found a campfire made by neanderthals and remains of tools , flint weapons and animal fossils . remains included those of mammals , birds and shellfish , finlayson says . charcoal found at the site enabled the scientists to date it . they were also able to reconstruct the environment in which the late neanderthals lived and found it included a variety of plants . " it indicates to us that in spite of the glaciations further up in europe , this was a place where the climate was still sufficiently mild for populations of neanderthals to survive quite late ," adds finlayson , whose findings are reported online by the journal nature . " the last neanderthals that occupied gorham ' s cave had access to a diverse community of plants and vertebrates on the sandy plains , open woodland and shrubland , wetlands , cliff and coastal environments surrounding the site ," the study says . " such ecological diversity might have facilitated their long survival ." the scientists are excavating further in the cave where stone tools were discovered more than 50 years ago . they will also be looking for neanderthal burial sites in the cave ' s deeper parts . co - existing with humans how long neanderthals and modern humans coexisted in the same geographical area is a subject of much debate , with some researchers suggesting it could have been as short as 2000 years . " here we are looking at 4000 years , if not more , and that is a long time " says finlayson . " it sounds like very little , but if you transpose it into human generations today , 4000 years is from the time of christ to the present and back ," he adds . what happened to neanderthals then ? as to the great whodunnit of palaeontology , the paper discounts the theory that these neanderthals were annihilated by h . sapiens in the competition for food and territory . evidence of stone - age technology at malaga , about 100 kilometres east of gibraltar , shows that anatomically modern man had ventured into the neighbourhood at the time when the neanderthals lived in gorham cave . this suggests that for several thousand years the region was a ' mosaic ' of remnant neanderthals and pioneering h . sapiens living in thinly - scattered communities . neanderthal dna in modern humans ? another theory to explain the disappearance of the neanderthals is that they did not disappear , not genetically , at any rate . under this hypothesis , neanderthals and h . sapiens co - mingled . far from being a dead branch of the human tree , the neanderthals may even have bequeathed some of the traits in the h . sapiens genome that we see today . the new paper does not address this controversial theory , but notes there is no evidence of " transitional " tools or activities at the cave . this adds weight to the argument that the last neanderthals had only limited contact with h . sapiens , so interbreeding was unlikely . the first evidence for the neanderthals emerged in 1856 , when workers at a lime quarry in the neander valley , western germany , came across bones initially thought to be that of a bear . since then , the remains of about 400 neanderthals have been found , at sites ranging from southern england to continental europe and the middle east . am
