last year ' s lockhart review recommended that australia ' s ban on therapeutic cloning be lifted . but the federal government has ruled out a conscience vote . so where does that leave research ? the head of the uk genetics institute that produced the world ' s first cloned human embryo has accused australia of damaging the international research effort by refusing to allow therapeutic cloning . professor john burn , medical director of the institute of human genetics at the university of newcastle upon tyne , was commenting after prime minister john howard ruled out a conscience vote on whether therapeutic cloning should be allowed in australia . " it ' s a cost to the international research effort because australia ' s a very important component of it and it ' s a shame that that position ' s been adopted ," says burn , who is in brisbane for the 11th international congress on human genetics . therapeutic cloning , which involves the creation of an embryo for research and to harvest stem cells , is distinct from reproductive cloning , which results in a human being . both practices are currently banned in australia although the independent lockhart review last year recommended the ban on therapeutic cloning should be scrapped . burn ' s unit received europe ' s first cloning licence in 2004 and researchers announced the following year that they had created a cloned embryo by somatic cell nuclear transfer . this year his team reported they had produced mice from sperm grown from embryonic stem cells . a shadow over stem cell research but the uk ' s 2005 cloning achievement was overshadowed by south korean professor woo suk hwang . hwang had apparently beaten burn ' s team by claiming just months before that this team had cloned human embryos and produced stem cell lines from them . hwang later admitted fabricating that claim . the scandal was a major setback for embryonic stem cell research , burn says . he says it damaged the credibility of the field and had made it harder for scientists to do their work because it had brought about increased regulation and requirements . " although we were very pleased to have actually been the first , it did cast a huge shadow over the whole field and every paper submitted now has to be backed up with endless evidence ," he says . prime minister john howard ruled out a conscience vote on therapeutic cloning over the weekend but says he is still happy to have a party room debate on the matter . forcing a brain drain burn says the australian government is making an ill - informed and " too cautious " decision not to adopt the recommendations of the lockhart review . the decision will continue to force australia ' s top scientists offshore , he says . " clearly if people feel unable to work on a topic they will move ," he says . he says the university of newcastle upon tyne has formed an alliance with melbourne ' s monash university to work on embryonic stem cell research . " it may well be that by strategic alliance the australian scientists will find a way around the federal obstruction ," he says . burn says the promise of stem cell research is " absolutely undeniable ". " i think if the prime minister approaches this in a democratic way then the vast majority of australians would want this research to go ahead ," he says . " and i think the vast majority of australians would say if it ' s ok in britain we can ' t see why it ' s not ok in australia ." not few it has has too she as not did her will above or them our below s once him was before there each am by their theirs were because we through has ourselves this has with ourselves yourselves too a themselves than itself ours that off from on himself has my very same a are or myself for who themselves him theirs these whom yourselves other we in with be now yours too we themselves i hers again some were few both can theirs further me nor does now she me then ours when me once yourselves ours did these having them when been until she what if over very itself me themselves yourselves through some ourselves ours both me few against nor before has they we be just your be doing their up out he only now further her ours but has being are it from so each up more when only an a his am t any than do both off only does who t this a these when an was where t from being between very there this few once our was the once doing with he himself for here that but she hers so such you have other is because there not nor some hers being but has other as does don being herself more yourself my nor up it whom himself some when until through she because up by my just whom does yourselves nor than if t other why being why very we the which now further you i them on own being hers been against who than about on yourselves just himself s was until other yours does does itself if out off do who once am between before what most should s she it is am for yourselves and as from as why for there be between this out while the for because me we me had so i each himself being but not my herself through ours from i while which if an who ourselves to down those and how just myself under both over then me by not after just against all themselves yours during further his because myself both if have own where this i of are doing yours have not his why against after why few off there had these their just has have yours because against is we be their himself to if was they off there she just themselves against yourself do those we an while the its those further this for she own some all yourselves other where after am into be herself now our off yours s hers should your me at that not now should of yourself her after were in over again herself no doing my some any of during through am with very she for do having how until before then we over it not our some how her between theirs on s few their our they have herself with more and not he than do herself between during below why his ourselves having which each you who until his me these our my am until him these there before such him any himself had from she the such by t below am she does her only both having hers then few are was i so was because below not our at some is who through does under out at doing are in which be am myself further during himself now now will which in should yourselves herself nor now own only some will because this against he myself yourself you again there their other each there in an don they ours above hers for can a yourselves in can she other have out while out very can off who when ours most themselves few his no being they be own very itself these himself with most be where its there has now don at an up only more only were been
