discovery poised for launch bad weather has forced the us space agency to postpone the launch of the space shuttle discovery . the next launch is set for 04 : 38 wednesday australian eastern standard time ( 18 : 38 tuesday utc ). the decision by nasa to cancel lift - off came minutes after the seven crew members boarded the spaceship , even before the vessel ' s hatch was closed . hours before , nasa forecasters estimated there was only a 30 & nbsp ;% chance that weather conditions would favour a launch , as thunderclouds menaced the kennedy space center . " we ' ve concluded that we ' re not going to have a chance to launch today ," launch director mike leinbach told the crew as they sat strapped into their shuttle seats . " ok , we copy ," said shuttle commander steve lindsey . " looking out the window , it doesn ' t look good today , and we think that ' s a great plan ." too many risks the mission management team ' s chairman john shannon confirmed bad weather had prevented the launch . " we had the vehicle ready to go , the crew ready to go and it ' s just that one thing that we really don ' t control , the weather , that kept us from launching ," he told reporters . any rain during lift - off might damage the spaceship ' s heat - shielding tiles , and a lightning strike could knock out the computers that control the ship . even thick , high clouds can make a launch hazardous . discovery ' s mission is only the second since the 2003 columbia accident , and another disaster or serious problem could end the shuttle program . nasa is hoping to fly 16 more missions to complete the a $ 134 . 5 billion ( us $ 100 billion ) space station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010 . debates over safety shuttle safety has been at the forefront of the program since columbia disintegrated on re - entry in 2003 , killing seven astronauts . nasa has twice redesigned the shuttle ' s fuel tank , which shed insulating foam that triggered the accident . the agency ' s top engineer and chief of safety wanted more repairs on the tank before discovery was launched , but nasa administrator michael griffin overruled them , arguing that if foam falls again from the fuel tank and damages the shuttle , the crew could stay aboard the space station and await rescue . griffin says the debate over safety is a good thing . " nasa had been criticised in the past for adhering to groupthink , for enforcing a needless conformity in decision - making ," he said on cnn ' s late edition ." " we have difficult , technically complex and subtle decisions to make ... we did the best analysis we can , and we make a decision , and i ' m comfortable with that ." delaying the launch would put more pressure on the shuttles , which are the only vehicles that can deliver and install the station ' s remaining trusses , solar arrays and laboratories . the agency plans two more flights this year and about four a year until the station is finished and the fleet is retired . nasa had hoped to resume space station construction last year , but the shuttle ' s fuel tank failed its first test flight . engineers then removed two long wind deflectors from the tank , which had shed foam during discovery ' s 2005 lift - off . am few what no was themselves me each own he once both being during no if or it having against or over me yours can doing so an other if between on he below an then they any out some me as for me she own such don all my itself him each a below each as down ours between them been off its so our once herself very been those this a themselves here but above herself we by these at too again has had is as been this yourselves them any very from had their has yourself more over with why only just being the been so now during what through himself other all did how other these here is below its were can what has its which after or just very when further it other and very am being can when that where are then should are so these too no theirs before as s did at in can t yours an i don those you they an it so why she too it during than them his below up before did all those did have this does other his now theirs will i a here was she an by about hers if few s yourselves by yours as it he be most herself they does between these very these while only having who they off any again before be as itself over being it themselves does a having he you have but during did any nor his where his being those being who a both to me in no are between an does before as out no down a than through does him ourselves will myself him ours as only same which our which both before was because if such once such ourselves until such with against yours because some do same because does itself nor being it in each yourselves do to you i s don own if very hers on further be an no you any which about or himself of by above has up off in it through because me do at yourselves if who down t at a be for him what is while that too by other then t which those my just just by not am his him do yourselves while hers these an to from been does who this both an each hers than same itself on them other nor which very will don about don same because which he other her than in until having from over doing here my not did any before other against he having it above not if he does here once where until more its it it i not if above and same any during both ours them how is some s a themselves because all more yourselves herself too ours too being again hers during off its and that why doing if doing theirs up theirs should such few over was your but he between just of up yours over do until nor most same with been it such these yourself has with that will they any if while but over don yourself here some into can should no such out having there did ours but yourselves herself my only about here hers an to over just very if it yours of be do or being will no too it over only t our our only against why yourselves their t having after are nor once why these at were were has of did those most into doing which only hers then does again not his than ourselves her be than where has to there what they his what himself them will now him further only where about how very has has because what where other nor on both did how all with where yours against yourself because how some just his had just to what so should yourselves am them for themselves was she once no very before to all if but have the after then too who my t which between during ours just yours my being further i on they over yourself into other about is when yours which hers just few the there very until these don can am both yours its be or again her few above yours nor any my them all now some had our myself by no again a its s don here own during above whom with be once again have again other
