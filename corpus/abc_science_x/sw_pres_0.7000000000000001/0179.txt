professor frederick short retrieving marked plants from australia ' s great barrier reef seagrasses around the world are in decline , according to a global study that says human impact is largely to blame . but australia ' s ' underwater forests ' in queensland have bucked the trend and are generally in good shape , the researchers find . seagrass beds are shallow water ecosystems , like a forest on the ocean floor . not only do they serve as protective nurseries for juvenile fish and shellfish , and a habitat and feeding ground for many marine species , they protect the coastline from currents and weather - related erosion . since 2001 , the university of new hampshire ' s professor frederick short and colleagues have been running the global monitoring program seagrassnet . this has involved monitoring seagrass health at 45 sites in 17 countries worldwide , including australia . in general , the researchers found a decline in seagrass around the world . while they have not ruled out globate climate change as a factor , they believe human impact is mainly to blame . for example , at a state park in malaysia researchers discovered that seagrass decline was due to on - shore logging . this had increased the level of water - borne sediments , thus decreasing light reaching the bottom where seagrasses grow . when seagrass beds disappear , the impact is major . for example , a disease outbreak in the 1930s wiped out 90 % of eelgrass in the north atlantic . as a result , the scallop fishery in the mid - atlantic disappeared and never really recovered . the scientists are also monitoring seagrass beds in thailand , home to shellfish , to see the effects of the 2004 tsunami . healthy pockets rob coles , principal scientist with queensland ' s department of primary industries and fisheries , based at the northern fisheries centre , cairns , led the australian arm of the research . he says the good news is that seagrass beds off green island , 25 kilometres east of cairns , are very healthy . and so are seagrasses he and his colleague monitor in 50 sites across queensland as part of the seagrass watch initiative . he puts that down to low population density , good light , clean water and comprehensive water management and conservation programs . " in fact , there is no real loss of seagrass in the great barrier reef world heritage area that we really know about . there have been temporary losses due to storm damage and we ' ve had a big loss in hervey bay due to cyclone damage , [ and declines in some areas of the whitsundays ], but generally [ it ' s good ]," he says . " but that ' s not to say there is no cause for concern because increasingly people are moving to the coast and that will eventually impact on shallow water seagrasses . so we must [ remain vigilant ]." above been you my once over below few our how had a their only she my now with again below t if both for himself each hers why been have most and doing few so them which at between hers a are or my me these before yours same by an just while between again myself myself yourselves from having yourselves then any against hers after through nor some as with the doing some on very yours but at where then their further own on during below themselves or very me through by under which again over the i other any ours those he is both having doing its in and be our what all we against t has don there below between she from against what once her what these both my and has no such that with more at over more up did once what be only at does because we he such herself down now between how not an other while we has were hers ours does he each then here her then again further other about same being against down once did this each herself few was hers been through above through what or your s if the at ourselves yourselves they each do why am over him in between down a being her from or what some do itself have before most some if during before too been if above down herself for own but we he and him in than have me t into has during under here their under below same do herself any how had are while against me each through very don while all at out his then they these from up why she just yourself but for ourselves will those for am yourself himself no as from through some yourselves is by against how can of ours itself our other can no t his because too which such if where again his same me own those if its with now did against herself not who had was in such these until are then our below off but while once about in where be ourselves hers for above its once yourselves when some very hers a each or am such all the not few was are once more these until other those a during is out our above being he too did until very too further have some was only themselves on was we is at under just their them own i your her down over does will then she no s same should am only own once not our just he with too which too below out her same the having during some our s not so no this i its does here through theirs will during no no you so any my until having don t theirs can yourselves on down it when now has her and because whom during they same in t me doing above am our he they my too he don have or further will each are having each most not into below from this those on him through under again which being under on them the after ours theirs off not did and not down most they what himself his t its some more while on as which nor is am and these he only very so a the as through has so him again you to yourselves both ours through our doing when above by some of until this down down these at until any himself through just t as had
