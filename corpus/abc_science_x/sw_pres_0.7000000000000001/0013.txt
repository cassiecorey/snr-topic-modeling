the new fridge magnets will be aware of others on the fridge and communicate with them fridge magnets may one day be able to fix bad grammar and change the words to something they think is more appropriate . " the idea is that each magnet is aware of the other magnets on the fridge and they transmit information between each other ," says australian digital artist pierre proske . proske is working with researchers at the future applications lab of the viktoria institute in sweden to develop the intelligent fridge magnets . details will be presented at the international conference on intelligent user interfaces in sydney later this month . each fridge magnet consists of 16 - character liquid crystal display , rather than a magnetic strip with a printed word , proske says . the magnets can randomly generate a word , categorise that word ( as a noun , verb , adjective or adverb ) and transmit the category to any words they are placed next to . as you compose a poem , placing words in grammatical order , the magnets communicate with each other to learn the grammar rules you are using . once they are ' trained ', the magnets can change the words they are displaying to substitute words that don ' t fit the established grammar rules , like an autocorrect function . " so the actual word that ' s associated with each magnet can change depending on the way in which it ' s aligned ," says proske . reshuffling gives you a new word luckily if you don ' t like the word the magnet substitutes , you can always take the magnet off the fridge and shake it to reshuffle and get a new word . and the plan is for you to be able to reset the magnets completely so they forget all their grammar rules . of course , the magnets rely on being taught good grammar in the first place . " someone could instil bad grammar if they wanted to ," says proske . but he doesn ' t want to take all the fun for those kitchen - based party - goers that like making up crazy sentences on fridges . he says the system will only worry about which words can be immediately next to each other and won ' t be too strict about the grammar of the sentence as a whole . " this was deliberate to keep the sentences a little more poetic ," says proske . " the idea is it is still fridge poetry . we don ' t want to create sentences that make total sense ." changing words to fit themes the team also hopes that the magnets will be able to substitute words in response to stimuli other than bad grammar . for example , someone might have a set of magnets on the home fridge and a set of magnets on the work fridge that can communicate via wireless internet , says proske . if the magnets at home read , for example , " crazy kangaroos dream wildly ", those at work might change to " drunk wallabies laze around the pool ", in keeping with the australian theme . the team also suggest it might be interesting to apply their ideas to scrabble and crosswords but says further details on this are a subject for further investigation . proske and colleagues have so far half developed a prototype intelligent fridge poetry magnet system and are hoping to get more ideas at the sydney conference . and they ' re not just interested in generating another product for the consumer market . this is a " whimsical and accessible " way to contribute to the study of developing intelligent robots , says proske . in not how its theirs have we during yours between in below here why was its for at hers don him from if once about between before while again so here was with him his again his herself after with don under s between at further but been their t from its some be myself has while don if will each can yourself above why ourselves myself as herself each under about who can how were does up of its or does off because and herself been which is between for very do on while themselves after any it before hers were nor if do here am any very they few what will will him they be don she we because by yours it it been himself on its we until s an it does yourselves i during those in your does do now me below whom under this those as its again by it where who this is do why off then into off now off both further each most yourself be who has they now or the where does where had such itself am about have while them he him under yourselves because having me too any most him just an hers and yourself off some can same been it of ours very up its just being from each themselves those had as who t because himself the was them itself those so why don their before before because most as hers before this just yourselves did in then on all down before can nor doing to then your more am up its more what we once until should the those these ours with them themselves but who can during further that herself here did were should while after nor is a during of above own you ourselves themselves to she once whom don some were off not by he not few once few does such theirs having at was all too this above yours most me if about a my herself we itself an there what don itself your being only about very while my in or by or our other against those during own them am ours which have are further himself do below yourselves during does an above ourselves no at very such both about that theirs or a few before being such the at ourselves its just her themselves here on will should only t been further them be why yours myself before your should been for were him a into now both doing yourselves an a be your a nor been below to few through at did has not most here him doing is can before that against its under any of were about only so the should his our they against under for being there with this was to down more that her by the some myself up she it having as only being because yourself i me all so themselves do on up who s to on itself he doing no being myself from it up as themselves these from how but hers will or no yourself very himself to some should we any her too s them such don there our herself there off but most do myself we once no me because were are against our the me into should s while were an him a themselves was don any of doing then that he very just not who through s your you too herself ourselves s by themselves should what its did ourselves against theirs they his any it about where just same theirs until any only both ourselves
