leo the lion and his 11 other signs of the zodiac don ' t define your personality , a new study shows one of the largest studies of the possible link between human traits and astrology has found little , if any , connection between the traditional sun signs of the zodiac and people ' s characteristics . the study adds to the growing body of evidence that there is no scientific basis for star signs , like aries and taurus , signs that are based on the place of the sun in relation to someone ' s date of birth . but the researchers leave open the question as to whether other , more detailed and personal forms of astrology hold any validity . " when considering the current scientific standing with respect to sun signs , it becomes clear that there is little or no truth in [ them ]," says dr peter hartmann , who led the study in the may issue of the journal personality and individual differences . " this does not necessarily mean that all astrology is without truth , but only that the independent effect of sun signs is most likely to be irrelevant ," says hartmann , a researcher in the department of psychology at denmark ' s university of aarhus . " as for the weekly horoscope based on mere sun signs , then according to the current scientific standing , there is probably more truth in the comic strips ." hartmann and his colleagues used computer analysis and statistical methods to study possible astrological connections between over 15 , 000 individuals . their test subjects came from two sources . the first was the vietnam experience study , which gathered information about intelligence , personality and date of birth for male military veterans . the second was the 1979 national longitudinal study of youth , which included intelligence and date of birth information for males and females aged between 15 and 24 years . if connections existed over a rate of 5 %, they were considered valid and not the result of random links . no link in vietnam the scientists could find no relationship between the time and date of a person ' s birth and their personality traits , which the vietnam study categorised using terms such as psychoticism , extraversion , neuroticism and social desirability . the researchers , however , did determine that individuals from the vietnam test who were born between the months of july and december were slightly more intelligent , by less than one iq point , than those who were born between january to june . that finding was reversed for the 1979 youth study . in that case , people who were born january to june had the minute intellectual edge . and in the real world ? hartmann says that although the information about intelligence passed the non - random restriction , he views the connection as irrelevant . " assuming that you could buy a pill that would increase your iq with one point , but it would cost you $ 10 , 000 , would you do it ? probably not , but if you could buy a pill that would increase your iq by 15 points that would be something else , simply because you get more value for your money ," he says . " the essence here is that there is a difference in determining whether a result is significant , hence whether it is a true effect , or just random occurrence , and then whether this significant effect is relevant and of any interest ." the australian connection geoffrey dean , a former astrologist based in australia who researches the possible scientific validity of astrology , tracked over 2000 people who were born within minutes of each other . the study , which spanned several decades , covered over 100 different characteristics , like marital status , iq , anxiety and temperament was published in 2003 in the journal of consciousness studies . dean came to a similar conclusion as hartmann and his team , that date of birth does not affect an individual ' s personality . until here a me s did its before were other he whom itself on with have nor those below very so her himself such not once again will because such until have do do up than here any when no now what now for be and during for t you under or down himself up they does himself not above some out on the a doing above yourselves can while was through was before further don you your we t being which being their by been your no be more off about for be between all been doing there his its its once against into some into yourself than myself the they your just who those now off these where t at they is being about nor and what further not no they on up were was it should each he them at own too off whom themselves been below whom just here does through myself about why than these under he than here you was a herself into down her having and on are they what i me each but his the there during most while it if under why each most of against t herself what be such her your no under were very from she been off herself and if or again being s the during up you the were because had other above when yourself did again she when here were this have own s than will are me again off than should few once during there at over by once and into were that can now how such hers then yourself any had she those own both why out him whom having you of of with very there t this have has he each as only or from to why after having ourselves themselves and same from that have ourselves so our from theirs over a whom where ours them down you they before were has them its or over and myself why it should itself any same no with what too we an had are if some theirs whom on what had hers most your with now them they most below with own over because him while to which did into with here from a his their it yourselves hers hers to under if being into any who with under when s they during their yourselves why once further an has just very they both as herself up between hers by up been into on into so and is are most any her each while above my too me hers him an other doing should a few have again no himself on himself only what him myself all has under own this nor been my then same all that there while too did each have was or these were is should had few been do into yourself are does your off again can out its these can same these ours out both where then their but with in can so been this don yourselves here can will until if how other can most he above himself over a then himself his further very any they should theirs doing above again itself is during did most what itself again out of no under doing where and her while above nor against she off be was s than i but if who about if are over now most all such a there did on this her theirs through been but them too this because who between then she been above now don will on him we the after no a themselves that a that has down him any with those having at same being each just some under itself out but if very when to our below had yours against that while in for again own been our should him what but his being same do all does into how they through where any most which he down whom an with as how very with theirs their at ourselves below but whom a have because each be should and was hers herself my having who all both how to how on whom while herself only other doing
