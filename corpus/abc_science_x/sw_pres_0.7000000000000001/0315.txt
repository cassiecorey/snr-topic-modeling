is technology a match for evolution ? and does this mean that modern humans are still evolving ? new evidence that the hobbit made the stone tools found alongside it might be evidence that humans are still evolving , says an australian researcher . the use of technology doesn ' t mean we have outwitted evolutionary selection pressures , says dr mark moore , an expert on ancient stone flaking technology at the university of new england . he made the comments in light of research published in today ' s issue of the journal nature on how early hominids used tools on the indonesian island of flores . some scientists have recently argued that the tools found alongside the hobbit at the liang bua cave are too complex to have been made by anyone but modern humans . but moore , along with australian and indonesian colleagues , think otherwise . the team analysed the techniques used to make over 500 tools found at mata menge , a site about 50 kilometres from where the hobbit was found . the researchers say although the tools would have been made 700 , 000 years before the hobbit was around , they seemed just as complex as the ones found alongside it . the researchers say the tools were probably made by ancestors of homo floresiensis , suggesting a long history of toolmaking on the island . this supports the idea that the hobbit , even with its small brain , was capable of making the tools found alongside it , says moore . he previously reported that such tools could be made without the degree of forethought usually associated with modern humans . " the techniques used to make [ the tools ] aren ' t quite as sophisticated as a lot of archaeologists would have you believe ," says moore . " they are certainly within the capabilities of a small - brained hominid ." implications for evolution those who discovered the hobbit believe it evolved from a larger bodied , larger brained ancestor that shrank over time as it was isolated on the island . the fact that the hominid could still make stone tools despite its shrinking brain suggests toolmaking was key to survival on the island . this supports the argument that technology helps humans survive changing environments . but moore thinks it also tells us that technology doesn ' t protect us from evolutionary selection pressures , like predators or other environmental factors that affect our survival . the environment is a bigger force than we give it credit for , he says . " there ' s an underlying assumption in the popular media , in particular , and amongst some scientists , that since we adapt to our environment through technology that somehow this is buffering us from the forces of natural selection ," says moore . but , he says , the use of technology by the hobbit ' s ancestors to adapt to their environment did not stop them from shrinking in response to selection pressures . " even thought they had a technological adaptation to the environment it didn ' t mean that they had stopped evolving ," says moore . " they clearly had continued evolving . technology was not able to stop that from happening ." he says this could be relevant to current debates over whether modern humans are evolving . " we are so surrounded by technology every day ," says moore . " but that doesn ' t necessarily mean that the environment isn ' t also having an effect ." from our above against can is does it as those he again what s once should into themselves off here under how am only did just all than through a before no few of he into yourself ours you himself how or doing under themselves then why do up all during very against through where hers an in themselves both during same be t yourselves again is nor our our about where they these so whom while yours a an does of which those most between you their a can if yours did herself where its a about had if you my so now theirs he to herself to but such don each now up only we other does i such than himself whom no each they further any few after or about or himself where on that which yourself all here himself before while again themselves than had herself my same your yours only herself same i himself why do those each no whom too further can a their that my did out their to these there up down as no can not now so we because his again t again so through about again being were themselves off so what should that once very this very because or does do be do during s do most it of how then only by few above only into i here into herself some myself after how as during is doing any or herself it once whom for theirs hers where is me and being in and before over an why will any all having no their some about your so a whom if for my against with no between into such an up when we itself during between s few do herself its or an was no these few having of only yours them an up them before each your had very where to them that the above ours into her up have and here while than did from during about whom by should hers your just before or we because no nor them too these under i and very up i whom each again of more these yourself after own who such am this himself his be that doing there these just own yourselves his as being from it now herself because own about nor because she their an into more should his is under what very i has them any but yourself from about ourselves to itself do an what where are down again because no that whom below than her against his own own and was who has them their this themselves not than on during this you i any hers can own doing not yours because as whom all for be she as but its itself i up other can through does i his off or own i before was herself of ourselves once against out too me yourself can who once whom those under just should whom but whom once is its while ours does down that has once down few your itself in very she where below yourself of yourselves through few will between own these because on don his about do at it has out no same their there no on into don hers should does to itself further should at had her which being its here that her his ours theirs should over under about me under in now no own same were other some only being theirs to on t then into are which ourselves until only under those don in him am against its as doing itself over be for below ourselves hers below they at while we itself him as off some herself too these yourselves been but under doing be did there each very s their me i will in has how each just any
