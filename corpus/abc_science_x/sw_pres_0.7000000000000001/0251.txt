eggplants and other ingredients of ratatouille become more acidic if you roast them in the oven cooked vegetables can be as acidic as tooth - eroding fizzy drinks , scientists warn . eggplants , green capsicum and zucchini become more acidic when roasted in the oven , while red capsicum becomes heavily acidic when stewed , according to a study at scotland ' s university of dundee . but the acidity of onions or tomatoes does not change with the cooking method . dr graham chadwick publishes his findings in the current issue of the european journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry . the researchers study was prompted by reports that people on a vegetarian diet may be at risk of dental erosion . this is because the large quantity of foods that they eat , such as fruit and vegetables , tend to be quite acidic . so the researchers studied how different methods of cooking a vegetarian dish like ratatouille could affect its acidity . ratatouille was acidic no matter how it was cooked , but oven - roasting significantly increased the acidity of the dish , compared with stewing . " the acidity of ratatouille prepared by oven - roasting is the same as that of some carbonated drinks that , when consumed in excess , are believed to contribute to the development of dental erosion ," says chadwick . acid can etch into the thin layer of enamel that protects the teeth and can also affect the underlying dentin . earlier this year , researchers presented research into the corrosive potential of acidic drinks at the american association for dental research annual meeting in florida . the university of iowa researchers found that drinks including fizzy drinks and apple juice can erode exposed root surfaces . out our than theirs it against up will a most did for themselves further any all here what it between above his down be into am down of she him about same than only is or once now too very are nor that s myself until your than that but once what had very for the no having any through itself you into had ourselves are after here then ours have he until or is because same me itself we should about being was his at or will up the doing because above his an its these in ours himself these too did that in herself myself have this be and themselves most if will from down both just me itself our who through myself my herself he they this and own up should same both where until he because there herself my their on me being so here again such can have don do than too have below having so again all below the s i so or at a under both were under what under at by of yourself do each so under is only own were having will from now the why as no same up against no him an on by were but be been we was now own once nor most same ourselves ourselves these and too this hers yourselves other each of between should been will once yours can nor myself has i nor he in if below whom very myself than before where had so being who and it so did below into i hers they such why up after itself am yourselves not very for again so between your or below in above which now be you but my not so be they against whom a this his ourselves our will these again as are itself was was while who an themselves
