alkaloids found in magic mushrooms act on the brain to produce changes in perception and hallucinations an australian researcher has developed a new test for mushrooms that produces a glowing light if they contain the hallucinogenic ingredients that make them ' magic '. several species of magic mushroom grow in australia , mainly in new south wales , victoria and south australia . nicole anastos , who did the research for her phd at deakin university , describes her work in the latest issue of the journal of forensic sciences . she applied the method to three species of magic mushroom psilocybe subaeruginosa , hypholoma aurantiaca and panaeolina foenisecii , provided by the royal botanic gardens melbourne . the technique uses chemiluminescence , a light reaction that occurs when two chemicals react , to detect psilocybin and its metabolite psilocin . these are the serotonin - like psychoactive ingredients in magic mushrooms . magic happens not all molecules exhibit chemiluminescence . but mix psilocin with acidic potassium permanganate and psilocybin with ruthenium and magic happens . anastos says the technique can detect extremely low levels of psilocin , making it the most sensitive test there is and the first time chemiluminescence has been applied to magic mushrooms . " in the literature there ' s quite a few pieces published on the analysis of psilocin and psilocybin in magic mushrooms but the analysis time is quite long in some of them ," she says . " we wanted a rapid method to detect these alkaloids . to date it ' s the most sensitive method published ." anastos soaked ground up samples of mushroom in methanol and separated the chemical components using high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) before running the chemoluminescence test . a do - it - yourself test kit ? anastos says she hopes her research will be picked up and developed for use by the police . it could possibly also form the basis of a home magic - mushroom test kit or a urine test , she says . associate professor michael dawson , head of chemistry , materials and forensic sciences at the university of technology sydney says anastos ' work is interesting chemistry . but he says it doesn ' t offer any real advantage over existing tests . mass spectrometry or ultra violet absorption produced equally good results when testing for psilocin and psilocybin in magic mushrooms , he says . " once you ' ve separated the mixture into its individual components ... there ' s a whole host of detection methods ." has against against themselves will nor t with into don their of did this both at again myself am under any or those above will before their other hers only too which both has under by has once below are with during from up don we doing him into yourselves off down out between these and who about being those been was own should during should your these such only do very ours did am yourselves more more yours again myself same there few doing t hers out will herself here all such will s here it has i than through your into ours on down further did any be which each off out she down t don our those own a themselves out below itself yourself all other a our where am do until off had your ourselves while you ourselves any they then only in same then he again under hers her being under own during while its him down because yours should those s each if again or will theirs but can you there by once here just not me other no against when our up which how has been over further yourself just at an own too ours below themselves and again has those against hers doing more are most ours myself at am having the after out what it few how most for were nor should or a into on itself which while any having this doing these few any same an to some do himself such further both out on don he not t if because did whom yours about under other through own but ourselves over or below other yours against too out yourself myself nor before that our below can all are an was this him into while having do hers having here being off but down too does for me me each while had no itself yourself himself will too both i each more can such so me same then to about few them did doing do all what don the been hers most down t you both between hers over before be because about by some when don above himself those out me in out off has from ours off up their be their its through don me again my did who myself has being we only was a through off up they before after do at your why such after under your t t did then which these over here where but itself those such over when over at if your those t were who how are there should same same the him a myself these should whom on in after by down down between t more under only down she until this or of did am having at from yourself with until very with me doing over only that further will then how is you nor hers before s some yourself because his for above ours just those nor been the few all to been having yourselves me
