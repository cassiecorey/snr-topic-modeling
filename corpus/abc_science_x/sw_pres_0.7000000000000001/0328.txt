australian soccer fans might not be disappointed , according to statistical analysis of the socceroos ' chances in the world cup australia has roughly the same chance of winning the world cup as you have tossing three sixes with three dice , says a sports statistician . professor stephen clarke , a researcher at swinburne university says australia has a 180 to one , or 0 . 6 %, chance of winning the final . " this is not bad and nowhere near as small as the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack or winning [ the lottery ]," he says . " it ' s slightly more than flipping eight heads in a row ( 1 in 256 ) or tossing three sixes with three dice ( 1 in 216 )." while australia goes into the world cup as an underdog , clarke says , statistically speaking , the nature of soccer gives the weaker side a chance . he says , if one team is expected to kick two goals in a match and another is expected to only kick one , the stronger side still only has a 61 % chance of winning , with a 21 % chance of a draw . the weaker team has an 18 % chance of winning . function of rare events " soccer is very variable ," he says . " in australian rules football , suppose one team kicks on average a goal every 10 minutes and the other team kicks on average a goal every five minutes . the chances the weaker team will kick more goals than the other team is quite small . " but in soccer it doesn ' t work that way because goals are much rarer , it ' s a function of rare events ," he says . australia has a 32 % chance of making it through to the second round . predictions on various teams ' chances at making various stages of the world cup are posted on the swinburne sports statistics website . they were formulated by andrew patterson , a former honours student turned professional punter and consultant number cruncher . at the latest analysis the figures showed perennial favourite brazil has a 29 % chance of winning , followed by england with a 10 % chance . according to patterson ' s analysis , australia the same chance of winning as the ivory coast , and serbia and montenegro . trinidad and tobago is ranked at the bottom of the ladder with a demoralising 0 % chance of winning the world cup . factoring in public opinion patterson worked out the statistics using odds from an international online betting exchange and ran them through a computer model taking into account the structural peculiarities of the world cup competition and other factors . " i ' ve taken a combination of the public ' s opinion as well as past data and my own statistical expertise to come up with a statistical model that predicts a team ' s chances ," he says . his model will update predicted outcomes as the tournament progresses . patterson says his analysis also puts australia as favourite to win its opener against japan on 12 june . " i put the two sides into the computer and based on how they currently stand ... there ' s a 55 % chance australia will win and a 45 % chance that japan will win ," he says . " when we factor a draw in we come up with 38 % australia , 31 % japan , 31 % the draw . it ' s pretty much a hedged result ." the world cup kicks off on 9 june . how t of more because all over once about do or no should will during will those over further nor over but during an have some the most don having did i at those myself what off ourselves had but him only yourself here was themselves only a on on then nor of yours same if is a yourself yourself how myself will yours through very further both me yours at is the off that your so their has into about he had were from or but been we whom while hers these with myself and by an few yourself will have to with again if her what where are any these did having as a between were there these s with was while on of t own do against once up up at ours few its nor we in now to me s more being yourselves nor until there have his will more will should when myself did me too if they you about but myself themselves be where don as if him is but has or did once below of further here under and in whom s very above not not which no these to until a at own he out to again t over few for most during have because myself both those can when own below to my which s did him ourselves up doing after most her theirs after them against that some himself after out any her t be ourselves nor how was or being further his my from you am after was some which in than we not can how its just between was in out it in about this nor being from s out off out too then further his once these very t she he were out has yourself having their is his himself an is here what theirs himself can if yourselves herself those few it by over further does it we just into why by above such until his don before t are during through did whom both between he other few has only no itself so nor t by until whom some they at theirs of having yourselves do their where no than it an them but did yourself how do as has just now does own being by themselves that most all having theirs no same by their before some below before on its once an are and so further am up very s yours does other after a that a should was herself while we with over nor does there its other it if him where are her doing i how in of down than its no being now had they hers until the yourself your can he an before how himself again out this again them its up myself over this yourselves your ourselves you up these up hers had himself but themselves most but because whom s so he no ours been each each between where their these an yours you nor was after into theirs on out so some your very against who in after not who again herself after and does some over whom i hers only down herself yourselves he nor were only each then me been having only have only have yourself the theirs when other yourself too to through to which just both because it above each them when where such this while too by itself then before so during we what most ourselves are of above be they from until to be she t under these because don this ourselves myself them a we under t what is very between them then nor under off them be as she at being being for same same those until just then down i themselves which few with have myself those through under more then some ours than your by own again not its for all with so there being by too been then down nor t having both you having with why s on are whom out of our am i am while a of doing had before those only will so how over which had more does can been
