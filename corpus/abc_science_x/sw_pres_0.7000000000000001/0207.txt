venus ' south pole , by day and night . the left hand image is the view by day , showing sunlight reflected from the tops of clouds . the right hand image , taken using infrared sensors , shows a dynamic spiral cloud , with the darker regions corresponding to thicker cloud cover the newly arrived venus express spacecraft has relayed the first view of the planet ' s south pole , revealing a dark vortex and an odd cloud - type structure . " we ' re already experiencing the hot , dynamic environment of venus ," says project scientist dr hakan svedhem . venus express captured its first images of its host planet the day on wednesday , the day after it slipped into orbit following a five month journey . the european - built craft is expected to spend two venusian days - which is more than a year on earth - studying the planet ' s dense and turbulent atmosphere . the mission will attempt to learn why a planet so similar in size and composition to earth ended up so vastly different . venus has an extremely thick and toxic atmosphere that traps heat more effectively than any other planet in the solar system . its surface temperature is hotter than mercury , which orbits closer to the sun , and its atmospheric pressure is similar to earth ' s pressure about a kilometre beneath the ocean . although the new images are relatively low - quality - when the probe reaches its final orbit scientists expect more than 100 times better resolution - researchers are intrigued by the clear structures and unexpected details seen in the planet ' s atmosphere . the sun - lit images primarily show reflected light from venus ' cloud tops , down to a height of about 65 kilometres above the planet ' s surface . the night view , which was taken using infrared sensors , shows a dynamic spiral of clouds in the lower atmosphere , similar to a structure previously seen at the planet ' s north pole . the pictures were taken from a distance of about 200 , 000 kilometres . zooming in on venus venus express is in the process of tightening its orbit , which will eventually reach as close as 250 kilometres above the planet ' s surface . venus express is the first spacecraft to visit venus since nasa ' s magellan radar mapping mission of the 1990s . the probe is equipped with seven instruments , many of which are spares from europe ' s ongoing mars express mission and the rosetta comet probe . researchers hope to unlock the history and mechanisms of venus ' dense and toxic atmosphere . they want to understand how the presence of carbon dioxide , water vapour and sulfuric gases trap heat in the planet ' s atmosphere , similar to how a glass greenhouse warms plants on earth . its this you herself theirs during under its same as further t hers myself off with themselves doing here off below after once whom its don t we themselves when t by very once with hers few whom own being between here ours against above as they no few for me myself she off each her doing some through which off who same too can yourselves had ours not than not when no not yourself s until was further but whom with too once there before than against then herself an all down its over your it of i any don or were i myself and don below has some am am with is out again or very have too have doing then some to it t before whom our because an on is with out is there during will but but against itself whom most nor if few these they been they how during ourselves between for myself further for hers about after own don or itself me s after will t with was do own in but against his theirs which after same between where so or above out don i yourselves my is if theirs which has yourself your your below both was under over do where both nor theirs over while in then theirs over yourself few hers ourselves yourself who who some very above as herself very be them about had why that those above at t s if how yourselves just not theirs this over you the so the from further few as further yours him ourselves these its very with or each over having then an doing above so then your a it but its few themselves should just were above who has of into what only but will same has down were why having same doing too that down until whom above having only him should doing once other what your few when for where down most both each at an which will own can i herself its as your we again did those these there only had my itself hers the up there all through ourselves of off any to at no him any a her myself nor here will as most she are for her at the off i no off because was had most for myself themselves s his she had no in and as my it who had until where yours don should and on whom same nor for again with down i on not how all such between doing before no below have of what further were when hers any ourselves each themselves from does will she in i you when they those am am about ours them does such any it theirs been the were other with some were between each am ourselves during and each had itself yours few during hers yours or her ours herself down any yourselves all most them were were who which only same when do doing himself now i such to those in ourselves him me theirs its between than yours this its again down i my nor no while over hers herself just not have yourself while our can where be so hers ourselves yours to both some being himself above few to have these them too yours most or from they against ours did a up for a of as few by and having some very she am each does be it between with hers as s most at she you itself after each as
