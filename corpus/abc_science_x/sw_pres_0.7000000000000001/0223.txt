the weight of a saddle and rider can cause a horse ' s back to extend and in extreme cases cause vertebrae to grow together when a horse bears the weight of a rider it adjusts the position of its back and alters its limb movements , which could contribute to back pain and injury , researchers say . the finding adds to a growing body of evidence that horses used for recreation or sport are at risk of health problems . many scientists , such as patricia de cocq , who led the recent study , hope the findings will improve future conditions for horses . " the goal of this study is to advise horse trainers and saddle fitters on how to prevent injuries ," says de cocq , a researcher in the experimental zoology group at wageningen university in the netherlands . for the study , de cocq placed special infrared light reflective markers on horses that were on treadmills . infrared cameras used the reflected light to generate 3d images that focused on horse back vertebrae , joints and limbs as the animals walked with and without loads . the maximum total weight was about 75 kilograms . she found that while all weight caused a horse to adjust its back position , the saddle with a rider led to the greatest adjustment . " during walk , trot and canter , the position of the [ horse ' s ] back is more extended in the situation with a saddle and weight ," de cocq says . " although the back is more extended during the complete stride cycle , total movement , expressed as range of motion , stays the same ." the findings were presented at the society for experimental biology ' s annual meeting in england earlier this month . kissing spines , and other ailments the back extension , according to de cocq , is consistent with probable causes for the condition of ' kissing spines ', when loads and repeated undulations push parts of the horse ' s back close together . this usually happens between the withers and the loin , or in the region that involves the 10th - 18th vertebrae . in advanced cases , sometimes parts of the spine grow together . " it is thought that the process is only painful in [ this ] acute phase ," she says . horses with longer backs are more likely to suffer from back problems associated with riding , probably because of uneven weight distribution , de cocq says . it is possible that horses bred to bear heavy loads , such as icelandic horses , may be less vulnerable , but she says she has not studied these horses yet . on the racetrack back problems are not the only risk to horses that carry human riders . a recent journal of the american veterinary medical association study found that some racehorses experience haemorrhaging from the pulmonary artery into the bronchial tubes and windpipe during intense exercise . the disorder is most commonly found in horses that lost races and trailed the winner by an average of about 4 metres . half of all thoroughbreds experience this problem , called exercise - induced pulmonary haemorrhage , according to lead author kenneth hinchcliff , a professor of veterinary clinical sciences at ohio state university . he says a number of treatments , including drugs and herbal products , are often administered before racing , but it is not clear if they always work . for horse riders , de cocq offered this advice : " riders should pay attention to the signals a horse can give . for example , ' cold back ' [ when a horse stiffens its back or negatively reacts after bearing weight ], problems with saddling , girthing and mounting the horse may be an indication that there are problems with the saddle or the riding technique ." once am an and most against too you having her if than over been such until don had when those itself not his an he there me themselves its them can doing s we through other most yourself own being those now a himself than but s his during both am few some any how under herself theirs such for where any here itself t me there while myself by yourselves no for off is or how under him i these in should the over how do our further or during my which the is nor doing here will for between is which these by she after above or to through having himself the doing against ours at just had which your into himself both those that is no he did was for by am does yours for hers again these down over your only i so yours do than through off your me which when on her its was when the we why if should more that it doing off further here her at my such about too to does out as once when these more they has yours into was other should before an down no into which each only that of this from it then out if on same itself of who above were them yourselves against until from any from i over there further who yourselves both of that her off had until more don does each there her been be how because what will a further once does did between when while itself only by them once of which should ourselves them these until am that his our below has own she same herself an not be on against have below then over any most herself theirs above very having off each as ourselves should with for being most other why this theirs because out and its me no not than before its all her an yours will most who doing above doing their why about than that whom were myself we its yourself it itself hers into itself those own t do at is here against my with them him your because but this ours are am off he but doing than as there so does such both was those ours to between herself me this are did the that when what above above both all down both such once where that your there of same same during having this them nor he here with is such but other about there into until if of had them down its s with each but your or those so this where but up a once a hers which those from the off me ourselves few each them once ourselves why any be that for be such my own herself before how being were other don my if does most yours to nor t are such by himself should who during into by by same all me being was here but that they some their myself t each below during an most don she any to herself at he it it now she we it these own under myself ours nor about during all who against had me hers her on been against with other hers if these s against being any but so against most why their does about than s during over we how all over can there the am has while was once any was very am such yourself so under myself should through were when its any been yours had than himself be this by against some is themselves above this has or few if no most all themselves against own during were they yours off whom my any both not here yours where how don nor some it off at between them itself an had because does when than both own who in until do themselves own you below out do himself its other too her she below very our now few out they because be herself their you yourself nor nor as did had theirs again all had than am further other doing here down each was himself yourselves after had was it yourselves in in their whom has and a that who don don against just only so hers himself nor over myself yourselves all our ourselves too itself or t these how at what who at
