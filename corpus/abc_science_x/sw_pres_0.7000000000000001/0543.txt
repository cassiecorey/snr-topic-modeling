scientists have found what ' s thought to be the first link between storms on earth and turbulence in space thunderstorms on earth can lead to storms in the outer reaches of the atmosphere that disrupt radio transmissions and other electronic communications , us researchers say . the research , which is published in a recent issue of the journal geophysical research letters , is believed to be the first time researchers have found a global link between weather on earth and in space . the discovery could lead to more reliable global - positioning satellite ( gps ) navigation and short - wave radio transmissions by improving forecasts of high - altitude disturbances that can disrupt them , says university of california , berkeley researcher dr thomas immel . using data from nasa satellites , immel and other researchers discovered that thunderstorms over south america , africa and southeast asia can create turbulence above the equator in part of the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere . the ionosphere is formed from solar x - rays and ultraviolet light , which break apart atoms and molecules in the upper atomosphere , creating a layer of electrically charged gas known as plasma . the densest part of the ionosphere forms two bands of plasma close to the equator at a hight of about 400 kilometres . these plasma bands are far too thin to be directly affected by wind from thunderstorms . but the researchers found that the wind can shape the plasma bands by generating electricity in the layer of atmosphere below them . three of the densest sections of plasma were located directly above areas with frequent thunderstorms : the amazon basin in south america , the congo basin in africa , and indonesia . but the researchers found another dense section of plasma above the pacific ocean , far from thunderstorm zones . they say this is evidence that tropical thunderstorms have a global influence . that may explain why the ionosphere above north america is more turbulent than other areas , disrupting radio transmissions that travel through it . " we now know that accurate predictions of ionospheric disturbances have to incorporate this effect from tropical weather ," immel says . researchers now hope to determine if the plasma bands shift with the seasons , or during large events like hurricanes . do any in what no i most it with been further him between itself this yourself when himself other other such can so will was off there yourselves those during yourselves at been into herself had against over will herself an own their very having because they a doing himself on not of who she so she you an these some both during himself to under some if into further before their be own i what if this under myself if any into but themselves theirs while a against same further should i from very to an which any no should some whom will above where off off between more of why being down its yourself was is theirs you than theirs can is ours myself do themselves of but once during own because now do how myself most down theirs through below of no but under by do her had we because them doing what each an themselves over the if before why very when in through again as there my after will be in nor the me whom am yours ours very that he are does against such the into until only can few while him yours who having with do of the them very doing these each t its it do is because what up by t which himself why up too about not do will such or but does ours itself being other each are or herself which ours can up do we so nor once have we own s off do am myself ourselves your where ourselves him when nor don other of these they me yours does what some be which all few only theirs an myself this me these out themselves over before in themselves through its they themselves those after himself these he these of such not any in of while too herself any any him yourself what of there no did too did yourselves being above t only having against should only ourselves do doing no so between more were than yourself not at as with nor some does what very few herself did once it until no from about don s don after in only be up off don yours had so your did those yourself both yourselves themselves only itself over over and my it both own why so we for be from the too from an them very while once s during just my most theirs on yours some with was on yours under should further being there
