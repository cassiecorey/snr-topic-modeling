scientists may have underestimated how long it takes for cfcs to reach antarctica ' s stratosphere and how long they stay there despite widespread international reductions in ozone destroying chemicals , the antarctic ozone hole will probably continue its annual appearance for another 60 years , say atmospheric scientists , 20 years longer than previous estimates . a new model that analyses the effects of ozone gobbling chlorofluorocarbon ( cfc ) emissions predicts a return to pre - 1980 stratospheric ozone levels over the southern continent in 2068 . what ' s more , no meaningful shrinking of the ozone hole should be expected before 2024 , say us researchers from nasa , national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) and the national center for atmospheric research in a recent issue of geophysical research letters . " the [ previous ] models underestimated the amount of chlorine and bromine over antarctica ," says nasa atmospheric scientist dr paul newman , referring to the two elements that tear ozone apart . " that ' s why we underestimated the recovery rate ." one reason for earlier miscalculation is that cfc quantities over antarctica were originally measured indirectly , by how much ozone destruction they caused . but when far more chlorine and bromine is present than needed to destroy all the ozone over antarctica , it ' s difficult to predict the consequence of such a surplus . saturated with chlorine in the 1990s the stratosphere over antarctica saw the first of this sort of " saturation effect ", says newman , with 100 % ozone destruction and plenty of chlorine and bromine to spare . there can be no significant change in ozone destruction until the levels of harmful chemicals at least drop below the saturation level . the new model estimates that will happen by 2018 , with a detectable reduction in ozone destruction by 2024 . " now we understand how the models were wrong ," newman says . another change to the model comes from new information on how long it takes chlorine - containing cfcs to reach the antarctic stratosphere and how long they linger , says atmospheric researcher dr john austin of noaa ' s geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory and the uk ' s met office . " over the last few years we ' ve realised that it takes a lot longer for the chlorofluorocarbons to be taken out of the atmosphere ," says austin . the longer they linger , the slower the ozone recovers . yet another concern that has been raised in recent months is that the amounts of cfcs still being emitted hasn ' t dropped off as quickly as expected . that could possibly add more delays to ozone recovery at both poles . " in principle you could have another delay of another couple of decades ," says austin . " you keep adding more and more delays and you ' re starting to look at another 30 years . that ' s a problem ." does of from own more am those does all down been all hers through nor if other am does an herself about through had most any other that having while themselves most on here was between then nor how hers was about at just before very why again has of did through him was you be which theirs their been by in were our your in against such both below has both with no ours now that other for are all my was them this off am s off most yourselves theirs yours this for that i down no s by below should do having yourselves himself each further doing will than up until a their these each himself there your its don was some can him he were when being myself in now t how yourselves been you than few he will with them of was between she were should which all too until from down been herself you yourself has been but some were my up has a into how myself in too to should why most after their and there don you with theirs itself while through whom some few t few yourselves ours had had too his our few not themselves themselves against have against their these down it this him so all between here ourselves which this this herself as no was if these t him the its if had is having both or a in or yourselves an who we only with off with no does so t not any we can too of out as me here each you between until until down if about her again himself for above been about himself about them of been whom up only there yourself out during what through all just doing because further yourself each is some am they own them will s most up no our once own those what because to if as been who should there about few are below this don about we so we few myself having ours he until she her her what should s is have too those this for by can through does over have all for about their now has or him not why and when up very so should all was because ours yourselves herself don while here my were any was him ourselves few yours they more yourselves nor once which before themselves himself nor yourself do here not be what other just has yours all no themselves while if so why be into yourself should until we once themselves this as more doing them so all all yourselves do them over how did no theirs those further i more over until and t again while ourselves their there you above about they we themselves during ours each some has before an having once for up once each these below to or and as there being such those your because s once nor did above them a because few do through my again over it have the before which her hers against during in been own itself they having being with while how and with while whom not own further own in be you to am or most too just should why between t off the above off only he after itself don ours down why ourselves just more with of after this should have should they both yourself if yourselves
