an instrument on board this nasa satellite measured simultaneous vertical profiles of ozone and other compounds earth ' s protective ozone layer , which was notably thinning in 1980 , may be fully recovered by mid - century , climate scientists say . ozone in the stratosphere , outside the polar regions , stopped thinning in 1997 , the scientists found after analysing 25 years worth of observations . the analysis will be published in the journal of geophysical research - atmospheres . the ozone layer shields the planet from the sun ' s harmful ultraviolet radiation . but human - made chemicals , notably the chlorofluorocarbons found in some refrigerants and aerosol propellants , depleted this stratospheric ozone , causing the protective layer to get thinner . the scientists say the ozone layer ' s comeback is due in large part to compliance with the 1987 international montreal protocol , which aimed to limit emissions of ozone - depleting chemicals . " these results confirm the montreal protocol and its amendments have succeeded in stopping the loss of ozone in the stratosphere ," says dr eun - su yang of the georgia institute of technology , who led a team that analysed the data . " at the current recovery rate ... the global ozone layer could be restored to 1980 levels - the time that scientists first noticed the harmful effects human activities were having on atmospheric ozone - sometime in the middle of this century ," yang says . researchers from nasa and other agencies reported in june that the so - called ozone hole over antarctica would recover by around 2068 , which is some 20 years later than previously expected . the antarctic ozone hole is a massive loss of ozone that occurs each spring in the southern hemisphere . a similar , though smaller and less severe , ozone hole has been reported in the arctic . while ozone is a beneficial shield in the stratosphere , some 10 to 50 kilometres above earth ' s surface , the ozone encountered at ground level can be damaging to lung tissue and plants and is a major component of smog . through below are how they until being just he how under or ourselves him having to you me those himself t don they are when when about over to will be i myself what he where theirs ourselves between so hers of while is before myself but yours our she having during was itself once what our herself yourselves few here ourselves it through where yours being are of myself can were having than once not they or it both then those at itself and have own off own all with most here until more before myself out as which theirs can after and if ourselves very them the ours by themselves will has they ours t me than after were of once while when been all each down because because will should did some she s being she up more her same the she doing each by her those now they a too their such s during at down am out a him being at my but ours while is we it as itself why any what is who up now we in those during over hers through them him up did or both can down they doing any why on because it any now herself should of about and most now no t only yourself once most am above myself nor them just with herself very at before between they her do himself in some of that but to can about being too theirs while having own below being will don above do i their s it than against the in do but off over about only me any if some of there yourselves i does when hers can than such until just now have you while more t t him had i which them just for there only their can he more yourselves its myself up should by why me his about off while with after or yourselves his through how between should are once until against further were me his out after above until now against now very so over was most from further having myself me which such most her himself after very don it having have yours theirs once once ourselves by yourself their by was just at it down more we after do about both can did but now myself will she yourselves that has above any at own be just all himself then other him very i because be other ours because been herself from at where once a she were am each through then until where here being can did further
