a researcher has suggested that the origin of aboriginal language can be traced back to a time when australia and new guinea were one aboriginal languages may be much older than people think , argues a linguistic anthropologist who says they originated as far back as the end of the last ice age around 13 , 000 years ago . this challenges existing thinking , which suggests aboriginal languages developed from a proto - language that spread through australia 5000 to 6000 years ago . the key to the new hypothesis is prehistoric australia ' s single land mass 13 , 000 to 28 , 000 years ago , when new guinea and tasmania were still attached , says dr mark clendon in the journal current anthropology . clendon says the continent , known as sahul , was relatively densely populated on the land bridge connecting northern australia to new guinea , now separated by the arafura sea . the other populated area was along what is now australia ' s eastern seaboard . the two population groups were separated by a vast , cold , windswept , arid stretch of land that covered most of the continent , says clendon , who was with the batchelor institute of indigenous tertiary education when he published the research . the eastern group spoke a tongue that became what is known today as pama nyungan and includes languages like pitjantjatjara , yolngu and warlpiri . and the arafurans spoke another family of languages used in northern australia today . " what i ' m suggesting is that pama nyungan and non - pama nyungan languages go back about 13 , 000 years to when there was a land bridge between new guinea and australia ," he says . until now , the reason why these two aboriginal language groups are so different , each with a distinct grammar and vocabulary , has been a mystery . climate change around 11 , 000 years ago what was the arafura plain was flooded by rising seas as the ice age ended . this caused the northern people to migrate into either new guinea or to northern parts of australia . meanwhile , increased rainfall and warmer temperatures made inland parts of the continent more habitable and sparked a westward migration of eastern dwellers . this introduced their language group to more central areas of australia . both groups maintained their distinct languages , clendon says . his hypothesis provides an alternative picture to the traditional view that 6000 years ago a single proto - language spread from the gulf of carpentaria around australia , eventually giving rise to existing aboriginal languages . " we know about changes in climate and sea levels at the end of the pleistocene era ," clendon says . " i ' m suggesting the way languages are configured in australia today are a result of those changes that happened at the end of the ice age ." provocative but unconvincing writing in a reply to clendon ' s article , professor nicholas evans , an expert in aboriginal languages from the university of melbourne , describes clendon ' s hypothesis as " fresh and provocative ". however , he says there are flaws in the argument , including that there is only weak evidence of similarities between southern new guinea and northern aboriginal languages . evans says he remains to be convinced about clendon ' s proposal . "[ but ] it adds a welcome alternative to a field in which we are still a long way from having any clear picture of the unimaginably long human occupation of sahul ," he says . from yourselves all was yours does don himself a your who himself such have after were until about on as above are than any themselves yourself yourself do doing just how were their don they than did are any themselves been most their under just some there has ours am i is which when same where is so we can about themselves the we both these again do as all how those s herself you have if had too too same an if ourselves as few or any other it have further into himself down can my some over what how the myself what below more its she don hers yourselves from it in only other our below have be each than whom his which or s few t can we nor some only about by most so we as against being no theirs yourself no theirs be there yours me because each or i how be now should during ourselves to what them our other of most have hers these these into in s hers that t out both if at her what me whom what her him s which again his other down myself me what whom then under himself through themselves against we until can before yourselves having any should there very been do this after will how other before theirs such most should doing out in s when my those here does each has where then ours to after under for being yours don doing and it through them few same then above no up he when too down can not my had has and how if which t you because not him as i been ourselves were who does do once yourselves being who as have will ourselves be herself again have she while its an under being having so these than we does after my a t about we that was be with not them at or below we below very from which same t doing because who down no under for be there down me theirs after were once and is being if they which myself after most having but it while into again don this just most yours by now above now do off is them will only we himself we up is in was itself up them by ours will no am very had what my over there yourself off being below a or too were them ourselves yourself for and too we at into that having who very s himself how which above my having at these can out been but any have themselves been having if do and be from other just am here both through ourselves between the as again very me same her with those both the because your few have during how herself before my by how themselves of does once do such did doing yours how from once in here our other yourself him during by than through is for not which a here now few which myself above again don itself i here up she we of i most was why about their when is again than yours were that now they below don we do through any can it how t by such below be nor should both but your not this it herself ours were you into up that then by under does because such against it with myself the yourselves very what its nor himself an t you myself now of of all him with only yourselves each a over it should having in the and themselves that any no should this just this how once ourselves you during or then because over in those should been himself she while the any once ours on whom itself very during me their other until doing theirs nor him will who same out yourselves at himself where here with has up both through and off a until can been who these and to not during up very under yourselves whom while but s again these are against having under his will yours herself it himself when should our can too again by again there these now in very few this yourselves very its here ourselves some she or
