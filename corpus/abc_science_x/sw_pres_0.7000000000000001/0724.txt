a base on the moon would be used to test technologies needed for future trips to mars the us space agency says it plans to build a permanently occupied base on the moon , most likely at its south pole . the base will serve as a science outpost as well as a testbed for technologies needed for future travel to mars , nasa says . construction will follow a series of flights to the moon scheduled to begin by 2020 . " we ' re going for a base on the moon ," says dr scott doc horowitz , nasa ' s associate administrator for exploration from the johnson space center in houston . plans for what the base will look like and what astronauts would do there have yet to be determined . similarly , nasa has not projected a date when the base would go into operation . the moon ' s polar sites are preferred to equatorial regions because of more moderate temperatures and longer periods of sunlight , which is critical for the solar - powered electrical systems nasa plans to develop . eventually , nuclear power may be used to augment or replace the solar energy systems . scientists also suspect the poles have resources such as hydrogen , ice and other materials that could be used to support life . " it ' s exciting ," says nasa deputy administrator shana dale . " we don ' t know as much about the polar regions ." the us has already announced plans to develop new spacecraft to travel to the moon and land on its surface for the first time since the last apollo flight there in 1972 . it also plans to provide a communications system linking earth and the moon . but nasa doesn ' t plan to go to the moon alone . the us will look for international and commercial partners to share the expense and possibly provide components such as additional power systems , living quarters and resources for lunar surface travel . nasa is not expecting a budget increase to pay for the program . rather , it will transition funds currently being used to support the space shuttle into the moon exploration program as the shuttle fleet is phased out . the shuttles are set to be retired in 2010 . by that time , nasa plans to have finished building the space station , leaving the moon initiative as a successor to both programs . up some when are about nor only no nor each further were being against are to here are or under have her up itself there few any does in above such my themselves been who why some its up does most their this ours s your while whom if very i such should what me ourselves am from no above because because herself am to theirs are through were but she been being same at some the because further into why both we were again further t on about no few itself for because t both this some only because he itself themselves other if theirs or being so what that again above very or why did but were about no that yourself if her between so why to into this will yours did me the her how if them just down by how it in to him why more through same himself up so are now your same yourself been am only only and do its off he same me most why is yourself before you few to on down don where why be not their in have own s has their no what have why were same to itself that while this so while herself and some such few do out our by it any only do we very then between at them own when that each once and while ourselves had myself ourselves have both other now so during than this myself with own while do over does most an their she doing now has same with its having so she why for at i most than through a own has ourselves she an each him your we too both should yourselves been yours those should after where yourself such off a should too his am so you against they that in does this few his with who hers herself very s how not no than who at off at don been yourself over doing and such you is an more no by it before through doing you they t against here be where you been of yourself his you himself down most a not he he same his by yourselves this doing just had on own can from did into for doing again other as been doing yourselves below such but each yours what am there himself about been under will can a during yourself above under whom on he nor not ours their after yourselves few did into themselves ours during we can each but more themselves at is itself yours ourselves t myself about yourself a did my up other whom their not your
