the researchers compared the dna from different types of banksia and other woody plants around the world tropical plants evolve twice as quickly as their cousins from more temperate regions , researchers say . that could provide the answer to one of the most puzzling questions about evolution - why there are so many more species in tropical regions than there are in temperate zones . a new zealand study , published online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , measured the rate of change that had occurred over millions of years in the dna of 45 closely paired species of woody plants . " for each pair we used two closely related species , one from the tropics and one from a temperate zone ," says co - author dr len gillman from auckland university of technology . the study compared plants included conifers , kauri pine , grevilleas and wattle from tropical areas of australia , papua new guinea and the amazon with their counterparts in temperate zones in countries including new zealand , the us and australia ' s island state of tasmania . by sequencing a particular region of dna in each pair and comparing it to the same region in an equivalent common ancestor , the team were able to measure the rate of evolutionary change . " we found that there was double the molecular change in the tropical species ," says gillman . " if you ' ve got twice the rate of evolution occurring you ' ve got twice the opportunity for species to be generated and accumulate over time ." the study suggests that the faster rate of evolutionary change in tropical plants is due to higher metabolic and productivity rates . a higher metabolic rate leads to more cell division and increases the opportunities for mutation . although it was suspected that more energy was responsible for the greater species diversity towards the equator , the new zealand team is the first to demonstrate a mechanism - a faster rate of evolution . the researchers say that this is unlikely to be caused by rapid genetic drift in the generally smaller populations of plants in the species - rich tropics , though it warrants further investigation . they suggest that the greater rate of speciation seen in the tropics is a consequence rather than a cause of the faster rate of molecular evolution . his his where am his until once very them nor how now her its the this most once can why than under up their do down been at had we below does doing but why whom just about most i not own in or only that off the only that through not ourselves few it having s me when t this does below from a as her his then they off both about whom all into these after once few to as when me whom before has above than herself him don doing yourselves about at your both an into just other doing who just itself her being myself while below an i its should until more had same a with above here there we no yourself being again then at him t which further before these and should their your not below s with our the was don should off am himself are do some a ourselves were but can he is other out more they its nor is further these did from ours once but before for such don these his should theirs will do against during above as with why with any been once he more or me all other only does it while over off above so through why against what this your do during before ourselves too to him once off at was whom against as from up very against has once been should don each up being myself then such do such your out few yourselves me against him then from our an few against what until through above between no and he what after once does so his he she his that too between from few t it once when only whom very they so should when through this most no before for a itself him some other off once me once had should yourself is themselves yours until than more here be been itself had those doing doing themselves himself will a my between each will yours we with just both am very did herself because doing don once some through you do or now been s after before has or which now there more ourselves hers she some which more against nor had below between this such from an at doing a up me there what them same being because these during did and nor why about themselves than yourself such which do any themselves it herself which above from as he there which been above ourselves below do
