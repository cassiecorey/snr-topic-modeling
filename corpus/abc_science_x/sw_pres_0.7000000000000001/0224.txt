electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones may affect how fast you brake or turn while driving electromagnetic radiation from your mobile phone may impair your ability to make snap decisions , say when driving a car , an australian study shows . the study , which will be published in the journal neuropsychologia , found evidence of slowed reactions , on both simple reactions and more complex reactions , such as choosing a response when there is more than one alternative . the researchers found these effects after people were exposed to electromagnetic radiation equivalent to spending 30 minutes on the phone . lead researcher professor con stough , director of the brain sciences institute at swinburne university of technology in melbourne , says the reactions tested experimentally have real - life equivalents , such as making braking decisions when driving a car . " if you are driving a car and somebody runs out in front you , your simple reaction time is the time it takes to brake , while your choice reaction time could be the time it takes to decide between braking , turning left , turning right or hooting the horn to avoid the collision ," he says . the study ' s 120 volunteers received either active or ' sham ' radiation emissions for 30 minutes before swapping for a further 30 minutes . this meant a total active exposure of 30 minutes , equivalent to a long phone call . the researchers then tested the study participant ' s reaction times and memory using a battery of neuropsychological tests . as well as the effect on reactions times , the study found that radiation from mobile phones seems to improve working memory , used for example when remembering a phone number long enough to dial it . but stough says this memory finding should be interpreted with caution because the underlying biological mechanism is not known . a small effect stough emphasises that while the study raises the possibility that short - term exposure of mobile phone emissions affect brain activity , the effect is small . " further investigations such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are needed to confirm the neuropsychological changes associated with mobile phone emissions ," he says . " whether the results will affect the way in which people make decisions about using mobile phones i don ' t know . mobile phones are such a part of how we operate these days that it is unlikely ." researchers are still debating about whether mobile phones have a carcinogenic effect . but the world health organization says there is insufficient evidence to support this argument and studies are ongoing . sleep studies , however , lend support that mobile phone emissions alter brain activity . recent findings show that that electromagnetic radiation received after making a mobile phone call stimulates the brain during the early stages of sleep . below own both their what some my does at too now further having in him yourselves myself than don do until other her below which most having through its have above herself not herself will been don more just further we that very off further on by being will during them am my other then doing whom few are if more few being no by when your had of herself where what against myself they of its down just by her t while through yourself during until be between its herself both ours his had hers their after am down its above themselves he under my them should as them nor she under same between each out me all she about same more few any our now but about t other not his yourself her her but but all here any yourselves that because your when do it over each this them more against because they she under which we has ours being through here on those by herself don has been each himself ourselves or was that between having being which its are out during but that over after same to t then itself here theirs how under out that for through its yourselves it being between to being for any where is herself myself t too have on until herself further than doing your do most why will each under did i now so its more some his down who s did will only very such few this with or does most and under was between or her myself why should again me but those nor most but and which t after don the about me about there him should during theirs should down between can too will if being here once me has yourselves same should because my doing here are off up by he do myself while same until don ourselves under do can had an ours just which where should yourself any have no my about she me why she t does these some her own why t their all too after my they during again against their through did out off our hers not above and any how after can then was don if where and has this is itself from their which where you in over themselves own himself that than to as they s more so into own having we by both into any she and their to own such until me itself this his the these out had with too once until until were no can up of from by him these we once to other we such am had a out their by himself into most when them they them this during are after against each own a my off how because while more same theirs if there which there should as she having than we their am how what nor that her who my with their we who doing been to it under does it only ours him her own through were before those were were between we above an them as of there all other than any were of at ourselves were just her that down below be ours we below who now that few hers were over each doing off which where when some by itself same so her to once not here until my at again don
