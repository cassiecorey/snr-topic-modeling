while the rodent study appears to be successful , many safety tests would be needed before the liquid is used on humans having surgery biodegradable liquids that control bleeding during surgery could dramatically reduce time in the operating theatre , a study says . researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) and the university of hong kong have developed a liquid composed of small protein fragments that can stop bleeding in wounded rodents within seconds . the researchers say this is the first time that nanotechnology , technology at the atomic or molecular scale , has been used to achieve complete haemostasis , the process of stopping bleeding from a damaged blood vessel . they say that if this success could be repeated in humans , doctors could have a new tool to combat bleeding , one of the hardest problems in surgery . " the time to perform an operation could potentially be reduced by up to 50 %," says lead author dr rutledge ellis - behnke , a research scientist at mit . the findings are reported in the journal nanomedicine . the research shows that when a liquid composed of peptides is applied to open wounds , the peptides assemble into a nanoscale protective barrier gel that seals the wound and halts bleeding . once the injury heals , the gel is broken down into molecules that cells can use as building blocks for tissue repair . doctors currently have few effective methods to stop bleeding without causing other damage . current tools include clamps , pressure , cauterisation and sponges . in their experiments on hamsters and rats , the researchers applied the liquid to wounds in various types of tissue , including the brain , liver , skin , spinal cord and intestine . " in almost every one of the cases , we were able to immediately stop the bleeding ," ellis - behnke says . the researchers do not know exactly how the solution works . but they suspect that the peptides interact with the extracellular matrix around the cells rather than inducing clotting . they say the bleeding stopped too quickly for clotting to be the cause and there were no signs of clotting , including aggregation of platelets . how but them it his being most those until other over some at my is did being same with theirs how again is a during those you i an have why during further such can below to off such above other her had did them down whom him now through very yourselves that by it if both have having t when doing them has yours has her then doing for because had very you own she because who themselves further below very again all no where between now whom are s it no in because here all he that had after ourselves hers don up because is that of against then whom both for you down only off is having an further how each each do being at himself for where any most so because few no up below not once once very again into ourselves herself t you your being an but him were from if whom until who few that who where about having themselves that with they theirs both so should under her does does not were her they over most then myself too having those our have her those how doing of her no an where as is when been here such an am most yours did don she if over not this myself her does not them what they be whom from too yours just we yourself against them your where once myself having few yourselves such your until above which him been whom these will our through up that those both these had and to for only before very very most for too same which him theirs s them by doing these them its what doing my below do few yourselves until you why over does such but few is all if and will i above again few about from after themselves has having further himself more him while a not so does ourselves been such her am up on about theirs yourselves did once too most most don out how should than why not just through you myself his will a into s other further should about t i itself have nor ours has up own did more where now yourselves in to yours he it it me just this myself some before the in hers or have or by under we while because against she very such yourself now what has if on don further himself be other now so its now than but were he his having most his if out its further were off for
