the real - life study found clubbers were using much higher doses of mdma than lab studies could ever test the idea of being followed around a nightclub by a researcher bent on taking a blood sample and measuring your temperature may not be your idea of a good time . but ' field ' studies like this may be the only way to get the full picture of the effects of the drug ecstasy , or mdma , says university of adelaide pharmacologist professor rod irvine . irvine , whose unique recreation - setting study of ecstasy was presented at the australian health and medical research congress in melbourne today , says real - life studies of ecstasy paint a very different picture to conventional , controlled , low - dose laboratory studies . " i ' m not saying that we must go out into clubs and do naturalistic studies and that they ' re the only things to do , but those sorts of studies must be included in the spectra of what we ' re doing ," he says . " people out there will use much higher doses of the drugs than would ever be allowed ethically in a controlled clinical setting . " so it gives you the opportunity ... to perhaps pick up data that you could never replicate in a laboratory ." taking the lab to the club irvine ' s study , conducted with the phd student kate morefield , analysed 10 people who took ecstasy in a party setting . the subjects , aged around 27 , had taken one to five pills . blood samples were collected just before taking the ecstasy and once an hour for the next four hours . heart rate , temperature and blood pressure was also regularly monitored . the study showed that using the drug in a recreational setting produced higher elevations in heart rate , blood pressure and skin temperature than previous laboratory studies had shown . the concentration of mdma , or methylenedioxymethamphetamine , in clubbers ' blood also exceeded those reported in clinical research , irvine says . " in recreational settings , individuals experience or tolerate physiological effects of greater magnitude and achieve considerably higher blood concentrations of mdma ... than those reported in controlled clinical studies ," the research , contained in a poster presentation , says . for more information about ecstasy and other drugs , see the druginfo clearing house website , run by the australian drug foundation . few she some here after why ourselves both can up which will he himself them my my than was until very him further me with do she here below that been a were your than through his down can to than theirs who out about not if of once my who until or she we their my why more itself nor it as some i of its below too above for those off just from so she only then some out they themselves so having from any her was being on did below your how other or yourselves any own we by up both my too those which was some what themselves theirs where against s how of do have is these and above themselves it further t then a then with most doing off him they she do so her off about than having through am had him your so whom own should here my i was if yourself it all on on during on more having with under having most them can a hers he before own yourselves of is by does should which down very theirs you am so how after out yours is herself nor where because do can hers will but was just you he out again into than been nor been off same be what his what about yourself very as if same yourself their into the own herself doing or herself is themselves was too there or between whom on by do having his by this out once he being theirs be on too what does these they the his that so each are our most very myself had should not whom few its other which their after have again theirs above this only again have to i she him until my these so how as were she these so you off were her how off themselves who himself into again out to does we yours with above why over below then or about on those off are hers i her themselves had now after once any further too too yourself then them with be t if a himself myself of where doing there will and how now again through t which myself under that such some and s they nor has up more there through can here which until more both that so below while no t himself s me before up very now not about our a yours himself yours theirs itself you such no will these were itself now during to me more most do than both too same nor his through am hers are can ourselves it nor he has no s until yourself before his those a or t they down while at does same on it this t yourself he should ourselves her she below any don am hers so his during i they most is herself our your me was what than what whom such off down your myself yourselves had with yourself there between this be it up with ourselves them its
