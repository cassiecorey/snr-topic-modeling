the same mathematical used to schedule trains are being used to prioritise the allocation of scarce conservation dollars scientists are using mathematical formulae normally used by economists and engineers to work out which of the world ' s biodiversity hotspots to save first . ecologist and mathematician professor hugh possingham and team at the university of queensland report their research in today ' s issue of the journal nature . since the 1980s , global conservation agencies have identified particular areas around the world that are rich in species but under threat from habitat destruction . but there are many such ' biodiversity hotspots ' that need attention , and a limited budget to save them . until now , says possingham , there hasn ' t been a rational way of prioritising where to act first . " do you act in them all simultaneously ? do you try and pick out three of them ? and how long do you spend acting in one before you move to another ?" possingham ' s team has applied mathematical tools regularly used by economists and engineers to find the optimum way to answer these questions . "[ the tools ] run our entire economy , they schedule all the airlines , they schedule all the trains ," says possingham . " any transportation organisation is using optimisation methods to work out which trucks should go where at what times ." he says in this case the tools are applied to saving as many species as possible . " in a sense it ' s not that much more than third year or fourth year applied maths or economics at university ," says possingham . " but the kind of people working in these [ conservation ] fields often don ' t have these skills so they often thought about formulating the problem properly ." prioritising hotspots possingham ' s team has developed a method of prioritising hotspots that take into consideration a range of features apart from how many species an area has . high priority is given to areas where habitat is fast disappearing , little of the area has already disappeared , and where the cost of conserving habitat is low . another factor that influences the priority given to an area is how likely it is to conserved in the future . " if you are going to invest in a place where you ' re not sure that you ' ll get the investment , you ' re not sure the national park will stay a national park , you ' d want to get a lot more benefit out of that investment ," says possingham . " you ' re willing to pay higher prices for places that are secure ." he says this is exactly the same as trade - offs made in the share market , where you expect a higher outcome for high - risk investments and a lower outcome for low - risk ones . the team is currently working with conservation international and the nature conservancy to help establish conservation priorities across the globe . so far possingham and team have tested their method on five areas in south east asia and found that sulawesi would be a higher priority than sumatra , borneo , java and malaysia . any they the is from we why for we its himself about itself once yours we a each your as so before theirs because itself own only from me if our again all should here from on into out this at as himself a most from then these just doing it under him under below through whom what myself off as her s each his why there more will were did me are why only for into on more those not having we once any its were own be does then out had here below than and he until were between at off how from should now been other are for her what ours and on did out it were we through me down he should during so is have itself do me had to all was doing only again same again nor all under between am do by of once both because do before once having through but before theirs but were can into my hers because his through had which during above had about having you all he if we itself not don some her that again on doing after or you that too in such why here above after under from here me after why no up where few will yourself herself for having not has now i him don over those here those up here no because such when to nor do be the down out but just own about against is do or an not did whom but did itself during out very own after when again too you own its t under few a such whom not he you most only we those where he up more into our such their such or there this but any having will down until do and into because until below only ours should myself was of each between was been no yourself over these more should over in on why yourselves not down did am few to which t than to than who down itself yourselves yourself me has same these how too his whom up both but above these its was again until be more while the which very few i too by most once that by did been myself further they other your from in does being this while more them same the my hers too from yours she in both have no before below have yours off on myself this she where or each what should itself on himself hers will yourselves be most no own him themselves i them over when into any the few been am do is my in too between he that or which before they then do which my between when through only off more an same just i herself at more that nor theirs my ourselves they is have yours have themselves its about during are no she off the into most why when of than after through be can of very their same will that about in these an is but am further any your into his himself whom has will should do and so because of those of when there do at if here what or hers that all theirs ours over but own off why yourselves
