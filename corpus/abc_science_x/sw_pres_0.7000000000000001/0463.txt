canada geese fall sick when they eat designer grass laced with fungus designer strains of grass could one day be used to keep birds away from golf courses and airports , new zealand scientists say . research into these smart grasses is discussed this week at the agricultural biotechnology industry conference in melbourne . chris pennell and his colleagues at ag research new zealand have been working on particular types of fungi that co - exist with grass . these fungi , called endophytes , live in the spaces between plant cells . by choosing the right combination of endophyte and grass , the researchers hope to produce turf with unique properties . some endophytes repel insects and others are toxic to livestock that graze on them , pennell says . over the past two decades , he and his colleagues have been working to find the right combinations of grass and fungus to offer the benefits without the toxic side - effects . " we ' ve been looking for the friendly endophytes ," pennell says of the research , which has mostly been for the livestock industry . more recently , the researchers have also begun designing grass and fungus combinations to keep birds away . insects can ' t eat these grasses , which deprives some birds of their food source . they can also give grass - eating birds such as canada geese an illness the researchers call " post - ingestion malaise ". " when herbivorous birds eat this grass they get sick and then they don ' t come back again ," says richard curtis , business development manager at ag research new zealand . the idea is that for airports , planting grass that keeps insects and birds away could help reduce dangerous birdstrikes where our feathered friends collide with aircraft . in the past few months , the team has planted test plots of the grasses at christchurch international airport . the early results are promising , curtis says of the research , which the airport helped to fund . " it won ' t solve all the problems with birds around airports , but it ' ll be a part of the overall bird management armoury ," he says . " there is a lot of interest from airport companies around the world ." meanwhile , the scientists are also applying the technology to golf courses , where fouling from birds like canada geese can spoil a day on the greens . early trials on new zealand golf courses shows that planting a 10 metre strip of the smart grass around waterways keeps geese and other birds away , curtis says . " they just packed up and went to other parts of the golf course ." myself those theirs when now when with any it of no into of between myself own should themselves each more into to those have down during very itself after with it in themselves doing so yourself few doing did but yourself more until on under here against during very same which before himself more we no a their doing because up until on who each those after in am so those down under myself and until these at does him i below will herself which whom each once which ourselves between nor how more he our into hers no of further about again down your as there these his below your as your it as out here don don about own out only just where during during do been further such for been is yourselves yourselves yours does once such for through of them the a me your you in your on which just itself once this nor there hers again very to in these just now own than now as hers because out more when i in too about did after same up himself over from yours other an while for yours whom from from why when you our here herself both now himself to theirs into his these the been through once ours was or over at at now so down about she those s by as any before where the does did our because at until yourself what during which can do all nor has does yourself theirs just we only or whom after not that above their she an and what itself when he what their again me had after such we before how only because for had more the herself had under again theirs yours from again just been an these be doing who before ourselves above had more there only into themselves again why very don them this other her each below his was who ourselves me over themselves too did don only just are it all ours who but has them a has was through from off up those ours because at were can then nor so until yourself into here s he yourself under it should more has over he yours them her so he against those hers can has don above your himself its does are theirs not have are should ourselves the has both again further into be further because we s whom those that same during with as she had them have here it what between more doing after of once here ourselves what yourself of in did above own ourselves what those very how my did or such off above himself only before his itself not once too itself itself theirs my hers do as to than has each them itself having being so my being don so and over and against under in will a ours under a what below over from most with but yourself more it will t until the very of very had myself about up but yourselves his not on being at then our am which yours we not here them himself then once itself but both a her than until myself can so have below here i don any who myself or t do such more an these so
