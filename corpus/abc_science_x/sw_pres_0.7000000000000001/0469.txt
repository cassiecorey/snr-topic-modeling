forget mars this month , say astromomers . look for jupiter instead a repeat of last year ' s spoof email promising that mars will look as large as the moon later this month is causing headaches for astronomers and science educators . they say that the mars hoax appears to be just as resilient as the moon hoax , which denies the moon landings ever happened . for instance , jennie mccormick , education officer at auckland ' s stardome observatory , says stardome , like many other astronomy education centres , has been fielding numerous calls for the past fortnight from people wanting more information about the bogus event . " the email originally dates from the 2003 opposition of mars when the red planet was very bright and spectacular because it was closer to earth than it had been for about 60 , 000 years ," she says . " but it certainly didn ' t and couldn ' t look as big as the moon . you need to read the email carefully to notice that mars would only look as big as the moon through a telescope which had magnified it 75 times ." she says that mars does vary in brightness as its distance from earth changes . "[ but ] without a telescope it will never look much bigger than an ordinary star ." contrary to the email , this month mars will be very low in the sky and only just visible in the west after sunset . teachers have also been fooled by the hoax . " we ' ve had several calls from children whose homework has been to find out what planet is going to be bigger than ever before ," says mccormick . " the hardest thing is having to disappoint children who are clearly excited by what they think they are going to see . that is the sort of thing that turns them off science , when astronomy is something that usually turns them on to it ." however , she takes the opportunity to tell them although mars may be disappointing this month , the giant planet jupiter is well placed for observing . " it ' s actually much more spectacular than mars because it is bright and easy for them to find and , with good binoculars , they can see the planet with four of its moons ," she says . mccormick also tells them to check out the bad astronomy website , which uses science to debunk hoaxes like this . not everyone is as concerned as mccormick about the mars email , like alan macrobert , a senior editor of sky & telescope magazine . " i see it as a good thing , not a bad thing . it ' s an immunisation . if you make a fool of yourself by sending it to your friends and family , you ' ll be less likely to send them the next email chain letter you get , which may not be so harmless ," he says . itself again few only nor he themselves ours few been few had and off few him below just by between now him do yours doing because few no until he just me or has same if once after and too between herself their for will itself from itself into doing this and be why we are what and until been while under than same what which from if all she has does too own each she should herself him off or being over their as a for being very more he are s theirs where own such under up we so more those on and it of some no here themselves same themselves are how do most yourself any during our is ourselves we again against other hers was can s before any some were the but theirs be because if below is to some before how yours any your had out their he all ourselves with all then will being not just when to being such how has its at your be whom there during the you i she when myself or where being am is a is now here hers them yourselves why if me few the our being this is being why having with now once with doing her from below out these yourselves yourselves any i there to have too who through both all them did up your was them own with having who am what all them the other does if of how only having her have very herself where doing its by t can after out we then your have below now itself been do as whom each than same nor those what while are just been which very ours have to same under where been a from not why a very hers off by very because your with too had other against with such until their ourselves between both before before such not my just will very once not more under him other they don yourself as about for ourselves then because some between these being an has herself he over before from t which t i we so some both after were other myself been a does is after between himself himself be so own out ours our above after of between after hers as when nor once whom are under had myself can how own or down were each their herself and does own below had where him having after until such a further hers or can there other where herself ours don been herself until s only am both each too s you more them there am his yours had so after after off can how does at about our i do i such where too your have very i with down itself don again
