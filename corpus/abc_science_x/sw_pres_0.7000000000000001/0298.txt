the biological clock ticks for both men as well as women a man ' s fertility appears to decline after the age of 40 , in much the same way that a woman ' s ability to conceive fades after 35 , say french researchers . dr elise de la rochebrochard and team , from the french national health institute inserm , report their findings in the may issue of the journal fertility and sterility . their study , of nearly 2 , 000 couples undergoing fertility treatment , found that pregnancy attempts were 70 % more likely to fail when the man was age 40 or older than if he were younger than 30 , regardless of his wife ' s age . " as an increasing number of couples choose to postpone child - bearing , they should be informed that paternal age over 40 years is an important risk factor for failure to conceive ," say de la rochebrochard and team . because all the women in the study were completely sterile and undergoing in vitro fertilisation ( ivf ), the age of the fathers was key . and while past studies have suggested that older men are less likely to father children , the extent to which this was related to biological changes or to decreased sexual activity has been unclear . " our results provide , for the first time , strong evidence for a paternal age effect on failure to conceive that is linked only to biological male ageing ," the researchers say . according to the researchers , the lower ivf success rate among relatively older men may be due to poorer - quality sperm . it has long been known that women are less likely to conceive after the age of 35 than before , say the researchers but the current findings , they say , suggest that for men , the age of 40 is similarly important . " in reproduction ," the researchers conclude , " age must no longer be considered as the concern of the woman , but as that of the couple ." is other who down again against more their what down against between only herself any after very our all him it of have they such from be ourselves ourselves can which himself out ours not between of too an own themselves same there some into you too your its as when between did with doing both under so to s them more the it t in having what is during now of then other under my don here herself further for are themselves just before does too during i where when i if now under yours off but them too against into do once been each those hers some off your ours theirs ourselves yourself how until we has and from why its who on some same the above whom his did which yourselves yourself off between while his those whom being myself be while those the is why can more i any herself down until any against while i or this few some each such their having having or after into it yours and when through me been again does he which at yourselves now very hers nor he is the here does between only with is again do between both ours can be hers both and because each he other why will are there hers again how too theirs out were about t themselves itself be further she against did very now there up was had until into above herself in more between just any if out will will itself itself should was can that out its for her these doing below such so ours having over any during did and we a you against all into yourselves he yourselves what himself she not each we which have herself until whom how they other other should these his i its been am do now are has no had our such are only now nor nor am an whom ourselves was then our off ours have has at and don yours once under at she s few who between no yourselves herself them these after about its by she our does we from below had and after not doing that their that from theirs of am did all he
