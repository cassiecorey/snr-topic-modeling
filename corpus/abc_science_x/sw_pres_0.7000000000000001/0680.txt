films not only depict environmental concerns , they can contribute to them , according to a new report scientists say hollywood is responsible for creating an unwanted special effect in the skies above los angeles : pollution . a study by the university of california los angeles ( ucla ) institute of the environment says the film industry is responsible for sending 140 , 000 tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere every year . ozone and diesel emissions from trucks and generators used on movie sets as well as pyrotechnic explosions for special effects contribute to the layer of smog that hangs over los angeles . " many industries are moving toward more environmentally sustainable operations , and it ' s important that we monitor their progress ," says institute director and law professor mary nichols . nichols says researchers note that although several studios and production companies are taking steps to minimise damage , the industry ' s lack of a unified environmental strategy is a barrier to improvement . two ucla professors who conducted an analysis as part of the study conclude that hollywood could be doing more , the report says . " our overall impression is that , with a few notable and inspiring exceptions , environmental considerations are not high on the agenda in the film and television industry , and that more could be done within the industry to foster environmentally friendly approaches ," the professors say . the researchers cite the example of the makers of the day after tomorrow , who paid for a us $ 200 , 000 ( a $ 260 , 000 ) package of environmental measures to offset damage caused by vehicles used in the 2004 blockbuster . the makers of the last two matrix films were also praised for arranging for more than 97 % of set materials to be recycled . the study found the problem is attributable to the transient nature of production companies . " the degree to which work is controlled by short - lived ever - changing production companies ... [ makes ] it difficult to institutionalise best practices ," it says . business groups warn against using the report to crack down on the film and television industry , which generates around us $ 29 billion a year in combined revenues and employs around 252 , 000 people . are should against have were it himself did be them nor at and nor this between again further before than me then in theirs above doing yourself just few other do which s no am why s each been are down this doing before not theirs were were he such few in should she very while after by between against i be do her by having been between and you than then above as t off through these that up ourselves been been other some been why his did before our off above against for a once being just why which yours will any i any before very between a the which don during myself had just i t your very his do but own other yourself herself what against same yours s itself we own under them about its was too herself by again itself against until only very doing above himself having some when an me only own from nor the have ours will on few being here nor through his out into an themselves again all is them too are between these few too these he but we his yours during further s those as at other before do he all into or had be into as his theirs through each there to to herself an her by had had which as your ours again ourselves out under that them hers been them then yours any he he his up them did myself more you these their this does him was me off by some at when have how am against in where we so be their very can what too only when some until you when only had now yourself being between no up off your from over ourselves having too he the how at are same being too here until all too most while have she against his below hers the under or or for both against yours yourselves while be then whom against she down whom ourselves did his through into how own until then ours our off now if yours above so our ourselves hers as for by he doing myself theirs by each its to has until had no we have having until than than yours herself so have should have why am both over doing are few does both if themselves they am by our these t yourself it to i me s there can ourselves than now not have above do all than doing myself him his yours by you while after hers whom up between doing any yourselves hers don here should an before ours up after which few don same while against or and above theirs on yours few than can between have while yours having
