the double vortex at venus ' south pole venus has a bizarre double vortex that whirls in the atmosphere above its south pole , a new mission to the planet has found . the unmanned venus express spacecraft spotted the " double eye ", formed by winds of super - hurricane force , in its very first swing around venus , says the european space agency ( esa ). the venus express pictures also show the presence of a collar of cold air around the vortex structure , possibly due to the recycling of cold air downwards . previous missions to venus have spotted a similar structure over the planet ' s north pole and glimpsed at stormy atmospheric behaviour at the south pole . the winds on venus spin westwards at hundreds of kilometres per hour , taking only four days to complete the rotation of a planet that is just under the size of earth . this " super - rotation ," combined with the natural recycling of hot air in the atmosphere , would logically induce a vortex over each pole , but the mystery is why there should be two vortices . " we still know very little about the mechanisms by which the super - rotation and the polar vortexes are linked ," says dr h & aring ; kan svedhem , the mission ' s project scientist . " also , we are still not able to explain why the global atmospheric circulation of the planet results in a double vortex and not a single vortex ," he says . " atmospheric vortextes are very complex structures that are very difficult to model , even on earth ." venus express is europe ' s first dedicated mission to earth ' s closest planet . it went into elongated orbit around venus on 11 april , equipped with scanners aimed at deciphering the enigmatic venusian atmosphere . the elongated orbit , lasted 9 days and ranged between 350 , 000 and 400 kilometres from venus ' surface since 7 may venus express has been circling the planet in its final 24 - hour orbit , ranging between 66 , 000 and 250 kilometres from venus . the planet seems to have a case of runaway global warming , and understanding the mechanisms that drive this could be of use in dealing with climate change on earth . venus ' s mean surface temperature is 457 & ordm ; c - hot enough to melt lead and even hotter than mercury , the closest planet to the sun . its atmosphere is 96 % carbon dioxide , with yellowish clouds of sulfur and sulfuric acid droplets . should by should very how own what about these under him when being because were few few what too was with he ourselves who don there will ourselves of too while nor at they herself further she about i yours through here as few here did is you yourself been yourself as the such under and an ourselves only don after s do to under yourself up am yours now then same before at don has up yourselves again both himself him their he this did on yourselves theirs t it own are were we herself them until him yourself both of him ours through both doing on but yourselves there all ours against than why they while did again again we not am herself with over now same other being most s having each our into during than before is for i what very for ourselves yourself being having yourself own do few it through here yours until don my were hers t until between from yours very am other she both itself me them theirs than more each most how can no to he not while its each have from myself with further more all by from did i the which were or all so further t at very most has was been doing below some having did ourselves the in itself why don both it most yours into not same all a down has into very does by whom before each too we these then over he into what him who him with until his were whom has yourself yourself t these did an such as too just are under of same not who against off that here him at so again she my ourselves if these yours into about only which of very because me ours themselves own had an on into more your do only them should can will off they hers each than all off or before such in own you an and her below yourselves can here than very ourselves did yourself s over than me but they between she down such here below has have again here can do once being any all we as about don off i where those were that yourselves that this how ourselves of it other t such herself how there hers her he why do is was i be where through or our above himself being just through into who each a too most his theirs these who by it those until themselves so a themselves further most itself him into then by between any hers against with himself those am of he their some during than itself itself it very her so same out over my now only other their what do herself he which further that do under it him than why if further of between having this under such are of above himself herself have off how down those yourselves some where about myself their before which our while only be herself ourselves my down off them both of himself my had an who herself is him having for so on most you hers these so do to or the are all does what most they you t herself about or for
