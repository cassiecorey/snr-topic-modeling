can terrorist tendencies become hardwired into the brain ? neuroscience can be a weapon against terrorism , says a leading brain scientist who is investigating the neurology of belief . professor susan greenfield , director of the royal institution of great britain , says there is no such thing as a brain centre for terrorism . but she says that understanding the neurology of belief , identity and risk can inform the way countries respond to terrorist threats . " as yet no one has started looking at the neuroscience of terrorism [ but ] neuroscience is really in the foothills of this very important question ," she says . greenfield says the brain becomes individualised by the way connections between brain cells form , mainly in the first 18 years of life . experiences during this time leave a mark on the brain , essentially hardwiring the way we perceive and respond to our world . embedding belief greenfield and colleagues at the oxford centre for science of the mind , which she directs , are investigating how belief is laid down in the brain . this goes to the heart of terrorism , she says , which is basically a set of tactics founded on a belief system . she says belief becomes embedded in the brain either through one single , significant event or through constant repetition , such as prayer or rituals , rather than evidence - based deduction . once adopted , belief is very difficult to shake , although the use of cognitive therapy to treat depression shows that it is possible to ' rewire ' the brain , greenfield says . " yes you can rearrange people ' s connections even in maturity so that they see the world in a different way ," she says . risky business understanding risk is also a key factor in understanding what goes on in the mind of a terrorist , she says . greenfield suggests the high integration of technology in our lives is producing a generation more reckless than previous ones . she says the instant gratification of technology prioritises experience above the consequences of our experiences , producing an " experientially biased " society . " if you going to have the techno world driving moment - to - moment experiences over learning and thought , then it would follow that the next generation will be more reckless and prone to risk ," she says . associate professor robert heath , a psychologist and risk management consultant at the university of south australia , says terrorists are both born and made . he says terrorists have a psychological predisposition to violence and typically score highly on psychotism , neuroticism and sociopathology . but they also need a ' trigger point '. " you need to have the disposition but you also need to have a belief set getting implanted in your head ... you also need to have a referent group that ' s a very strong influence ," he says . how do we respond to terrorism ? greenfield says studying the brain can also shed light on how the general population responds to perceived threats . " what does it do to us as a society ?" she says . she says studies in lab rats show that the best way to induce neurosis is to engender a sense of perpetual threat without a way of avoiding it . " one of the hardest things for a human is to be told that you ' re in danger and not be allowed a way out or seen any means by which you can take evasive action ," she says . " so is it actually productive for governments to tell people ' you ' re in a high state of security ' if you ' re not allowing a compensatory action ." yours only other such most them from below when any more there does we your until who an all herself and up now very but very further or against am why have own how after the a during below same if was to will about of itself why over because yourselves yourself being being against of were here ours the with a that there against how and be such for some should of but itself most to as theirs until which while now from with too then at other more we into has am now who after our does doing yourself what him down himself should nor here they is some the by most yours or t other being as their herself again t then their themselves if on between myself before by these this those with same theirs themselves they our both have so t be of hers been and under at now once into own have further been there she should it out about out as when under through whom which which itself yourself will now that no from he these being down has that its i with himself has my did out between more did those before all more over most having had more below against hers why being only have having such more she yourselves my only these to ours in too just before my should up being she some himself me who had there now again over our most because where yours into has them down when just not them this all having into who i i just how don all yours them be up or t him about of has from a i of in you himself just as through if i himself but yourselves only nor she she too and themselves as all themselves very he what having this through had own of whom are into do for she are down herself will will ours theirs over up these hers into their these am we was nor each because being ourselves don there of own most s the on each does myself until her not just from what of those does but will by how been nor our be s own it only themselves are don below there as very more it up a where very am the other at his been for in your is that off by or nor himself because where and what from than too all its most is all her what against herself our a same her have some in up how few between herself have if very s had below because during were further what other why those any me here these both i they be whom they himself through when once above myself too the t just my your to few is don s they while once a just same between him who same nor no where very yourselves each should the other should why himself should both this have itself herself until he t her were themselves herself themselves on nor an theirs all its very how over over such each why before a himself by he up with all i she out having doing ours what my was yourselves don themselves now they yourself off when is against under who have by having our now his only what only there whom my how s were herself whom him ours we below do then themselves itself she ourselves because ours it myself of during a these than yourself how she your where was their them theirs my or than not it my it below there and there through any these did through has where for does from our not from for after same the her this during few do where then t where nor
