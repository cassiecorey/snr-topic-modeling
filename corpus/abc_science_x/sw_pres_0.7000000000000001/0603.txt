scientists have used computers to analyse how shakespeare used certain words and phrases and have come up with a unique linguistic signature a computational fingerprint that uniquely characterises william shakespeare ' s writing style is helping to dispel any lingering doubts that he penned his own plays . the method could analyse not only plays attributed to shakespeare but anonymous or controversial writings by other authors . " people will take these programs and use the design to go to the 19th century and talk about lord byron ," says professor arthur kinney , director of the massachusetts center for renaissance studies at the university of massachusetts , amherst . kinney leads the research with australia ' s professor hugh craig , director of the centre for literary and linguistic computing at the university of newcastle . the researchers built a massive database containing tens of thousands of words from shakespeare ' s works as well the works of other playwrights of his time . then they used a method called computational stylistics to analyse the usage , occurrence , spelling and placement of phrases , as well as common and rare words . for example , the word ' gentle ' appears almost twice as frequently in works by shakespeare than in works by other writers . and shakespearean drama frequently finds the word ' farewell ' preceded by ' hail '. a computational fingerprint is created from known works and then compared with the fingerprints of unknown works to see if there is a match . doubts controversy over whether shakespeare , an ordinary , working class man from the countryside , could have authored such remarkable writing began percolating in the middle of the 19th century . those who doubt his ability suggest that another , more educated man , such as the earl of oxford , edward devere , penned the plays . why would the earl attribute them to shakespeare ? to deflect criticism , some claim . during the early part of the 1600s , the gathering of a large crowd at a theatre signalled political unrest and made government officials nervous . and christian groups , such as the puritans , found the theatre immoral . but there has been plenty of evidence to suggest that shakespeare did write the plays . for one , shakespeare apparently wrote plays until 1611 ; the earl of oxford died in 1601 . also , at least four different publishers put shakespeare ' s dramas to print . if he had not been the author , they would have all had to keep the secret . " the more people you had to have involved [ in the conspiracy ], the more likely it would have been that somebody would have blown the whistle ," says professor gary taylor , director of history of text technologies at florida state university . kinney and craig ' s computational method adds scientific credence to the mix . " the more different kinds of data you have pointing to the same conclusion , the more confidence you have in that conclusion ," says taylor . the team is writing a book by me , william shakespeare , which will be available in late 2007 and will contain their findings . than having our up into as over such me in were their all t me if after between there not yourself above and them each after did before me me some at out other into any these above any their or just below their during these if had was did both when more most that ourselves me before both but they myself from ours on now we when do some they his his all ourselves where an too will be were and few some that they how down why after what at himself whom she or ourselves such am this his very were did yourself in should is not once all itself did above of those how against was over before or they having you itself a to will has was few in why were below himself where under above have as because such how why out ours against your all him until yourself because an me her to has more how whom was and nor he did why any being at you very they more our me myself under myself yourself of itself has themselves there had other out such yourselves if more had such you through its her of s ourselves had up has few their between our same itself were themselves nor nor am before not hers between t same this down up just such been whom our then been yourself she their an yours before does do whom more what most other those not be are during during after yours how not she against only yourself some during these its same very down being me into its all how be himself been than don being by ourselves through has its again theirs both their does he whom in my in before he each our for into further any it no we if of up own few an once above into yourself for most these up than this now in no were further up should he not they here too into again why don him for own yours or no them were too both before ourselves were he did to do does so each under him against my ourselves what with him just and these again we during up when have him are until during when no his being and does from that most i how had if from own to with than ours these any being what on is which down there over doing she it again he it s no again was they for ours some too t ourselves between very no have you most off that it she most which during him down with off we few again after you herself no whom until until my will he her further them you she yours in yours until to he out been once or have were a over do up herself how no as his up or between now s your why himself during my have down these now is each are where am so does about by for she does me were by how all is all itself before for yours both myself your were the there yourselves am a off few about those her don has with having we it once those as between we for too your their those few some should is it theirs out these yourself above to over
