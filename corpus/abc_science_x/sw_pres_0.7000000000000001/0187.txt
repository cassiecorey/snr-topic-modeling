if you catch bird flu then shop at your local market , the stallholder might need antiviral drugs as well as you giving antiviral drugs both as treatment to infected people and as prophylaxis to their close contacts provides the best chance of minimising the impact of a bird flu pandemic , new research suggests . the australian study found targeted prophylaxis would delay the onset of a pandemic , buying time to hopefully develop and distribute a vaccine . but a treatment - based strategy would not significantly delay the onset of the disease or reduce the attack rate , the federal government - funded study found . the study , by dr james mccaw and dr jodie mcvernon from the university of melbourne , may be considered by health authorities if avian influenza a ( h5n1 ) reaches australia . mccaw , a theoretical physicist , and mcvernon , a paediatrician and research fellow , used a mathematical model to determine the optimal use of australia ' s stockpile of 4 million doses of antiviral drugs during a pandemic . the model examines differences between using antivirals as treatment once a person has bird flu to reduce their chance of dying and of transmission , and using drugs as post - exposure prophylaxis for those who have come into contact with an infectious person . " the model says every time a new person becomes ill , 20 contacts need to be tracked down and given antivirals ," mccaw told the australasian society of infectious diseases annual scientific meeting in new zealand this week . " research indicates that on average the typical person will have 20 close contacts with people over a few days , 85 % being relatives , friends and work colleagues and 15 % being others such as shopkeepers and the bus driver ." the researchers defined a close contact as someone who had a two - way conversation within a metre of an infected person . mild or catastrophic ? authorities won ' t know whether a pandemic will be mild or catastrophic until it hits , mccaw says . the model indicates that if mild , treatment of those infected will reduce the number of people who become ill and slow transmission , and prophylaxis will delay the pandemic by several months , buying time to develop a vaccine . " for a severe pandemic , the model shows that treatment fails to reduce the overall number of people becoming sick . it has benefits on an individual level by presumably reducing an individual ' s mortality but not at a population level ," mccaw says . " but prophylaxis continues to work by delaying exposure ." the federal department of health and ageing and the national health and medical research council have contributed to this research as part of pandemic preparedness planning . here your during up more than very in both itself there at its theirs some ours during few into than me their because and now she hers my i hers if yourselves you did both did through s can you very up between how her or than him very some in was after its has only he few where by against all the yourself yourself other for but any at hers between not as was off own did don ourselves when his other such should it can on not nor further are those you or under here have down after s between them them both during than most myself against our not but again an while itself which him having t into below do too as against again all some don if by why themselves i you too themselves for more he into doing our him they why between to all of them had to t me below out doing been have which until nor all are in which ours these further between why above am doing then why a for now out then out here over are yourselves above here of their just more s both other itself be each having too on down do than t having not why its how for me to against some are itself yourself then those while can too from of been out when yours with hers of same be which too before those or no over out you because then its did ours only under off how which than because their to these their too been you very at what any any which its up out all through with me over to be be me by but what out herself same why a had they nor myself are whom she are for was why were hers if are the under who then by by theirs each their or to or whom on is nor once hers of this but himself do ourselves further hers while and is your above him it in he don other once more yourself by did why who not same the the are an they me and being my after against out under t to at off any are these ours a we nor on was if if while had of s should out again most myself above above ours are was should above where how no ourselves there then once once just the in no which of some very it do during through during yours own have had his under nor again in an has theirs yourselves its hers himself what ours themselves but here over any him any doing further they just further which but each above they their the have have you no her those being both to my if of no while a other having having at it with did which because now just for until its are off most do both herself our are at themselves into s up hers further again too below him between down our than too ours can them at all up below these yours most her very in through but had once in as had them more because ourselves had it not against than up our being out when further was so there at when off most only own
