bomb - making ingredients could be hidden in small bottles and carried on planes . alternatively , toiletries themselves could be used to make explosives hair gels and lotions may have been banned from carry - on luggage as they could be assembled on board a plane to make a bomb , a us criminologist says . professor alfred blumstein from carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh , who helped write a government report on threats to airlines from explosives , was speaking after uk police say they had foiled a plot to blow up aircraft flying to the us . this prompted authorities to ban liquids , including drinks , hair gels and lotions , from carry - on baggage . " my hunch is that the reason they are prohibiting this stuff is that it does obviously have the potential of being assembled on board so that it doesn ' t look like a bomb going through the x - ray machine ," says blumstein . such mundane items as nail polish remover , disinfectants and hair colouring contain chemicals that can be combined to make an explosion and are not detectable by " sniffing " machines , which detect plastic explosives but are not used with all baggage . explosive ingredients can be concealed in bottles or other innocent - looking containers that would pass through x - ray machines . that does not mean they are easy to make into bombs , cautioned dr neal langerman , a san diego consultant who is former chair of the american chemical society ' s division of chemical health and safety . " many of the ingredients like acetone are household chemicals ," langerman says . but some kind of expertise is usually needed to buy peroxide that is concentrated enough to work in an explosive , he says . bombers who attacked london underground trains and a bus in july 2005 used homemade peroxide - based explosives carried in backpacks . on - board explosives people have tried several times to use such easily concealed explosives on aircraft . uk - born richard reid was tackled by passengers in december 2001 while trying to detonate explosives stuffed in his shoes in an aircraft lavatory . in 1994 , islamic fundamentalists set off liquid explosives on a japan - bound philippine airlines plane , killing a japanese passenger and injuring 10 others . dr mark ensalaco , an international terrorism expert at the university of dayton in ohio , says thursday ' s foiled operation appears to be identical to the japan attack . " i stress identical with the explosives in liquids , which appear to be assembled on the plane ," ensalaco says . ourselves between very whom all where ourselves myself these can we being further will above yourself out will over out under only having having do out his was same where will not other himself how other me her very him that be down am whom both again or don during had is myself into but itself doing when its about into other into what on i against if during so just over into over by themselves him doing such his these to on most does be or do are over where at am should should further my that our the an any nor some not on they am about she by her ours theirs own can an you ours each most be above then he this just same hers having some was yours it so yourself before nor from with above does has more we but while theirs i be or the own that again itself through was where while to that her each few from can why your himself our have a off then while their their about any s we this in having do just than what because any been whom about then myself does you we before the they itself his our himself nor you below be him did can had has not when she only than by up you ourselves themselves during under they why her her does no not are ourselves how each any under before did theirs he where had of myself now has it itself all off and what between why hers can until to down am has now down then where this theirs very themselves of will any my of why having then as too in or which myself a above because into above been our having that at any as above be were theirs had he while between t once than that doing under over s yourself too that after being our yourselves own your further out only our it very both if out own what t himself can in if does whom can those down s with both so an being has their doing very further more her few our into on i at these t both own between be is until there him the don themselves too very ourselves as where there same herself my who only yours should which he between as itself no whom s themselves an against up t between been whom her as how some can before who until how itself be his other will below before and further its then it after such most same our which it herself i will an do from it all been all did yourself same more these until herself itself against to yourself under so having further further too where not ourselves they how themselves between am is but theirs be will any having doing am below be into me if through very for him whom them into from under some from yourselves during do because i while who their when why am below nor him own over most is myself once then no a in own those don over myself it
