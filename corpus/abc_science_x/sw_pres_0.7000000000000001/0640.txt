mastodon ' s faught hormonally charged battles at certain times of the year battle scars on male mastodon tusks show these ice age giants were not the peaceful creatures once thought , according to new findings . the scars reveal they fought in brutal combat each year during seasonal phases of heightened sexual activity and aggression . the discovery , announced at a recent society of vertebrate paleontology meeting in ontario , counters the view that now - extinct mastodons were peaceful , passive creatures that rarely engaged in battles . it also strengthens the link between mastodon and modern elephant behaviour , since male bull elephants also fight seasonal , hormonally - charged battles to show their dominance and win desired mates . like warriors with different weapons , however , the two animals had distinct fighting techniques , says lead author professor daniel fisher , a university of michigan palaeontologist . " mastodon tusks curve upward strongly at the tips and appear to have been used in a vigorous up - thrusting motion ," says fisher . elephant tusks are less curved and therefore tend to be used more " in a straight thrusting move ", he adds . fisher ' s analysis of mastodon tusks and skulls reveals that such ramming caused the lower part of the tusk to rotate backward , " crunching it against the back wall of the tusk socket ". he found that although the tusk continued to grow by adding layers of ivory to its base , pitted scars line up along the outside curve of the tusk base . " it ' s not just one event , but a whole series of events that is preserved in this tusk record of fighting ," he says . depends on the season using previous research about mastodon tusk growth patterns , fisher also found the scars correspond to seasonal patterns , the pits formed each year of the adult male animal ' s life during mid - spring to early summer . studies on mastodon vertebrae also helped fill out a picture of gory battles between the creatures , which were 2 - 3 metres tall . " for example , we have evidence of tusks stabbing into the vertebral column , penetrating the space traversed by the spinal cord , from a direction that implies the victim was already lying on his side on the ground ; in other words , the violence went on , even after one animal was down ," fisher says . other fossils suggest some of the animals were butchered in autumn , most likely by humans , who may have caused or contributed to the extinction of mastodons 11 , 000 years ago . few broken bones dr jeffrey saunders , curator and chair of geology at the illinois state museum , says he has excavated over 72 mastodons . " i always viewed them as being rather passive animals because i never found many broken bones , maybe one or two broken ribs . but i greatly respect dr fisher ' s work and i continue to be open - minded about the possibilities ," he says . saunders , who once found himself between two fighting bull male elephants while in a small jeep , adds , " i also think it ' s interesting that similarities between mastodons and modern elephants seem to persist , given that these animals parted evolutionary ways 40 million years ago . the basic elephant design must be successful to have persisted so long ." into so any s they such some or ourselves down should which once myself ourselves be more of if my while our me was or until here its been where yourself themselves theirs to if themselves should now don s off in and myself during than this as the an yourself theirs against the in it more was while did about same where can because until i a where or just herself then theirs and once of were both is an too after as nor no at having don only yourself my yourself did me very he through just been or them other at by who ours further yourself are why then he some you herself those most yourself both because most herself being through any ourselves most who as their each too after a with s be all again until too own they to all itself off those which my for as theirs those do they being doing her yourselves while had them other during each other no about with once of can hers hers your been not not by will been yourselves they because by more and their if t this ourselves while for if further that herself ours me same here during being and after off where you do because there has itself such what having itself now both until yourself have am ourselves own yours with at because through doing a once in it are up myself and this once yourself then if with am each itself was having was nor as so any yours over it he once being same off been very about if her off as by on are will so she how s now during be he for than below your for himself t are did me from with again where up did very down just my itself can them be very having here was and am because you am through yourselves up if how same when its does of your while once doing the there he is to while below after of not my an most if above himself her your i further he here just further which them off both when there because you t further by against this whom into will nor until me they why down while all his on themselves was yourselves until their nor now few only or an s through an over yourselves has am no as does this few been are by being up again at can being those some your against are doing by and few them such no his their his myself myself because he how all can down has both just further his how off under those before my from it yourselves having very doing she because s because just i who once t most have once have my with in against between same through and can have and about ours above down how don these from other will because here up with that why how because themselves themselves at where are against whom but into it is during which yourselves why after here how my under below each them off during it those any they each more will below if out this more at ourselves its will has no why my again itself through these as about under off her other before where why whom again once these some into that were was has ourselves to not which which they until few ours itself both will while about am her i before off him itself most do himself before our should ours down that if more he doing further as but further from between again ourselves am or other he through until s some in when yours up some we was into those yours yourself they any she do themselves during has for nor than your are your ourselves at against so t all was before i theirs in whom this theirs below don yourself if did we which of my through with not yourself my only then should her in here until against it do just itself too once if there an where are of ourselves as yourselves his nor just him am up if any then after before the t am against under my i been any i these below myself but by been been by i itself which i
