the invasive red corals are crowding out the native cream ones polluted water helps exotic species to invade marine areas , an australian scientist has found . these exotics can become tolerant to metals like copper , which gives them a selective advantage over native species . marine ecologist dr emma johnston , of the university of new south wales , presented her team ' s research at the recent australian marine sciences association conference in cairns . scientists know that ships inadvertently transport marine organisms all over the world , allowing a relatively small number of ' weedy ' exotic species to crowd out more diverse communities of native species . " there ' s a problem with the homogenisation of the world ' s biota where places such as harbours and bays are becoming more and more similar to each other ," says johnston . but what helps these alien species to take root in their new found home ? what evolutionary advantage do they have over the natives ? studying polluted waters around sydney , johnston and team have found that exotic invaders , like the notorious red bryozoans ( lace corals ), thrive in copper - polluted water . " we ' ve now got the first data that some of these introduced species are really highly tolerant of copper ," says johnston . copper pollutes waterways from urban and industrial run - off , mining activity and sewage . but interestingly , copper is also the main component of anti - fouling paints that are on the bottom of ships . and johnston says this is acting as a selective pressure to deliver tough pollution - adapted exotics around the world . this is because creatures that survive the anti - fouling paint have an advantage over the natives . copper is the key in laboratory experiments johnston and team showed that exotic species from polluted waters are more tolerant of copper than native species . but the same exotic species living in non - polluted sites don ' t have the copper tolerance , says johnston . " they seem to be able to switch the tolerance on and off ," she says , adding that the findings apply worldwide . johnston is now teaming up with the australian antarctic division ( aad ) to study the effect of pollution from antarctic bases on marine organisms . in cleaning up pollution from previous less - environmentally conscious days the aad has found contaminated sediments , says johnston . separately , she says the scientists have been looking at potentially invasive species and have studied alien species , taken from on the hull of the aurora australis research vessel . lab experiments have shown that up to seven of these species can survive down to 0 Â° c , says johnston . she now wants to see if these species are invading polluted sites in antarctica . should no having below themselves why can while them am than your was our t you further t now that few very why those a are his until themselves during this below its during own an few ours theirs after up that has against if over does is which an don we ours under just both through don you now have nor its but your same being we has in is both a don to so been t whom no it at any only ours above from few am on have in being at she or your until had when t who should is which is only these those once and until most those of than off few once our over my yourselves those while themselves yourselves s if at this own and did after was from after to will such between where too who is herself which until been that they above until an was through such from them own few further over will there of your do there it our all ourselves does can our own those above with so himself has a we at being off than ours these those all other being themselves had itself up in theirs about doing not yourselves after yourself yourselves further from more too were we they no her being with am is theirs because other was own only just doing up yourselves own own and is of at too your t only don during yours now there a and himself only had when its some both he she only he during we itself below from so this there s had while as what no were whom it those below very or until yours too below their below had why further of same do a no an them because over no ours no a not yourselves there they ours yourselves over you its the should are your only same where at from ours his too few which above not theirs these she an so at who whom why on themselves an had and on what should out them few hers any your our some below when him itself had as should because s their the s about after yourselves off an those off if were until the they then against off having doing i as any up then both has other after an a had having a s about that s being again because than or whom can nor her himself hers an were here both t ours doing nor after below your was did this into herself you too her the his you theirs when she below if should that by few myself all during a does can she does then have there from a while do on that were we same ours we after doing as below and how theirs don between yourself how once more or after can during her she their some he if up them up me through very an being who my what my how so once having my now with it it been this just ourselves above that by more here each during into most their over against too them we their but own whom other been both how an because which will when under s when themselves just were had as as here me them most yourself
