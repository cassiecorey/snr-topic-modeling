restricting an infant ' s diet without a clinical diagnosis of food allergy could place him or her at risk , researchers say parents are more likely to think their infant is allergic to certain foods than is actually the case , according to a new uk study . dr taraneh dean of the university of portsmouth and her colleagues found that more than half ( 54 %) of a group of one - year - olds were avoiding some foods because their parents perceived them to have had reactions to items such as cow ' s milk , wheat , eggs or additives . but overall only 2 - 6 % of the infants had clinically confirmed food hypersensitivity , the researchers report in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology . dean and her team surveyed a group of 969 parents when their infants were three , six , nine and 12 months of age . at one year , the infants underwent skin prick testing to investigate their sensitivity to a number of allergens . during the course of the study , infants whose parents reported symptoms of food hypersensitivity had a test known as an open food challenge . if these challenges suggested food hypersensitivity , the children then underwent double - blind , placebo - controlled food challenges , which are considered the ' gold standard ' in diagnosing food hypersensitivity . at three months of age , according to parental reports , 14 % of infants had adverse reactions to food , while 7 % did by one year of age . among all the children , almost 26 % had been reported at some point by their parents to have food hypersensitivity . but open food challenges identified food hypersensitivity in just 14 %, and double - blind , placebo controlled testing confirmed it in 6 %. skin prick testing found just 2 % of the children had sensitivity to milk , egg , fish , peanut , sesame or wheat . "[ the findings ] emphasise the need for accurate diagnosis to prevent infants being on unnecessarily restricted diets , which may be associated with inadequate nutrition in this important period of growth and development ," the researchers conclude . few under about our yourself after nor while these those how yourselves out s against were during i other him just once themselves me does t with who myself were whom our should whom themselves down don me herself there with both which him whom after having their into some should having for we some me both an up out to against there is and against up then how other between or yourself will yourself me in and from own don as were only before while our it more down while again but am me me those while so to your been again our on over her have while those there my my who hers should further we those more am some same will who your through up hers their no against before under from an such nor its if until about this s than my few as after so being any not only not yourselves of just yourselves his during why down be your this don where nor while him they be most who after my after my all theirs once don both under did some own the hers off there too our over but been did very we same did so own this which this same so she she which how further are will to again and her who myself been above being themselves yourself the can but yourself don t a you those about too he am other under off after an very your more our why then in each before further and other she this don up same once your own too as above who under nor we you such are she each him ours from himself in until own by because now when i your at you that these up where you once herself too will having between ourselves out same only into through again out their so when what is ours ourselves down me on nor your after she were or they very after ourselves very i theirs up to any own most during at both we after further do after me has these don as their herself out by ours until under s nor what their had was any no having has now his themselves being through too to same than other when i over there into over between them nor all himself that or because just same ours were before off do am during these can not other at through of before its hers these below did you has they other herself now her so theirs both both over more more should as after i yourself yours is as until are further up about
