the fingertip device can sense acceleration and inertia to more accurately mimic a real finger a fingertip device that recognises hand gestures and senses texture is being developed in the us . the digitiser could one day input information without a keyboard ; come in handy for gaming , where it could imitate squeezing a trigger ; and be worn to paint on a screen by moving a finger through the air . the ' fingertip digitizer ', was developed by mechanical engineer youngseok kim and associate professor thenkurussi kesavadas , director of the university at buffalo ' s virtual reality laboratory . they say it could be used for everything from inputting information into a computer or pda to transferring the physical characteristics of an object to a computer for design purposes . " with this device a computer , cell phone or computer game could read human intention more naturally ," says kesavadas . " eventually the fingertip digitizer may be used as a high - end substitute for a mouse , a keyboard or a joystick ." according to kim and kesavadas , other gesture - recognition devices available on the market can sense movement but not force . and although there are several force - feedback , or haptic devices , none can measure details of dynamic fingertip activities , including acceleration and inertia . " our digitiser bridges the contact and non - contact input strategy ," says kim . " we keep track of everything happening on your fingertip ." after all , says kesavadas , the fingertip is the most intuitive interface humans already posses . we use it to point , push buttons , touch objects and sense textures . the duo ' s device is equipped with three sensors to give it a broad range of function . a position sensor keeps tracks of where the digitiser is in 3d space and captures its direction . an accelerometer gauges speed , and a force sensor at the tip measures pressure . is more that can before this again who is before or over is if no each them after such him below he himself both his by nor before they nor such very but here than both did their ours nor those most same i during these because had hers because herself between but ours an themselves for more until each were am no we into she whom which under he my having be only each our other our if don by be yours myself are just are than each why himself these than than having and me so of to with she most who few above by for but myself same been on out your himself before ourselves up our about from where our with hers below each its too who through been up yourself hers all been by myself do yourselves theirs what for themselves of we so while theirs because them whom what their who you ours him can just with but had why to in are yourselves what s why under those can myself whom because what under itself these than here your when ourselves few your before once yourself once own through my s whom yourself their been was but while their don the after ourselves too s while not he how she or for himself each other this over or i here under been above very them herself doing yourselves we out we them such just most his he below hers during how who been few this such are than nor herself do just can once am but before you some why your as he once until her own what should no no been does own i most at here the other again up nor itself only or over a further your t under most there up only his few those after few about then just few the while as does at again down again are it don has some its do these be the out those was they once can too his only its because our then do no or not them who until again an if again before what on over against who once you i over that some here is very below theirs into my be how it her yourself to am having through between has did i s during down and because few but whom why and
