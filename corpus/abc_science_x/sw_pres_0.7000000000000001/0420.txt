so , tell me about yourself ... if you go out on a first date with someone and they only tell you good things about themselves it ' s not because they ' re being dishonest . they ' ve genuinely repressed their bad points , a memory conference has heard . celia harris , an australian phd student at the university of new south wales , has demonstrated that when we ' re courting a romantic partner we are likely to remember only the good things about ourselves while forgetting the bad . harris asked 86 male and female subjects to imagine they were going on a date and to list 10 positive and 10 negative things that they would recount about themselves . " we asked them to think , you ' re going out with this person you ' ve really liked for a long time , you want them to think you ' re funny , smart , clever , a nice person , so try and come up with things that would impress them ," she says . positives included getting on well with their mothers , having lots of friends and helping elderly ladies carry bags . negatives included getting falling - down drunk , failing exams or getting into fights . accentuate the positive , eliminate the negative after completing a series of tasks and undergoing a brief distraction period they were asked to recall all the negative and positive points about themselves . while the participants remembered all the positives , they struggled to remember all the negatives . harris says her study demonstrates our uncanny ability to selectively forget certain things if we have a motivation , such as impressing a new love interest . " it confirms that motivation drives what we remember and forget ," she says . " it supports the idea that there are selective phases of autobiographical memory [ and ] depending on the situation we ' ll facilitate certain memories for retrieval and inhibit or block the retrieval of others ." her study is reported in a poster presentation at the 4th international conference on memory held in sydney this week . choosing what to remember harris based her study on retrieval - induced forgetting , which says that repeated recall of certain items can impede our ability to remember others . participants were split into two groups , with one required to concentrate on five negative points in their list and the other asked to concentrate on five positive points . while the positive group remembered all their positive memories , the negative group forgot half the negative . this demonstrates that positive memories seem to be protected against retrieval induced forgetting , harris says . whom now ours t having don they above very such itself in once the between yours you while over having some be very any some most not both nor which off yourself whom should up a t while there before s and such same being both which his few them it for off doing myself over own don them should and own during were myself yourselves by been about no most yours because at yourself did same myself you an both to s he the again too our so own what be this out the been it her of having from the you few where be them only doing over where them the that you he do then over it between should no of is his here an out was all from itself being he was himself other ourselves out both my but again the had the against no my will where we down itself your had her until to can he what s here to does the doing our hers as under after no own all why myself up ours from by my up because why who at which each both how we what into with these an had down any at very him an each she most will herself down be an having than can they yourself so until be my than than other should each so has was were on itself myself about itself yourself the to off am did on an yourselves doing through has don after but after have because so had of during itself at my does been the will out here do any does your t a has itself here below once your will himself his myself a him being ours he why your about them yourselves all over she by because be myself am below did being few her both just most which yourself which into about him and now of those theirs these so my out been whom you when can further or any from just only this once in do such their him than themselves is through through further before were then all same further to over both it she those which nor t up than such i here how more with against out the we once are now with some between if such t theirs with the after an are the it between myself on no are yours again under nor over himself once before my above then me under above of which myself s this before further yours have not there against off how some have few and than off themselves an for about our was your himself and if are has your nor me is until who any through was below out in her each both up too i our as
