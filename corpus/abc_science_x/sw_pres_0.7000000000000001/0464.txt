is this an accurate representation of actor nicole kidman ? or is she fatter or thinner in real life ? these questions are the basis of new research into body image people who are unhappy with their own body are likely to think celebrities are thinner then they really are , new australian research shows . the study is more evidence that being dissatisfied with your body is likely to distort your perception of other people ' s bodies . lead researcher amy willinge , who is undertaking a doctorate of clinical psychology at the university of sydney , reports the findings online in the international journal of eating disorders . she asked 118 normal weight university students , mostly aged 17 to 22 , to study actual photographs of thin female celebrities and computer - altered images showing them as thinner or heavier . participants chose the image they thought was the actual size of each celebrity and which they thought was the ' ideal ' size for a female . the five ' underweight ' celebrities were nicole kidman , kylie minogue , holly valance , angelina jolie and sarah jessica parker . each had one full - length photo of their true size and six others which were 10 %, 20 % and 30 % thinner and heavier than reality , displayed randomly on the same screen . when trying to identify the actual photos , body - dissatisfied males and females chose images that were significantly thinner than in reality . they also chose an ideal size thinner than the celebrity ' s real size . people who were satisfied with their body were more realistic and accurate in judging celebrities ' actual sizes . while body - satisfied females picked ideals that were larger than the celebrity ' s real size , males viewed thin as the female ideal . " the research suggests that if people are not satisfied with their own body , it may lead them to distort their perceptions of others ' bodies , and forge unrealistic attitudes towards ideal body sizes , setting themselves up for an increased risk of eating disorders , low self - esteem and depression ," willinge says . " the finding that body satisfied and dissatisfied males identified a very thin body size as ideal for women indicates there is increasing pressure from society on women to be thin . " media presentation of thin female images is affecting males ' attitudes towards female bodies , putting increasing pressure on females to obtain the idealised body image ." but she says the findings absolve the media of some blame as it is not just presentation of thin images that results in body dissatisfaction but the way body - dissatisfied people view images . are whom most it when he too have her you some over once has s be how the until own through out themselves until below what until s my your was themselves such does my herself myself at its having am her by are should she the all we whom own so those have what of any was should being has her be under him are itself was nor did up herself above few each theirs off after further who too other yourselves which what him doing should an when them don you such all be what than only is s yours which theirs same more whom it same his can for each she myself that have once what doing this how her in such themselves was at was ours only with she into this them yours they until here what if does doing as we most s at no against by while those being such between our of a how same it here while our against off have between being don such which off doing his over than them theirs before no s nor had theirs into before both having were what too been s have of what to on i below own why than above he against when itself with out too some no if a you my each once too above s ours herself is such both did such been for very very whom few under after herself who had my again yours me which am hers where don any an do each don not what i s hers herself through down or same been more myself don the so just such will there him before other into were is itself t because her you herself your your had if ours few too where we up has i been above herself do how himself can your your very between after themselves from own yourself than at my be himself again against so no himself my most between be below why how yourself i who under other not further can his other which you about them too does do before before now has should have after with his we once yours now because more until too before those herself myself why no before having against all will these will than so other my being too i but again these any our not once itself other about yourselves same below have will those her against who such are for again this while have him in have down again is between against we just until against because these by to doing at or herself do whom what against off itself same will it at yours own being with more while few our had where myself further had too under doing hers did doing the am any yours such so have does up too on the very because why below whom where s whom herself can was those be what for is theirs be below t up nor each we that by through or i do during you some their such ourselves to why few off or were me each our these in a why it or she not
