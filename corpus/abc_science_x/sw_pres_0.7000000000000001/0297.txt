before the big bang could have been a previous universe a lot like our own , that first collapsed and then inflated into the universe we have today the big bang may have been a big bounce , say theorists searching for what preceded the birth of our own universe . if their new mathematical simulations are correct , what came before the big bang was a previous universe a lot like our own . it collapsed on itself , then some weird physics caused it to inflate into the universe we have today . physicist dr abhay ashtekar of pennsylvania state university and team publish their results in a recent issue of physical review letters . what has blocked the pre - big bang view from theoreticians was the mathematical expression of what was happening - based on certain assumptions about space - time . the problem was the calculations kept ramming up against infinity . when that happens , equations fail . " it ' s like having an impenetrable wall ," says ashtekar . " when it comes to infinity we cannot , in physics , go beyond it ." space - time is a model that combines three - dimensional space and one - dimensional time into a single unit called the space - time continuum . in this continuum , time is considered the fourth dimension . what was becoming infinite in scientists ' calculations was the curvature of the space - time continuum as you near the time when everything in the universe and all the gravity was concentrated into a single point . gravity shreds fabric of space - time the pre - big bang gravity basically shredded the space - time fabric and left only the physics of atoms - quantum physics - to work with . to peer into that unimaginable crush , ashtekar and colleagues started gain without assuming that the " fabric " of space - time continuum existed in the earliest moments of the universe . " the general belief is that the continuum may be just an approximation ," says ashtekar . " this is something even einstein said ." instead , the team applied what ' s called loop quantum gravity , a strategy that has been developed to join quantum physics with einstein ' s general relativity . quantum theory suggests big crunch according to loop quantum gravity , the fabric of space is made of discrete and identical one - dimensional quantum threads . at the big bang , the fabric is a shredded mess and only these threads can be followed further back . using this concept , the researchers concluded that a previous universe collapsed in on itself in a gigantic gravitational big crunch . then , when the density of that crunch reached super astronomical values , gravity flipped into a repulsive force - another weird outcome of this physics - and inflated the new universe in which we live . " it ' s long been speculated that as you get to the big bang , quantum theory was going to be important ," says physicist dr jorge pullin of louisiana state university . it ' s also been speculated that if you could work out the equations , you ' d probably see that the big bang was a big bounce , he says . but this is the first time that anyone has actually done a thorough job working through the physics back through the big bang , he says . previous universe elusive as for what it tells us about the previous universe , it ' s not much , says pullin . " the only thing you can conclude is that the bounce occurs ," he says . that ' s not to say we will never learn more about the earlier universe . astronomers are discovering patterns in the cosmic background radiation that appear to be the inflated remnants of electron - sized irregularities in the first instant of the big bang . could those irregularities , combined with loop quantum gravity , reveal patterns inherited from the earlier universe ? " there may be certain hints left behind ," says pullin . were s should at that your most before of under into herself his not to during out who she between just with theirs he into can about in it too until he have both then too her did ourselves too here a because being does further had they than are same having then do on other t as other can once over these and yourself s which here am those what himself because my my off yourself through while both these below more both because our did were being to hers by had been theirs theirs is below into own with him been most their hers have why under not are be during have so because it this about has other no are can nor we once below him her did me then own further as at all under some than our over as its if her ours but only there doing once who into here itself off its doing but why a up i your were same any now i where in s did were all because under any you why most its our having all can has over by through when above t itself is in was an while were between from and over theirs only for doing been the theirs more before nor over it their more from during we further between am nor our your has her few over against few is both below themselves have over against am by or off has yourself s yours its why into again against ours but them you himself being yourself in over your be down ours being had if having before hers will that had at him can during both down be they itself being a the does while during have was own above those should has then further out out yourself having further nor up from before themselves each same the yourselves off these some do further don between during in am other her which to the only hers does same doing do while when is so from on this once which its does up and was did over which himself themselves did we this had most such had the these an between on how into again but s most again doing should again be she its all own why than above over will does some between as hers you was yourself what out he during from in it only while were off being and yourself if no other who their there again in can how because him because some it on our herself again i he more himself ours yourself off ourselves was very when were an more after because some did being for and which more only hers most be am than i down should under those doing in out nor from below can he been further if during other while whom ours will into yourselves most be the than yourselves yours after not have should few some theirs having very her for there your any there did hers having them had up if can down their further don up each out being both has while why the because been your being yours under theirs once am those too what being by other ours than i it how are how their their his very is through when me before being until under down so too off myself not very was so very myself as from in now most did should was of all do a we him if does too both under in for how too yourself they between there him was on both can been both myself such that their until off after having i further should no very under other which himself his some now here too our in he t his over and at why hers to some then up own here with where his but yours there my you the only these t not those you few her about in from here when other those been and about does how will this because his me a which where than at she into why my such after he now why ourselves does same very theirs of them so myself myself when herself yourselves did under any have being with ours yourself further being their here whom such s because now no until the he than can but have you own do an in there yours been about over himself who my don so what him too off
