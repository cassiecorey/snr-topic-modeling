adding an immune system booster to diluted vaccines may mean a little vaccine goes a long way much smaller doses of vaccines may be needed to combat outbreaks of bird flu , tuberculosis and sars than once thought , canadian research shows . the research by a team at the university of british columbia could mean more shots will be available . the team led by professor wilfred jefferies says standard doses can be reduced 100 - fold and still be safe by adding an immune system booster commonly found in the human body . the study shows that when the immune system booster is added at low doses to vaccines and injected into mice exposed to rabies , measles and smallpox , an immune response kicks in to protect them from infection . the so - called tap molecules deliver peptides inside cells from the body ' s immune system or vaccines . if this transporter is switched off , as in cancerous cells , disease fighters cannot be moved where they need to go within the cell to do their job . the results of the seven - year study were published in a recent issue of the journal plos pathogens . " this new paradigm is shown to be applicable to many viruses , including poxviruses , and could significantly advance the creation of new vaccines and improve those that already exist ," the scientists say . this could prove especially important if the h5n1 bird flu , expected by many to be the next worldwide pandemic , begins to pass between humans . what happens in a bird flu outbreak ? bird flu has killed some 85 people since emerging in asia in 2003 . experts say it could kill millions if it mutates into a form easily passed between humans . it could take up to six months to develop a vaccine should human - to - human transmission occur . with smaller dose sizes , a hundred times more vaccine shots could be made within the same period of time . " we ' re hoping it will be incorporated into a number of different vaccines ," says jefferies . " it ' s powerful because we think it can make general vaccines much better ." smaller doses will also make some vaccines , including that for smallpox and anthrax , less toxic and therefore better tolerated by those with weaker immune systems , jefferies says . hiv patients , in particular , could benefit , as well as up to an estimated 20 % of the population who react badly to vaccines . " some pathogens don ' t currently have effective vaccines ," says co - author timothy vitalis . " i hope the technology can be used to solve some of the needs in controlling infectious diseases ." how do you boost a vaccine ? jefferies first imagined the possibility of this application for vaccines after noticing that tap is turned off in cancer cells , meaning that the body ' s natural immune defense does not recognise that it needs to attack these cells . he found that when tap was added to the cancerous cells the immune system suddenly ' switched on ' and fought back . " tap is a key molecule in the creation of immune responses ," says jefferies . " this molecule fought viruses when it was found in normal amounts in the cell . i thought , ' if a little bit is good , is a lot [ of tap ] even better ?" researchers say they are not sure why the tap molecules are turned off in cancer cells , but hope further study may eventually lead to a new cancer treatment too . but that is still years away . jefferies says the team is currently trying the method out with prototype vaccines that could lead to clinical trials in the next two years , depending on funding . the research was primarily funded by the canadian institutes of health research . theirs so he itself all theirs i very off are its can after very few up herself just other to into you them they both further the above why has a other herself have my my for because i at very very be themselves by their whom then t t with while we both what further is were hers has do against they further such be itself from why yours more because before did then through until below very most which them no as very other above by the below myself after can nor because very be had them for of some i until down don being against our further yours he of out has what herself yours then were were how have by but after having into if on those against both too yourself himself have myself ours most than there me when through on your or own yourself some them s those then why are so very theirs themselves against by doing what down or most over had than being all each itself here is herself been whom as other has from while our him i they before are were having while were further am between down so very into theirs just again them a his you own off but he which out own or not don few in he being she your should him those his ourselves here or all theirs themselves ours can am while was were are there to itself him them been very against when s herself have ours by below than but by then each where them s what theirs during too in off here she above these his hers any very with here before nor not other your them don him has during our above too had was then s because you myself how against him he ourselves t ourselves been up being same why in this himself too not now have don his until now again were does in is such because against her as did myself how of were these their of over yourself but why i ours below those where me being his down no her from own t should with further am further by my of here above then don most him am above for ourselves to now i as will it they have same these yours into over any its before been me have until in yourselves only what don below why in he am then same between most those we don down more with in with from of yours should if them above then if who same yourselves by of few once all her whom just your are we that same your above did into me just hers do some an those own now at if through t through than she did as too did here some don for this out again me against below both do him both t ourselves is then myself ourselves between at over not just s are and are she same has because into is this only once his your than at not up him himself herself in i over them did don nor why it it in myself not its just a this to himself be has them it his own has below once with some while been whom and will off when had whom some of will theirs whom out yourselves too had should she them if we any in here should if how why only his on does here by each for but above which between how most so ours before my what him have during on down why after am me before because on its was those it if into when same this because all each same had me hers doing just his down them while for too yourself so only and hers you a very there up can s no and into were those yours their here its on on over between itself more here them does and up yours s myself her its a t here during themselves they doing our as yourselves am from theirs with few does me all are what they has with who during itself over in or having up his was through has after a can yourselves into through up they her over been her him to our while theirs all any both with its itself so of me in be after only being myself once off am all while before ours were yours been with until through when too now themselves doing doing were very just very again whom our my
