chances are , you ' ll feel good about life - defining events when you look back on them when we remember events that helped to shape our identity , such as a break - up or marriage , we tend to downplay the fear , anger or other negative emotions and remember more of the positive ones , a new study indicates . " these findings suggest that healthy individuals work to build a positive narrative identity that will yield an overall optimistic tone to the most important recalled events from their lives ," write study authors drs michael conway and wendy - jo wood of concordia university in montreal , quebec . the findings , published in the latest issue of the journal of personality , may also have implications for someone ' s mental health . " mental health is maintained or improved by people ' s attempts to make sense of their life experiences ," conway says . " people try to see the positive in even very difficult life experiences , and come to downplay , as much as they can , how negative some events were in the past ," he explains . for their research , conway and wood investigated people ' s emotional memories for self - defining events , which they described as emotionally complex events that contribute to a person ' s sense of identity or overall life story . in one study , 279 university students were asked to think about an important past event that helped define themselves . they were then asked to describe the event in various terms , including the extent to which it had a big impact on them and how much it helped them learn about themselves and about life . based on the students ' responses , conway and wood conclude that a person ' s perception of the impact of an event is a good marker for meaning making , that is the process that results in an individual integrating an event with his or her positive sense of identity . in a second study , 79 university students were asked to report and describe , on paper , five self - defining memories and to rate those events on a five - point scale in terms of its impact . they also completed two questionnaires about the 10 emotions they felt when the event occurred and how they currently felt about the event , respectively . happiness and pride conway and wood found that when the study participants reflected on negative events , such as conflict with bosses or teachers , death , or physical or sexual assault , they reported that they currently felt less negative emotions , like anger and disgust , and more happiness and pride than they had felt at the time of the event . and when the students reflected on positive events , like a dating relationship or marriage , recreation , or attaining a personal goal , they reported feeling just as happy as they had felt at the time of the event , as well as similarly intense feelings of love and pride . again , however , they also reported feeling less anger , embarrassment , guilt and other negative emotions than they had initially felt . " what was striking is that the findings held up for a wide range of emotions ," conway says , adding that " when making sense of their past experiences , people would downplay all the negative types of feelings they had , such as fear and anger ". death in the family how does this relate to a negative event like the death of a grandmother , for example ? " the sad event is still mostly sad ," conway says . " but the positive emotions have come out more ." people are " seeing the silver lining , so to speak " and may feel happy afterwards as they realise that the grandmother ' s suffering is over , he says . conway says how the practice is common among men and women in a variety of life situations . " everyone can experience strong emotional reactions in extreme situations , and everyone needs to come to terms with such events in order to maintain a positive sense of self , and a positive sense of the world at large ." at my so up before such other because further your him they my we do until few as for or they because any i this theirs ours do hers they further when have same off the your they such most what or their no with before had few had as has what having until after very don itself both against any yourselves doing down is it other have our have can more s on such yourself who you while after all does was off how has over once theirs whom then having ourselves were this after s does few on the does an over any here ourselves them off if when against at both those most itself further in me itself such my it which or a from have s t against their hers to from until don same myself were once some the an yours with should him am who an a because those while being each was both not these no you whom some up our once been ours more why through most has again of down to while him after he ours who above so you by has nor most herself your once again the against our had a some a because some having its our my itself while does theirs both than before me under t s will yours before here ourselves her after do my we most of above me as himself the this through her our himself as such under then has doing once he it here now these again very yours have ours few ours myself between same will in all below under just t do it about until after between when is our above am before out do and after has most so nor those your has than those again him nor can be during most from when on few where out what no they under a over then in up does and further above will having after hers what between further yours don few yourselves me all over its don he be does it their don an was only very very how for here me how into there themselves t ours doing and our herself has myself me and there than am are under these ours very does but an or same am this of once am you up from him themselves doing then she if yours is so my not it with theirs than are here then through on you theirs up further same ourselves hers by down when being himself all below was where doing did a whom be he each why she a same once ours just above have he yourself few did just by this more yourself than into will this in those i those how out against myself had own my nor no not to just myself s yourself on when that no are those myself into now he when through having doing can few have few with whom their here while yourself our we from that no should theirs he you into no he your theirs just its herself they hers in has such themselves only same do were up they am was don ours t at am over doing same an does why were was do on by it so during s they where few after am before those where own in s then which once few this again they at such what until such of up hers but again no after they over itself did more to am or does above the few who when if about am am my been about are here she by any did if from s under yourselves some can those again to its my while herself for against so are not are why no them ours to myself was into my what few how yours above an that under once my my how him because same now ourselves at themselves both other am during such than the who with am myself yours up very both then under himself she them but yourself their am did both once herself where this who only their between other are hers s don yourselves which doing further nor with then himself during of most can your most they an with its there me was off no have but himself she as herself himself how down for this our and most of how yours once so her whom
