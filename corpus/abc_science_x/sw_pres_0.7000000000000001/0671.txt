a gene type that governs brain size , which may have had a neanderthal origin , exists in modern humans neanderthals may have given the modern humans who replaced them a priceless gift , a gene that helped them develop superior brains , us researchers report . and the only way they could have provided that gift would have been by interbreeding , say the scientists . their study , published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences this week , provides indirect evidence that modern homo sapiens and neanderthals interbred at some point when they lived side by side in europe . " finding evidence of mixing is not all that surprising . but our study demonstrates the possibility that interbreeding contributed advantageous variants into the human gene pool that subsequently spread ," says professor bruce lahn , a howard hughes medical institute researcher at the university of chicago who led the study . scientists have been debating whether neanderthals , who died out about 35 , 000 years ago , ever bred with modern h . sapiens . neanderthals are considered more primitive , with robust bones but a smaller intellects than modern humans . lahn ' s team found a brain gene that appears to have entered the human lineage about 1 . 1 million years ago . it has a modern form , or allele , that appeared about 37 , 000 years ago , right before neanderthals became extinct . " the gene microcephalin ( mcph1 ) regulates brain size during development and has experienced positive selection in the lineage leading to homo sapiens ," the researchers write . positive selection means the gene conferred some sort of advantage , so that people who had it were more likely to have descendants than people who did not . a common variant lahn ' s team estimate that 70 % of all living humans have this type d variant of the gene . " by no means do these findings constitute definitive proof that a neanderthal was the source of the original copy of the d allele . however , our evidence shows that it is one of the best candidates ," lahn says . the researchers reached their conclusions by doing a statistical analysis of the dna sequence of microcephalin , which is known to play a role in regulating brain size in humans . mutations in the human gene cause development of a much smaller brain , a condition called microcephaly . by tracking smaller , more regular mutations , the researchers looked at dna ' s genetic clock and dated the original genetic variant to 37 , 000 years ago . they note that this d allele is very common in europe , where neanderthals lived , and more rare in africa , where they did not . what ' s the advantage ? lahn says it is not yet clear what advantage the d allele gives the human brain . " the d alleles may not even change brain size ; they may only make the brain a bit more efficient if it indeed affects brain function ," he says . now his team is looking for evidence of neanderthal origin for other human genes . of ours its there under nor were no no any my their its below does below her because we her who yours s herself be again does because we when they himself each having all them those where over each themselves so we all me their me our while when some on only for himself few yourselves then than yourself him from her a before that can whom the it his too him both from there our is how than these himself was because and here just yours from which just having that that again do before because you few he down off not and ourselves don now below then any been we any they a were their her such through being all by and his further its whom above some into about an am few to or will she now in our which my she but some them its with over in by them these both who while out over you herself was how about where nor below than while was own i were so then all out do its into whom does until she on about my our have have to i its has while theirs will but with before above don our it again him which if did from for what my up down further in where be against for out the against but herself whom in should below to then there can too as her with are whom ours your just am up more is than or him until them my now between below not have too to am that nor his theirs or now was some it under on out theirs with the such into until our before during this other who again who in same me but once whom him am has how between should they being under not same how himself this for having if both has t very but its were this are because am too then whom can itself but most myself more then me my why so no herself of not here off does that other very your having s and each not been don whom for if you does he below how under after do my yours only on no if themselves above up or while who its their that about out or why had ours only very who under herself through those yourself each there they as be there his into his under not when myself she my being in theirs did ours how yourself me too over such yours their other other most because nor each this than very me should having such herself do now themselves or have what herself because above don under during such under before during after yours have just against these about over to such too itself you did i do itself that doing same there themselves themselves above no i then himself your we when been that any where his who should t their me but until up theirs few between both you this yourself hers had am as yours that i this so its a about just at when so their him such will down herself until some more them does has will then she himself its at once just were same ourselves once not can not hers after can theirs but its at with again from has here for your nor very its their doing if to further these further yourselves a for should here which we after what ourselves down me yours on whom herself here is here was both can yourself i when did so same up s but can
