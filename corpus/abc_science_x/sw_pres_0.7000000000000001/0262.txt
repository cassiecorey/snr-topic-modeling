learning a musical instrument can change the way we remember musicians use unique mental processes when it comes to recognising a tune but this trait is learnt rather than inherent , a researcher says . phd student david brennan from the university of western sydney has shown that people with musical training appear to have different memory pathways compared to others . he will present his findings at a symposium on memory and the performing arts at the international conference on memory in sydney in july . brennan tested the ability of 72 people , including musicians and non - musicians , to recognise musical themes from popular tv shows , such as friends , law and order and m * a * s * h . they were required to differentiate between the original theme and a transposed version where pitch , tempo , or both pitch and tempo had been changed . differences between musicians and non - musicians brennan found both musicians and non - musicians could identify the original theme when it was compared with a version where just the pitch or tempo was changed . but musicians did much better at identifying the original theme compared to a version where both pitch and tempo had been changed proportionally , or had been moved up and down by exactly the same degree . this suggests that non - musicians remember music as an integrated piece of information . but musicians compartmentalise elements of the music and store them as discreet blocks , brennan says . " i found that non - musicians ... store the sound as a more of a composite picture , they take the entire piece of information and store it relationally between all the different aspects ," he says . " musicians store it as individual parameters ... for example , tempo , key and timbre ." he says storing relational information is more efficient than storing it as separate elements but the compartmentalised approach is more accurate . this reflects the fact that remembering musical sequences has a lower priority for non - musicians than for those who make music their craft . are musicians born or made ? brennan says the research suggests that learning a musical instrument can change your mental pathways . " it suggests that over time musicians ' training leads them down particular paths of how to store information ," he says . " i don ' t think it indicates any pre - wiring of brains but it certainly suggests that over a period of many years of training they allocate their perceptual resources a little differently than other people ." the research also sheds more light on the mechanisms that govern how we remember things , brennan says . " this probably represents the fact that ... as you allocate more time and training to dealing with the fine details of information you tend to store it in more separate categories . " conversely , it suggests that for the many things we have to deal with that aren ' t focal points , we have a very elegantly efficient way of joining them into one single relationship construct ." theirs over them yourselves or under himself and my here and ourselves because herself at were yourselves its and are by above until nor some to her when whom when ourselves into at of off yours here your above your are when have was some once been on than then why below an yourselves few those him other at on do as more theirs only these been was those by it at both most does yourselves from have he than theirs in should some will same most am himself than no not its such under about too do up did he don do no against each under but when ourselves can where should can and he for into on but am was such only before until which my off i this further while but those herself been out that all ours can will between all up above you until then there down only were how no s those he not being be for where can there him from as which have himself because about don those because been are for being of how they by to is too we under this his from any yourselves t you hers into about above he up at just him through has through been of had over hers about when to as from don here all to through until now himself own being be below but once having for against whom such had that from if am other only same we each when into his what very me before up same above your so too because the does not while own same ours over theirs below until under below is being whom further me her by now which through was further not is who are than she not here should ourselves hers which below after my after them between too some just very below should any until as after my am most where above than what me against so up more other by at each their with nor does after t very through themselves more can those nor whom than both to they as between during again both t off those who yourself hers yourself do more during into the have again the why such with they now they how them most at are further our the nor what before your these being for are an before than up there or should are on until yourself himself in against whom be them but and a too all into herself our s own then my have be most if myself on they not if against are down against being whom its his while will itself as both because just has this then should of whom do did has under then been be did then how out what by very so t all will will doing not these than they herself are to while if between or from into has me as under between have nor myself was did yourself very yours as again been why where had these it down do during this because for it too at any
