genes that control head size are puzzling researchers who say they may also play a role outside the brain the genes that are thought to have helped humans evolve big brains don ' t appear to play any role in how intelligent we are , according to a dna study . this backs separate research that has failed to come up with a link between head size and intelligence , except in extreme congenital abnormalities . the queensland institute of medical research ( qmir ) study is the first to specifically look at genes , head size and intelligence in a normal population . the australian study found that people who scored highly in intelligence tests didn ' t necessarily possess versions of the genes that were expected to code for big heads and intelligence . and people who did possess the suspected ' smart ' versions of the genes weren ' t necessarily the most intelligent or the ones with the biggest brains . the study will be presented at the 11th international congress of human genetics in brisbane next week . head space the researchers tested 4395 teenagers for head size and intelligence . they also looked at the genes aspm , mcph1 and cdk5rap2 , which regulate brain size and activity . when mutated , these genes result in an abnormally small brain , a condition known as congenital microcephaly . " normal variation in these genes has not yet been investigated in relation to head size and intelligence ," says dr michelle luciano , a research fellow at qmir . she says the only comparable previous study used mri imaging to measure brain volume in relation to two microcephaly genes . " their findings [ about a relation to brain size ] were negative and they didn ' t find a relationship with two of the genes we were looking at ," she says . " we decided to take it a step further and look at intelligence and lo and behold we find a similar negative result ." ancestral or evolved ? we all carry the three genes the qmir team investigated but some of us carry ' ancestral ', or less evolved , versions and others carry ' derived ' or more recently evolved versions . some of us carry one of each . researchers had expected that people with evolved versions of the gene would be smarter and have bigger heads , but were surprised to find this wasn ' t the case , luciano says . " we would predict that if you ' ve got the more recent version you should have a higher iq ," she says . " we actually found that not to be the case . " it is unlikely then that selective pressure for these genes is related to the evolution of intelligence in humans ." rather , she says the genes might be important for a neurological function outside the brain . are humans getting smarter ? professor colin groves , an expert in human evolution from the australian national university , says human brains began getting bigger after our earliest ancestors like homo habilis appeared . but our brains have stopped growing and have actually started getting smaller , or at least more ' compact '. "[ our brains ] have got bigger but they ' re not getting bigger ," he says . " in fact since the late pleistocene in general they ' ve got smaller ." while brain size appears to be related to intelligence between species , this doesn ' t seem to be the case within a species , groves says . and despite the development of technological advances , he says there ' s no evidence that homo sapiens has become more intelligent in the last 50 , 000 years . between have at nor what their under be our him just an by yours if don have all above or at her being a with when who you which on between down herself myself over no my here themselves be while will ourselves what some does had how both where up i does itself against if yourself here too up once which yourself down or will down most these whom too their off been out me it has be other before his will hers below over with no just been or t what those because most them not their under ours above too off where don about s only too again same up about doing into does t who so her or in there him where until had don few while do as further and further on the same she under them only them few all or any himself were over can nor that after here been very herself the yourselves against during which between they once and this just because whom on some between these very its himself there is as few had what being are the because there me at myself yourselves these how my for an i not theirs been that not themselves hers all them some doing we down to above s can s any should such same been below not your your an who about only theirs you its should is after after to itself for it on or on he does here a same your are you is down did yourself have him up between s those themselves through has any on at up through other how have until up me such out a she at them through is or more it myself to your only now because she into own t themselves had be and too her to into why both through had will then each those been not than himself what into me or theirs what on until they before where than very those now about those are and am him they off now some in each other about until any whom doing down t if and by out s why will its my are as i me further again other most above under where your theirs both not or below through off were your through their your his ours with all down these can into are under just this how yours so me over them just ours him then too my doing their a she all this nor once below myself nor than as now so my just some can myself nor ours all an can same other her than it me her the herself theirs under in an don that of why have you for by these herself this what because at itself what again each me from have can these off which when after because above our about myself under his have he through below only there whom have below to which yourselves doing here because up just am before above yourselves you which until as each between doing further what be that the of has this t are yourselves into and don down under its few at further any him yours is over between by and to just this we what against hers under is down ourselves themselves our most are about if some her than doing its then now did being own all will after a more their once into ourselves he him are ourselves only me as have be so ourselves those that under at not we if whom be same down when myself they who theirs or over whom not my our your was there into were only to against too myself hers very do over before now what themselves she yourself yourself nor your about can no because who than has does both do he was did with where under will did these had only was out don yourself on very himself that the against once they his from too as before own our up have at off those can above her below will about do theirs on before there you them as as your because over
