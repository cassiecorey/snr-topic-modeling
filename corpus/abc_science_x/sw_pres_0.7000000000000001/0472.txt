the study relied on over 50 ice cores collected from a range of locations around antarctica a new study that shows antarctic snowfalls have changed little in 50 years , despite global warming , could be evidence that the worst is yet to come , says one of the authors . a study published today in the journal science reports that , contrary to expectations , snowfall in antarctica has not increased over the past 50 years . this contradicts the predictions of most climate models that are based on the assumption that warming air can carry more moisture and produce greater snowfalls at the poles . " the models predict that antarctic snowfall should be increasing with a warming atmosphere ," says australian team member and palaeoclimatologist dr ian goodwin , of the university of newcastle . goodwin doesn ' t challenge this basic climate physics . but says the recent evidence supports the idea , not recognised in climate models , that there is a lag between global warming and antarctica ' s response to it . the reason is that antarctica and the southern hemisphere are surrounded by large oceans that take a long time to heat and therefore act as a buffer to climate change . recent evidence suggests the lag time could be up to 60 years , says goodwin . " we can be relatively complacent about the effects of climate change in the southern hemisphere because we haven ' t seen dramatic changes ," he says . " but the frightening thing i think is that we are not yet seeing the full impact of global warming in the southern hemisphere . but it ' s just around the corner ." natural cycles goodwin and colleagues published a study in 1991 that showed an increase in snowfall in east antarctica . but , the new study shows that since then , the amount of snow falling in that area has decreased . goodwin and colleagues used direct measurement of snowfall and more than 50 ice cores to reconstruct annual snowfall over the past 50 years . he says the study demonstrates a previously unknown natural climate cycle , affecting the whole of antarctica . " on one side of antarctica in some decades we see an increase in accumulation [ of snow ] and on the other side of antarctica we see a decrease and so it balances out to zero net gain ," he says . goodwin says this variability is so great it could mask any changes due to global warming . but , he says , it could only be a matter of time before the natural cycle becomes dwarfed by the changes brought about by global warming . and this is where he says the lag time becomes important . " if we were to rewrite this paper in say 10 years time the likelihood is that we will be actually be writing a paper that says ' significant change in antarctic snowfall over the last 10 to 15 years '," says goodwin . " in all likelihood we ' re about to see , in the next couple of decades , a very large response to global warming in antarctic and southern ocean regions ." goodwin says that the new research should now feed into climate models and make them more accurate . all during had below and a she its those having be doing before which had hers he after other does these other hers a until this your before himself what too under same now were why off hers ours me where to was on why we during have ourselves their not themselves below yourselves ourselves both herself had am only during and theirs at below until that themselves off too such by own your when have from that below over against own i these why into not itself not their will more own my while itself you on that further been once its until at they i yours theirs by theirs ours of this are any by before it does under myself where by just to does being themselves few those who yours for for and then above down through just when up both any herself because our or herself all when it his theirs now ours themselves by that in its same such myself his of for our then of now to if on was until on him further a most yourselves are about theirs only does about himself yourselves over myself ours were more had he were you what both only as their were my this all below over why they not above am ourselves a how our same such no themselves same of what any during do not from of are by has under the can other nor down that those yourselves any against what you doing whom having in other their them or but out for these against such an under there hers during few some from our further we these under about with off again how out through been was their her theirs herself under or above hers has in off before do just but below any being not too had further here not where during them s themselves doing if should these s own our your are between are over having s has you same most they off too too why on than am was a so before is doing them they has any what that ours or its same again its above where same themselves then s them same her here but each while further was other should s after as than these theirs hers these on while will hers do just most a does my herself off themselves where how myself itself our once at no until having until again she what if doing hers than just herself has yours at your not through yourself same a what t when doing why as yourselves he not having such any be here s their t are who you which yourself some during his or out just her whom down he of on than here in were through should having ourselves for her most again am does very being from into that does him before or we am all who am at an here some was not as am too himself an how all than by its yourselves her so have yours have than if again after herself doing themselves some them a do too for she both own not ours under during those more yourselves hers it it if or about all yourselves but did yourselves their so your nor into ours did under between my other you
