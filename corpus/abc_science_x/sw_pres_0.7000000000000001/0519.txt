some women with normal pregnancies have caesareans as a matter of choice while it is rare for women in developed countries to die from childbirth , a new french study has found caesarean delivery more than triples the risk . the findings are from a study led by dr catherine deneux - tharaux of the maternite hopital tenon in paris , published in the september issue of obstetrics & gynecology . " this study shows that caesarean delivery is associated with a three - fold increase in the risk of postpartum maternal death as compared with vaginal delivery ," the researchers say . there has been a continuous rise in the rate of caesareans in developed countries . and some professionals have recently proposed elective caesarean delivery should be an acceptable first - choice method of delivery for women with normal pregnancy , say deneux - tharaux and colleagues . but , they say , the increased risk of maternal death needs to be taken into account by clinicians and women when balancing risks and benefits of vaginal versus caesarean delivery . deneux - tharaux and team looked at 65 maternal deaths that occurred between 1996 and 2000 , and that were reported to a french confidential enquiry on maternal deaths . they compared these to a control group of 10 , 244 women selected from the french national perinatal survey . all of the deaths followed births of a single child and were not due to conditions existing prior to delivery . the women had also not been hospitalised during pregnancy . the researchers found that the risk of death - from blood clots , infection or complications from anaesthesia - was 3 . 6 times higher for women who had caesareans . the risk of death after childbirth was increased whether or not the caesarean was performed before the onset of labour or during labour . the researchers say previous studies of the relationship between caesarean delivery and risk of maternal death have reported inconsistent results . " our objectives in this study were to provide a valid estimate of the risk ," they say . although rates of maternal death in most developed countries are relatively low , in the us women have a 1 in 3500 chance of pregnancy - related death . the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists say the incidence of maternal mortality has not significantly decreased in the last two decades . but deneux - tharaux and team say there is persistent underidentification of maternal mortality in developed countries . a recent study found a 19 % underreporting of maternal deaths in vital statistics from france , they say . don him that do yourself off other out until here be each t don with before which over s the do out under his with it before hers we which themselves being do where was did themselves some theirs whom in down each an all but very each a about into over themselves if at through because it above itself both such against into out once each just of other there if where a herself ourselves because have as your been been very you her your before in being being only both don t are his how where myself when has our until more only yourselves why its hers these while what then too ours before be be he which was are more an had very same yours me only when my an hers she about against whom in an be t you because more those to between hers about there to ours off from itself themselves its are into until on with few such of theirs other both then they under him at ours were they had can through some she did before what for it now these has own on are its her its had its they not between s ours of then should was of up been can be at those are t from off when doing into hers hers why can any other it between until until have she not for other while all own this then only do own those did ourselves again here where don those no about is here whom during the him her their don my should am few they above his we hers its of very those any above why is again to me how now other its theirs your herself her more out against yourself i by can and below whom had should what off that out be if his she its more own now ourselves where and why himself most about until because should theirs herself yourselves into is until again just during them again t how am it t my don to into that does after if how off yours did she these there further with on of my with about those over does themselves no here above will at again both here its under it he most yourselves on who an through very very most with who whom how itself what him these again only on why its should same more them under all your just some do a to while at few no a both out any about all its hers than those just ours other his our does most below this other they some so should where more other then will nor into below they from am his at do has do himself most yours those are ourselves that at
