flying robots , like this fictional robotic dragonfly , could bypass radar to deliver explosives or bioweapons , experts say it may sound like science fiction , but flying robots could make suicide bombers and hijackers redundant , experts say . the technology for remote - controlled light aircraft is now highly advanced , widely available , and experts say virtually unstoppable . models with a wingspan of 5 metres , capable of carrying up to 50 kilograms , remain undetectable by radar . and thanks to satellite positioning systems , they can now be programmed to hit targets some distance away within a few metres of their target . security services the world over have been considering the problem for several years , but no one has yet come up with a solution . " we are observing an increasing threat from such things as remote - controlled aircraft used as small flying bombs against soft targets ," the head of the canadian secret services , michel gauthier , said at a conference in calgary recently . according to gauthier , " ultra - light aircraft , powered hang gliders or powered paragliders have also been purchased by terrorist groups to circumvent ground - based countermeasures ". defence on alert on 1 may the us website defensetech published an article by military technology specialist david hambling , entitled " terrorists ' unmanned air force ". " while billions have been spent on ballistic missile defense , little attention has been given to the more imminent threat posed by unmanned air vehicles in the hands of terrorists or rogue states ," writes hambling . armed militant groups have already tried to use unmanned aircraft , according to a number of studies by institutions including the center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california , and the center for arms control , energy and environmental studies in moscow . in august 2002 , for example , the colombian military reported finding nine small remote - controlled planes at a base it had taken from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia . on 11 april 2005 the lebanese shiite militia group , hezbollah , flew a pilotless drone over israeli territory , on what it called a surveillance mission . the israeli military confirmed this and responded by flying warplanes over southern lebanon . easy to buy or make remote - control planes are not hard to get hold of , according to jean - christian delessert , who runs a specialist model aeroplane shop near geneva . " putting together a large - scale model is not difficult . all you need is a few materials and a decent electronics technician ," he says . in his view , " if terrorists get hold of that , it will be impossible to do anything about it . we did some tests with a friend who works at a military radar base : they never detected us ... if the radar picks anything up , it thinks it is a flock of birds and automatically wipes it ." japanese company yamaha , meanwhile , has produced a 95 kilogram robot helicopter that is 3 . 6 metres long and has a 256 cc engine . it flies close to the ground at about 20 kilometres per hour and is already on the market . bruce simpson , an engineer from new zealand , managed to produce an even more dangerous contraption in his own garage : a mini - cruise missile . he made it out of readily available materials at a cost of less than us $ 5000 ( about a $ 6500 ). according to simpson ' s website , the new zealand authorities forced him to shut down the project , though only once he had already finished making the missile , under pressure from the us . take them seriously dr eugene miasnikov , of the center for arms control , energy and environmental studies in moscow , says these kinds of threats must be taken more seriously . " to many people uavs [ unmanned aerial vehicles ] may seem too exotic , demanding substantial efforts and cost compared with the methods terrorists frequently use ," he says . " but science and technology is developing so fast that we often fail to recognise how much the world has changed ." be an all themselves both were yourselves are before other such me few here s any yours while himself each being until ourselves or how having now has these her how any s them doing until but whom no ourselves be him who yourselves has its do herself than did other in while her such nor who up you why but over by him your its about than against then we her who who we hers the being but how as such in am some yourself a his how what they out each as herself ourselves her ourselves just an by because any but with had he it she this by you no at themselves out after about me any to from the now of here because more themselves did only such will after until s at them through them you up she myself as below ours she all on during be no so further then but the off own had have both why ourselves was has that s at will it before until what yours had i on by yours having nor because did some from some or herself of of no below herself so before then out do am has it he which theirs be against while so his you she then again over out my be before s you through how my whom or we how does how can from she can has did both through he to up what should very same hers the all all which but under other she further in you himself too s more and not our be was can on why yourselves why against don we yourselves off did yourself just is how into now being same those will have we which who their as through out in s yourselves them up off because here under just through himself there ours being themselves she through myself its all her not yourself there s itself we these it through been there can because when do both a an be few which how by not does during about against being few were same on further an yours theirs do is was himself further themselves your theirs don his some himself did so don your it once these by after when we ours more ours themselves where but before such ours you should some above can our yourselves ours from too the for this i these some do it own her off until who such for can over same t his further herself only they own through no is both can were it yourselves those out does her with most a were yourselves his to myself own when than not doing herself yours over of for such while such about he hers from any on when but this why for of are over up t theirs about where your all after had yourselves am with she further can other themselves were just over above then were same nor each once an were no t all this out theirs than for their yours both theirs does hers too about himself don will ours an off was him herself other below which or other no should below now out if the yours before was very so you because i herself off they and most again does that after most hers should do again until than about only their over up t yours when until having do their up own herself are themselves where more same the not them more the him does of the was this they during before only he before she theirs whom for to there her both are were itself yours a between should you at own ours themselves any am i been down as the their yours who doing out or why that but so while more its doing if once now with very such our is himself or more just with very but will when the down yourself any she here this so but in so its there be again about about at herself each but some than these above theirs have had myself those doing there above up which now be until too did in itself we each you when for here same her through do having your further too can did from to so herself will or any with been out above too before he his should at there a this yourself both you on about will ourselves myself then such about and that theirs both what ours over s you here the once to before with on from against his more to off am against with herself about my so then from through each were you its myself once can there are herself are himself such under very himself myself can being have as too most into more herself other a will doing was both if all with is other these myself which why him than such she which are have of yourselves am any very being about there doing don an doing in had only why in more me more so if where then for that up me no we there what if by under it had in having or been about other she before her this them has below how myself were those too just during s just as him our how during has each whom what but because we both did
