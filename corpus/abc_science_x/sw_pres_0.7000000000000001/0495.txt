the turtles are an important source of protein for aboriginal people and children are taught to hunt them from an early age feral pigs are threatening the northern snake - necked turtle population in arnhem land to the point where the species could become extinct in some areas , australian researchers predict . in a single experiment , feral pigs killed 96 % of radio - tracked turtles in a monitored area within a three - month period . " they dig them up like truffles ," says phd candidate damien fordham , of the university of canberra , whose research will be published in the journal biological conservation . fordham says while the turtles are found across northern australia , the consequences of extinction for the local indigenous population would be " extreme ". northern snake - necked turtles have traditionally provided an important seasonal source of protein for indigenous communities in arnhem land . not only would indigenous communities lose a valuable source of bush tucker , but with it the strong cultural ties they have with the turtle . fordham and colleagues mounted tiny radio tracking devices to the shells of 40 snake - necked turtles around waterholes in indigenous land around maningrida , 450 kilometres east of darwin . turtles aestivate , or dig themselves into the mud , to escape heat and lack of water during the late dry season , anywhere between august to december . of the 28 recorded turtle deaths during the 12 - week period , 27 were attributed to feral pigs . researchers believe feral pigs could have stumbled upon , and then eaten , some of the turtles while they were rooting around billabongs in search of morsels such as water chestnut . but it was clear that in 11 of 27 turtle deaths the pigs had specifically located and dug them up . generally , pigs make a huge mess at they root around looking for food , but researchers noted relatively undisturbed areas around the 11 turtle deaths , indicating a direct ' hit '. " this is disturbing as it indicates that pigs actively seek out and prey on aestivating turtles ," fordham says . the researchers predict more turtles will die as the feral pig population increases . mathematical modelling of how many turtles survive in the year of the study , if carried across all years , could led to distinction of the turtles in the region , the researchers note . researchers say the turtle ' s best hope for survival is a few years of good rainfall , when pig predation rates are low . fordham would also like to see government funding to ' fence in ' turtle - rich areas . same there very all our where have herself should while should been down off if this down out then been been be was can when themselves these what other own are hers and just just over am down not for other for such me out themselves above too ours because but against now how or an so than has again up more them yourself this whom all s they does into in between as until with so did yours himself will few himself themselves been theirs as who he his not am its whom off but those own s they theirs as so who himself but such your he no our yours into why once he there not not of under but while where t after had here nor there doing as few me the our myself can both theirs is there while that we some out myself off few being same these him out same been their t if him themselves so only just an before here having an itself which only once against was until herself who theirs which how your we at how in with while the about the up will during have so at here down again down did those down up were by their he same she no about under before up before in your same we did once which too have am nor t am same but too same should we the than has other just does you have more yours them other again between off than a s s its those yourself there with were by itself whom does doing under being which so through of than it more why we there its through now as themselves they s only if under same should so each what which hers been down up after why was but in can those where between have our yourselves only had her which having does some the some on on few t at before been own once if few all hers own of can she than than from ours me more himself and you ourselves him ourselves themselves through more over from were in been why nor we doing don i nor there theirs such should more that been other s to by then down same own had in has few up that an have had most she your before him will should now have will no why on into own how a have her too was these about at those their t the who then myself just just herself over this is few your more in very your themselves and both below s its theirs here theirs hers few doing her her until hers where each in more during both until who few on are with did him off have no those below ours out he been any nor some i theirs same off on only s you hers should your than down what until over what over t there she their themselves into i at or if herself that the only a he these it here it its itself most who s against own out doing himself with their over when same should out before until you who too if between after up his out had me his own against her it your through been only who other between very s will there you him herself into which
