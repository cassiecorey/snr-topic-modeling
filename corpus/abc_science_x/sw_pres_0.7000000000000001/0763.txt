researchers have found dna associated with nanoparticles from kidney stones . could these strange particles be nanobacteria ? researchers who ' ve found strange nanoparticles in a handful of kidney stones say these self - replicating specks may play a role in disease . the us researchers are not sure whether these tiny particles , 50 to 100 nanometres across , are living nanobacteria or just some strange non - living self - assembling ball of chemicals . " we have some evidence that would support either possibility ," says kidney specialist dr john lieske of the mayo clinic college of medicine . he and colleagues report their findings in the december issue of the journal of investigative medicine . at some point in their life about 10 % of people will get kidney stones , a painful condition in which calcium deposits clog the kidneys . scientists aren ' t sure what causes these deposits . but one theory that lieske and colleagues are investigating is that tiny calcium - covered particles are partly to blame . previous research has found such particles in human serum , urine , renal cysts from patients with kidney disease , as well as in kidney stones . lieske says some researchers dub the particles nanobacteria , and propose they are a new disease - causing agent . but lieske says there is not yet enough evidence these particles are alive . nanoparticle investigation lieske ' s team isolated the nanoparticles , which have a protein - lipid core surrounded by a calcium phosphate shell , from kidney stones . the researchers grew the nanoparticles in culture over a period of four to eight weeks . they found that antibiotics and metabolic inhibitors slowed the particles ' growth . then the researchers grew a large batch of nanoparticles , dissolved the calcium shells and extracted proteins and dna . does all this mean that the nanoparticles are nanobacteria after all ? lieske says it ' s still too early to say . " there definitely is dna associated with [ the nanoparticles ]," he says . " but is that a contaminant ?" he says some fragments of the protein and dna appear to match known bacteria . his team now plans to grow more nanoparticles and see if they can find a unique genetic signature that would prove the nanoparticles are indeed nanobacteria . scepticism geologists and astrobiologists have also considered the possibility of nanobacteria over the years . for instance , understanding the full range of life forms is important in our search for extraterrestrial life . professor malcolm walter of the australian centre for astrobiology in sydney , says there has been much scepticism about nanobacteria . has too will at yourselves now to out and out over in by does just why whom itself how on during s themselves are too now while his an too do about is whom so when your had i through own no some had to should hers does me where further before will will where here should who once at she those against by whom until between into to but about above not them some what itself only nor between don the that themselves about she yourself whom against ours are both ourselves then under about no where your than which or you when will other they it the about he yours with same same am only other how your themselves from by such himself until itself from theirs to did further himself same who just these in few same out do because being did by this your himself again being they should further down hers which by t yours itself will how be through under its we such own ours own theirs herself whom most me few than can from other whom nor herself him further off were against at did should once an how down no your than off me other it more and while yourself during does my then such of after until am who no as doing with into whom into had has them that i an through each off did she his now don most once i on as both some above an his no after then there between an her her then whom into itself about again on all just she about during theirs hers we that now when during were nor before under very be an so while himself between itself a up which they my how the or i have who has yours an up into their your me few too most being yourselves will hers all both nor have those when or by did most don each but an ourselves of you after further are but while don had over by off have during it under of against was my other have most about was it off am why same for both there hers all he further our hers what a no here as nor only so its before further by his but so by i to s some most if what few their themselves both so and most is her over than more whom on before this off i his just who myself this does where most down an your same i how have just each while while am up on her she again while because than own not how off our after then where have which further did through above our there our yourselves both which them between he but whom these here hers its from them why until such am once been they this ourselves before up their again being having and or my most both can them did being when he can are was then have i this our other into other more few her up until themselves yourself ourselves from our out
