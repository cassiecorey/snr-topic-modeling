are you looking at me ? more australian racehorses have vision - threatening eye disease than expected , a new study shows . about one in 13 thoroughbred horses examined may be in danger of losing their sight . cataracts , corneal scarring and lesions are among the serious conditions that two veterinarians report in the latest issue of the journal veterinary ophthalmology . dr simon hurn and colleague dr andrew turner say there is a perception in the racing industry that eye disease in horses is not very common . but they had noticed a higher than acceptable level of eye disease in performance horses and were concerned . when they couldn ' t find data to compare what they had found , they decided to carry out their own research . they conducted ophthalmic examinations on 204 flat - racing and jump - racing horses at four metropolitan and two country racing stable complexes in victoria . they found potential vision - threatening eye disease in 7 . 4 % of the horses and non - vision threatening disease in 57 . 4 %. generally horses ' eyesight is on par with that of humans , the researchers say . " they probably don ' t have the same colour spectral type vision that we have but they do see colour and they do see movement . and because they move at speed , we can also assume they have good visual acuity [ sharpness ] as well ," says hurn . he adds that many of the eye findings were ' incidental ' and wouldn ' t affect horses ' vision . " horses don ' t have to read newspapers or drive cars . most of their time is spent eating or watching out for what they think are predators ," he says . " they can do that just fine with that vision that they have and the reason they don ' t have the same type of colour vision that we have is that they just don ' t need it . their eyesight is [ good ] for their environment ." hurn says while there may well be a genetic component to the eye diseases in general , he also believes vets are getting better at diagnosing eye disease . " we noticed a higher than normal incidence of cataracts in the population of horses , [ however ] and this could certainly have a genetic component ," he says . will all on each should from where had after had itself is when these her he them is i t will than what too your before by they too t she to down but or where am don my between over from under s with there between her himself other their again his yours this over did my have such of them you having more how into when down myself an between some before between again his be is yours not were is why was out why against at be themselves was both himself t it whom too once nor against them after theirs during when who why her it am yours against me other after by a not we i few i through was who each here t him further herself no his which its were had by against but why that have more yourself both ourselves under your down while herself hers between a our he me about no our only they ourselves between where as be from myself or which when having can her whom your and own because was under has on under own who themselves of nor as off hers with hers off some against down such both up or very as because do can them were yourselves been what their whom while my while it about did over what who how those theirs through than did ourselves be an some can being all all have themselves into my do other she them these ours out with s while you those now my under having then himself these t been being are why doing only themselves should other down were there the don my the more this above at if until did i all ours why a which you be no his off this by over he her now hers is they or above very t from i both ours now than because we your between his until for your not my his under both all some be this few own my then before or off by at itself from he having but both only don them my myself or what himself each be s not does was until hers until both of what should only more once at himself up or hers ourselves at did as no are ours when until under because should into of on up before
