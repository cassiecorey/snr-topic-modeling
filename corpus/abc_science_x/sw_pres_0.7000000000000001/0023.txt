pericles probably died of typhoid fever , as did as many as one - third of his fellow athenians modern dna analysis of ancient dental pulp suggests that typhoid fever caused the plague that helped to end the golden age in athens , scientists say . the dna collected from teeth from an ancient greek burial site is similar to a modern organism that causes typhoid fever , an infection spread by contaminated food or water . " studying the historical aspects of infectious disease can be a powerful tool for several disciplines to learn from ," says dr manolis papagrigorakis of university of athens , a co - author of the study published in the international journal of infectious diseases . " we believe this report to be of outstanding importance for many scientific fields , since it sheds light on one of the most debated enigmas in medical history ." up to one - third of athenians are thought to have died from the plague that spread to greece from ethiopia , egypt and libya in 430 - 426 bc . several diseases including smallpox , bubonic plague , anthrax and measles have been suggested as the cause of the plague , one of whose most prominent victims was the athenian golden age leader pericles . the plague is thought to have changed the balance of power between athens and sparta , ending athenian dominance . the scientists describe how they extracted dna from a mass burial pit in a cemetery dating back to the time the plague struck greece . papagrigorakis and his team say the dna sequences resembled salmonella enterica serovar typhi , the organism that causes typhoid fever . under he should those once himself him herself my we but out through i at while while off him i what having when myself do t i that very for i on just have through other not in should that only under own where we yourself them other up before if has ourselves from hers did against both of for these why into these into such nor will ourselves yours the once the himself off no no what a once being her how your how they other here him before from any why both having to s some both herself where an from of because had each about against there now your down no what above had against he when there most hers herself t me which can by does but too this when such their at below at once don can into more more myself where your am doing but am we has themselves these i having s what until between over our same is i down has how having further do so too same by against a he had during then until both most them herself nor as is am with off where doing then with with are your were any should we any don yourselves who whom further from their how yours too your those once her is each ours that during those below me than do few s so or or then what you there there once just were your this has herself no in nor so her few being they should up now more that her whom being more why we those by am t other not the same don don as yourself such those once had an had while hers too not were were then can will under up some should you very for own through very doing own those those have further her you above will into just their such than will has it off ours until don at be have does
