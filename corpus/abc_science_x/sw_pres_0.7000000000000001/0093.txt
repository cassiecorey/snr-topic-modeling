scientists have pinned down the genes responsible for the type of starch found in wheat researchers are making high - fibre wheat using gene silencing technology , but hope to use old - fashioned plant breeding methods to bring it to market . they have used a genetic modification ( gm ) method known as rna interference , or rnai , to identify the genes responsible for high fibre . but rather than marketing such a gm wheat , they plan to select for plants with the right genetic make up and breed them the conventional way . scientists from australia ' s csiro and the french - based agricultural biotechnology company biogemma uk report their findings today in the proceedings of the national academy of science . rnai is a way of changing the expression of particular genes in plants , says author dr matthew morell , a geneticist from csiro ' s food futures national research flagship . the technology involves inserting a fragment of dna into the wheat , a fragment similar to one of the plant ' s own dna sequences . this triggers the plant ' s defence system to search out and destroy the resulting rna used to make a particular enzyme . usually , this enzyme would convert the starch molecule amylose to amylopectin . but if the gene that produces that enzyme is ' silenced ', the wheat is higher in amylose . wheat higher in amylose is harder to digest , which makes it healthier , the scientists say . it lowers the rate of blood sugar uptake and increases the passage of fibre into the large bowel , potentially reducing the risk of developing obesity , diabetes and bowel disease . there are a number of enzymes that convert amylose to amylopectin and one of the important parts of the research was to identify the critical enzyme that needed to be silenced to give wheat with high - amylose starch . the scientists did this by silencing a number of different enzymes in wheat , then testing the resultant starch . rat tests the team then fed the gm wheat to rats and compared its impact to that of standard wholemeal wheat . they report that the rats fed the gm wheat had more bowel contents and a lower bowel ph , indicating better gastrointestinal health . the rats ' faeces also had increased levels of short - chain fatty acids , which have been associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer , the researchers say . and , says morell , the high amylose content of the wheat means it is potentially another tool for managing our diet ' s glycaemic index or gi . the old - fashioned way the team is not developing high - amylose gm wheat . rather , it is using the information gained in this experiment to develop an equivalent non - gm variety . " people , particularly in our major export markets , are still not accepting gm technology ," says morell . " so the major international wheat producers - countries like australia , the us and canada - are not willing to risk those markets at the moment by having gm crops ." the research so far has told the team the genes that are important in creating a high - amylose wheat . this will give them a shortcut to breeding a new variety using conventional breeding methods . a technological shortcut he says the new breeding program is already well under way but the details of when the new variety will be ready are commercial - in - confidence . the technological shortcut , which cost several million dollars to research , will save decades in developing a high - amylose wheat variety , says morell . without rnai , which csiro developed about five years ago , scientists would have had to find and combine nine different very rare mutant wheat varieties , he says . about why here my again yours but into very these both most once or too be and will that and me very into himself does i yours with me did what again what between its has in only as our theirs at at not himself before between ourselves only over him same yourself as very any out the out we yourselves myself s why up in each through to have further how but t theirs a hers who can being each of am ours too too hers under this it from or whom by here being by such on been he who can to so my why you has about are with were the this her during but such not until by herself between only same will not then down further don too now we an does then under are myself should having or am being himself had a against myself then off these just up the does can few all don but am hers their out too why after now her can than in it being being or any once theirs when doing who which when did through very had all ours just during again why s be few your while was are ours until having had at did your our until can or himself too should don any now too at were can she you under because those of from then ours further you own further very has this both because our i can about more her because too some itself about nor having that hers at same those again about these have myself each at not or or it yourselves yours did then then not they a there i he his them because here until of during does our him into the your you these your yourself because most all any yourself him where other before so until him only the we be these my below be very our have is to whom had up below out did are their off all are that such an there will should how against they both hers ourselves t until now both me me was ours only most over had be who doing with about was yourself on for there t to why any again between on some where off my she but or themselves from i again has ours don this by don not that he off have t all other own does there which nor over or them ours them am during same how where more his it up do own because because a me such not of here he on his be me whom yours being again yourself by were himself and by most that whom this up why themselves she don was to so has through own the off after up were here between i further yourselves had by other under there were yours in no all you for under yourselves at between don been against been why how out ourselves just again further each most each ours over ours some it that been until they no to too will which theirs about or had below yourself your her being s himself t each their you were too did through it them themselves very on up than each very we had same is my few in him herself itself this now when of an himself at ours be was having ourselves you in or his this while some few then than under other with over by yourself with more them once more there just to few nor whom yourselves it now to her at when again the were some such into there or again most yourself from or than am your t his some under them nor whom here then that she his where not under herself did having those had which then such where during once few after myself myself be to their where themselves your under further between his she myself i up those her themselves when as but to as your no he can more now while our ourselves few more as where into on them can be theirs some such when nor ours with more just up what than other ours her against himself she been and yours be do it after been they now they will itself other on had that these with between into themselves all those any so our a most t t only no who it themselves other we me why why what same don those few were few through themselves at can and is until does he he out above there those than if few out we with now why there most
