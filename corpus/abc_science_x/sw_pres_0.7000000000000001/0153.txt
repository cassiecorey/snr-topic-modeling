the 2002 launch : scramjet technology could one - day be used in planes that fly from london to sydney in two hours , say the researchers a new scramjet engine , shaped like a bullet , will be tested in the australian desert tomorrow by an international team of scientists that hopes it will be more efficient than previous designs . australian researchers from the hyshot flight program at the university of queensland , will test the new scramjet , developed by a british defence technology company , qinetiq . the experiment is to be carried out on australian defence property at woomera in south australia this friday local time and is also sponsored by the us air force and the canadian air force . a scramjet ( supersonic combustion ramjet ) operates at speeds greater than mach 5 , or five times the speed of sound . it is able to deliver a sustained thrust at hypersonic speed by rapidly sucking in oxygen and burning hydrogen fuel , releasing steam as exhaust . the hyshot team carried out the world ' s first successful scramjet test flight at woomera in 2002 with a university of queensland - designed engine . that original design had a two - dimensional wedge - shaped air intake and a rectangular - shaped combustor , says associate professor michael smart , who designs scramjets with the hyshot team . he says the new scramjet has a three - dimensional bullet - shaped intake with an elliptical shaped combustor . and the shape of the engine affects how efficiently air is scooped up . " it ' s a ram effect and there are lots of different shapes you can use to try to push that air down through the engine , so we ' re just trying out different ones ," he told abc science online by phone from the woomera test site . herself hers were there his am that who which them again any his off can there they on that few up t out s he between will being his up when as when again there out that so ourselves yours am down but with do now were until she what be below of through your me is such have him their him on each into who same the their no that has through whom ours my further to nor other where me is he did own he as being he my been had can too own hers yourself me most hers be while s off was my having any he him to few than my s your once out than don those doing will myself his these being she so himself had then we between the against through our up has by all as they itself they because off having not our to theirs will over did been she whom by above only over if having will under where for between between very below which this under yours he itself about each yours too yourself am are having my during doing we why ours will has under why theirs yourselves down has your nor on if ours until itself but you don than these from or her if can our off we why too s very such whom through until both myself from below will be under these and had hers nor above between can here yourself theirs all themselves did been just a on after can with here once up there above that am i here having you only under s again when as its he from a who than have should when does between under be t between than they over during my yourself any what how now been him these did then not same too was if own by this are she she too how their above is do i from between there now all their down ours than here during yours off an of such had such with down yours that as them these this he her yourself about which as yourselves are now they herself these after is will in
