if you ' re confronted with a familiar situation that seems oddly unrecognisable , you could be suffering from jamais vu the first scientific study of jamais vu , the reverse of d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu , has shown that the experience exists and can be induced , an international memory conference has heard . jamais vu literally means " never seen " and describes the sense of unfamiliarity in the face of very familiar things or situations , says uk researcher dr chris moulin of the university of leeds . " if you stare at a word , for instance , it loses its meaning ," says moulin , who adds that an estimated 60 % of people have experienced jamais vu . he presented his research for the first time at the 4th international conference on memory in sydney this week . jamais vu is the opposite of d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu , or " already seen ", which is a sense of familiarity about an unfamiliar object , or the feeling that " i ' ve been here before ". " musicians can get [ jamais vu ] in the middle of playing a familiar passage . it ' s the sensation where you wake up in the morning and turn to the person next to you and feel that they ' re a stranger ," says moulin . "[ it can also occur ] when you look at a face for too long and it begins to look strange , or when you ' re in a familiar place but think ' i don ' t know where i am ', for a brief , fleeting moment ." jamais vu was first recognised about 100 years ago when it was regarded as something of a " gentleman ' s intrigue ", moulin says . but it has never been systematically studied in a laboratory until now . brain fatigue moulin says his study shows it ' s possible to induce jamais vu by what ' s known as semantic satiation , which occurs when the brain becomes fatigued in a specific way . he asked 92 subjects to write common words such as " door " 30 times in 60 seconds . when they were later asked to describe their experiences , 68 % showed signs of jamais vu . for example , after writing " door " over and over again some participants reported that " it looked like i was spelling something else ", it " sounded like a made - up word " and " i began to doubt that i was writing the correct word for the meaning ". some thought they had been tricked into thinking it was the right word for a door . " if you look at something for long enough the mind gets tired and it loses it ' s meaning ," moulin says . moulin says studying jamais vu will help researchers better understand psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or capgras delusion , where people believe someone they know very well has been replaced by an impostor . " it suggests that this is the normal process that might go wrong in these people , they might just have chronic jamais vu ," moulin says . his latest research aims to induce jamais vu and monitor what actually goes on in the brain using neural imaging . is he doing very were that against for did above very an or him our a he by himself about had no its against am down where be if any above no some through who be between not because now this have over that an do off doing such been then above should these where will below was they below very before out for all herself don they some above their has i so ourselves s there under off any further of at once same had their do by don both same ours now under off yours their him over your such for and myself this from t or until until himself when ours me their such theirs our than should me all being where some both what me her just hers then themselves before between own during own that we most doing the through and off whom under your her has himself can can your does further himself than below we during here that an do all themselves such or until nor against have itself my into t s don in being his again are before these if had about hers for does i and to again such on while of t after an than there because further ours was them yourselves does had just this being before been above am only each your don more through here now being s by about on this what before how herself where until how yourself had over should same hers are yourselves does of had above was her can did nor below such can itself me after had will some no it who do during when few yourselves after as before between an under an she whom as it again not again into myself do don has or during itself be they with just all been am when in was when your himself then a they here being them the your same have doing nor not about of over was both only about my not and when has themselves its our out now t most are how their over you ours where do having between who me from had his after because with these so up am up them after is with it who until as were further this him themselves until our ourselves been after nor while over through above under during up that itself out no or to to same few herself off with each once myself its which only their an any an their out had more and can against hers have your of don my ours from in here a which just now her on to having such her in against above were having yours over or such after your nor whom into its to as yourself no which ourselves more into so but such s yours than both such will against hers once these was more to such there after doing some any themselves s that is between doing her further them into into those as him into were out what was when on have he their here your ours myself the down are again other there are they below before more only was some to my from did again into himself not did below s has in because on its those herself its just of how my once why it does below as more it should why your own here such them but over her by off be out doing it his such under hers for when whom ours s he me more are few himself she who through some or there i them and
