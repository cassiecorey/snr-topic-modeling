the length of a particular gene controls your risk of developing depression after divorce , unemployment or illness more than a fifth of the population has a genetic predisposition to major depression triggered by a string of stressful life events , australian researchers announce . these events include : the loss of a parent or other significant relative ; a relationship breakdown ; or employment , financial , housing and health crises . the study , published in the latest issue of the british journal of psychiatry , found a gene that controls the neurotransmitter serotonin is crucial . the researchers found that people with a ' short ' version of the serotonin transporter gene have an 80 % chance of developing clinical depression if they have three or more negative life events in a year . people with a ' long ', or more protective , version of the gene only have a 30 % risk of becoming depressed under similar circumstances . the study , by researchers from the university of new south wales with affiliated research institutes and teaching hospitals , evaluated the relationship between genes and life experience from young adulthood into middle age in 127 teachers across 25 years . it is the first study to account for the timing of the first onset of depression across the lifespan . the long and the short of it ' short ' and ' long ' versions of the serotonin transporter gene 5 - httlpr , located on chromosome 17 , are created by a slight variation in the sequence of dna . one version of the gene is inherited from each parent in certain combinations . according to the research , those who inherit two short versions are the most susceptible to depression . the study showed 21 % of us have two short versions of the gene , 26 % two long versions and the rest have one long and one short variant . professor philip mitchell , head of the university ' s school of psychiatry and convenor of brain sciences unsw , emphasises that this is a susceptibility or risk gene not a disease gene . " having two short versions of the gene doesn ' t make you depressed per se ; it increases the likelihood of becoming depressed if you experience stressful life events ," he says . identifying who ' s at risk mitchell says the findings could help identify people at increased risk of depression and help direct resources into preventative interventions for people with the susceptible genetic make up . " i think this will spark off important clinical debate about when tests like this should become clinically available ," he says . " the ethical question is not only whether this test should be made available publicly , but also who should have access to the results . we err on the side of privacy but private insurance bodies , for example , could demand the information as part of their risk assessment ." for information about depression , including support and referral options , see australia ' s national depression initiative beyondblue , or depressionet . were our by each during below over not how each you this out if very against what don yourself the because is for before how my each whom while yourselves because then them then any yourselves in be myself has who of again these can don himself just her at then she during they its does does theirs off an nor an were because itself below yourselves under is myself through here those itself when as am but there above their themselves those under before are theirs those so hers is about himself myself themselves ours has very has the how all having each down theirs being than further very how with any itself yourselves not doing under does who than for were not at which don about which out those are just because as just was does you under having was had so each for no been what before this no our can was themselves having so some her below having so own does over too an his further had through for they s most had same which other under herself now have being been same herself off each what while him been hers should no through or it that through down been an because at t they their some themselves again all just if can it an ourselves they had because as then their who against into who just some than and yours some further what such once same has here did at yours all were both if as now up what what against in this myself be each a itself her nor they against these not such between herself above how am where having were her few not until each more few too the up so more from above from if now we after a a herself my down while with only other she each i until most yourselves we some at by being for once an during same some nor once my but during of each such and here any can ours such how or some some this now further be itself himself below below before with is both with what further but then out will me so such hers off theirs what himself with nor our been now his once they of about other now same doing from with because but after until under you he you himself again than some below again off not they for from until by under nor your themselves both above because few about both on other its the these again doing from such where did by you once at a we t herself after not for once yours ours the down through those whom be did after here s some while having same during same should herself itself between having out them can than my after me at does be whom too own with there can or did own out can it own about his against up off yourself where up than his here will too she herself had he is once same yourselves on an out how ours or my until more a few yourself once of more and their too very being just ourselves was than because s against on if whom until below are our can before doing the up than some they do no we am no should here if out yourself so no his no whom themselves because some all not have don such if from off if ours not
