the fab tree hab weaves together branches to form living archways growing a home from living trees instead of building a home from felled timber is the goal of an architect from the massachusetts institute of technology . dr mitchell joachim , part of the mit media lab ' s smart cities group , along with ecological engineer dr lara greden and architect javier arbona , propose a home that is actually an ecosystem . the fab tree hab goes beyond sustainable housing and so - called green design , building with materials that have a low impact on the environment and human health . " not only does it do zero damage , but it will hopefully clean the air ," says joachim . the habitat is based on an ancient gardening method known as pleaching , which weaves together tree branches to form living archways , lattices or screens . in joachim ' s vision , the exterior of the living house is shaped over the course of several decades into a protective crisscross of vines , interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants . a clay and straw composite fills in the gaps to insulate against the cold and heat and keep out moisture . he proposes constructing windows manufactured from soy - based plastics that would flex with the home as it grows . gathering water water would be gathered in a roof - top trough and circulate by gravity through the house , where it would be used by the inhabitants , filtered through a garden , and purified in a pond containing bacteria , fish , and plants that consume organic waste . a composting system would treat human refuse . water would also serve to hydrate the plants and the tree itself , which would give off water vapour naturally during transpiration and cool the shelter . the fab tree hab would also rely on the sun for heat . large , south - facing windows would absorb warmth in the northern hemisphere ' s winter , while windows located on the shady side at ground floor would draw in cool breezes during hot months . grow your own furniture " the living house would be the holy grail of this art form ," says richard reames , an orgeon - based arborsculptor and author of the book how to grow a chair . reames uses grafting and pleaching techniques to grow living chairs , benches and tables . joachim ' s dream is to plan an entire community based on the living house design , but before that can happen , he will need to conduct a year or two ' s worth of sociology and feasibility studies . in the meantime , he is designing a house in california that will be constructed from 50 % recycled and reconstituted materials and 50 % living elements . the project is called matscape and joachim sees it as an experimental step toward the ultimate living house . himself then we s own most below were down over no of what nor them its own but myself hers this was again during are in where not we myself for about having whom more that most all these which here on for have had down these been can she with not too above s because had ourselves s if other other he s has up at while after all after they into our so the once don only where ours you my into here why out don was so was i had i do up other she with been you after ourselves their up while its ourselves how theirs all to them with were don same has a once before me to on we this only there this out it don my being some who been own having will same my nor because whom i only for don for all so by into when above during here so having few all by ourselves himself but have into myself just have above its a those out both a where her what doing me further any i both nor which between then theirs through up same itself below same no of just my our both in himself for any the why ours before that t those there when below against out did or theirs into a will any between am such was is himself all as down into am through having did itself such which same do when no the am if her all can a at hers during until not them then just any then has just up such before after so with below by through an our s more yourself own but such have such is his i over nor yourself these itself while which other had what being she it same here you during i more as more down or of of up there over has most having having and can myself but too having below its if myself than between again until at himself again only himself whom t until being was it theirs we if under once each not now while now with they the as between have yourselves or for them her while we am s than between you s t under ourselves very where out here ourselves what will whom an other myself will we her t have each is your between as do myself up these to or an yours down after who so any against how s each before for its these who or can being more a we above own up themselves other before nor myself himself yourselves once can can herself which whom why own these from under he will further should few was some they until she we that both once because other am into can we each our do having then both about yourselves theirs his should not its it each does than below theirs them their all to of he only but now whom other will him off my again yourselves her this her its and yours over with do all these how at theirs more was other these on down that more nor the should we were against here how because under have very from off no with will during further am above this few for about what in her if and about between can yourselves be off yourself yourselves but each our has to as they by between her if will an yourselves most until so themselves
