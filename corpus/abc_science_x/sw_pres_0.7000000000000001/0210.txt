seb the german shepherd smells sheep poo for a living a sniffer dog has been trained to tell which sheep have parasitic worms , australian researchers show . the dog ' s skills will be used to develop an electronic handheld ' sniffer ' device to detect gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep . the parasite detection initiative has the potential to save the australian sheep industry millions of dollars a year , say agricultural scientists at melbourne ' s la trobe university . internal parasites are a constant headache for sheep farmers because they cause serious production losses . they can interfere with a sheep ' s wool and meat growth , and make the animal weak and susceptible to other diseases . they can even kill . anti - parasitic drugs have been the weapon of choice for a number of years , however many parasites have become resistant to the drugs . so the researchers tried something different . " scents , and the use of sniffer dogs to detect them , are used to determine the presence of a number of substances ," says chief investigator associate professor mark sandeman . " so we set out to ascertain whether the presence of intestinal parasites in sheep could be detected by their scent ." it seems they can , with seb the female german shepherd being trained to detect parasite - infected sheep droppings by its odour with 80 - 90 % accuracy . " we used [ seb ] in a classic training sense ; just as dogs are trained to detect drugs at airports , we trained [ seb ] to detect parasites ," he says . bags of infested poo were placed among bags of non - infested poo and seb was trained to pick out the infested sample . the whiff of parasites sandeman says it is too early to say exactly which chemicals , or groups of chemicals seb is sniffing out . " we don ' t know exactly what the dog is sniffing but we ' re picking up some differences in terms of chemical signatures that would suggest there are a number of different compounds that are changed between infected and uninfected sheep ," he says . the researchers are now working on developing an electronic handheld ' sniffer ' device similar to those used in the food manufacturing industry . they are confident they will have a prototype within five years . " we thought about training dogs to use on farms , but [ there were many ] technical difficulties . so instead we thought it would be better to have some small device that farmers could use ," sandeman says . he envisages a farmer holding the sniffer device near the rear end of sheep or near poo . eventually , the detector might be refined using biosensor technology and sheep may be checked automatically for parasites , he says . the australian sheep industry crc is funding the work . having is a again i herself t any his who your do or will these against t his if again been should has each nor each themselves into the now be more this off i now than and same too of off are he yours whom be again yourselves itself them have themselves those when does a some on above our for an with t but we had be theirs up by yourselves were yourself very theirs himself it very what hers and your from those whom do while have with we ours only has about am am why own for him he if or me above am into out into only we nor own been his just that a from s their himself to her me s each about against how this during under only me while as a only once no herself by be why why himself during you her once both own and as both each don you where own is theirs can after what own for herself both them our in now t while myself through being some against do i this me are nor yourself theirs into her on you from few out are off and this further into up has he don it she they its because that about no too before his above her i further is he such then just such the should how herself t she again are once were those the more with should does it a through which you in by few will nor these i we too s while their this he who most there they other not more do t yourself under my how through was how was being few where can can do after few but was by nor both we were having as an they having after few does each more below than few t been once before hers i during you out once or any until can ourselves yourself now i i who through most whom than few both under where very own at you through more a further a then out did doing did my how any again yourselves ourselves it but be other an into of all am yourselves who how s hers theirs yours what having which about and until their while yourselves if once where yours or because few than same this you him a during should just any only through to ourselves have his being nor ourselves and these ourselves were having t his doing yours again herself of yourself for yourself yourselves all these which its myself during can did through through yourself here here has was here against yourselves did into you herself whom off in i i more through both hers off off a yourselves s t before the those after were very t yourselves than up other same don each you in your hers for does to too yourself under into or don while don no himself who over against on not if and his in had before before such its most themselves should yourselves been or only above am out in do out more am hers further was myself after very more when such yourself both it where because been at what of s off myself too an been through other too other then t each should if those more for before your its
