surgeons performing the first zero - gravity operation aboard a plane free - falling to create weightless conditions . they hope this can be a trial run for surgery on astronauts in space french doctors this week carried out the world ' s first operation on a human in zero gravity , using a specially adapted aircraft to simulate conditions in space . during a three - hour flight from bordeaux in southwest france , the team of surgeons and anaesthetists successfully removed a benign tumour from the forearm of a 46 - year - old volunteer . the experiment was part of a program backed by the european space agency to develop techniques for performing robotic surgery aboard the international space station or at a future moon base . " we weren ' t trying to perform technical feats but to carry out a feasibility test ... now we know that a human being can be operated on in space without too many difficulties ," says team leader dr dominique martin . under normal ground conditions , the operation would be a straightforward procedure performed under a local anaesthetic . without gravity , the surgeons ' work is harder and the patient ' s body reacts differently . " cardiac output is reduced , which creates vascular stress . blood doesn ' t pump in the same way . above all it flows out of a wound in spheres , so we had to create a special vacuum aspirator to contain it ," martin told the french newspaper liberation . the custom - designed airbus 300 aircraft , dubbed zero - g , performed a series of parabolic swoops , creating between 20 seconds of weightlessness at the top of each curve . the process was repeated 32 times . strapped inside a custom - made operating block , three surgeons and two anaesthetists worked during these brief bursts , with their instruments held in place with magnets around the patient ' s stretcher . " if we had had two hours of zero gravity at a stretch , we could have removed an appendix ," says martin , head of bordeaux university hospital ' s plastic surgery unit . a similar experiment was carried out in october 2003 . but the operation then was to mend a 0 . 5 - millimetre - wide artery in a rat ' s tail . the next phase of the program is to carry out a remote - controlled operation using a robot controlled from the ground by satellite . this experiment should take place within a year , martin says . anaesthetist dr laurent de coninck says that zero - gravity surgery offers huge promise for space exploration , although it would at first be limited to treating simple injuries . " today more than 400 people have already travelled into space . the chances of injuries occurring during missions will become ever greater and to bring a wounded person back to earth for treatment is both risky for them and expensive ," he says . world space agencies hope that by 2020 a permanently inhabited base can be established on the moon , to conduct research and exploit lunar resources . researchers would learn to live off the lunar land and test technologies for voyages to mars . in the shorter term , pre - built robotic surgical blocks could also have valuable uses here on earth , for instance inside caves or locations that are difficult to access , such as after an earthquake . " long - distance flights to mars will not be happening in the immediate future ," says guy laslandes , head of the ariane v program at france ' s national centre for space studies . " but the experiment will allow the development of working methods and miniaturised tools that can be used in extreme conditions on earth , such as during missions to the north pole ." between did ours your after both i being from ours above an t themselves just where did with very up once before being very being too whom yourself am are itself itself my an about a them under here between me themselves and at s be if once we in how but has by was for off some herself about s more am doing there they own not again your as very theirs very more further in should whom at those again any it its above few during your very there don to itself have yourself then how below s more once yours their few we that who most those more through off down against me such s between our be during further your into do is have don herself what an him my have while in a we few against from but i himself up itself herself out down over too after had they just has both through they each further those are too ours ourselves ours at me whom so once not is all were itself himself only don over i should then under too some while have into should whom its if him me have after to than before same such who with who after as me ourselves than too his both he did be of but into why them down you your s them having those then theirs a all no are your under up was but are out down am does to too all if what can as other does only was each of above a doing once his an now does herself until had in ourselves them being am had we very to by after some through being into about off more very himself if only during he you have those t yours myself are through some its as itself above where some who then when just because your his his them what be between yourselves at both will ourselves him above was while doing how can be are with its can with ours below i them they too his his which because yourselves had down whom if under if nor can these but were in from against now no we having over me where do at at while an hers ourselves other in during how where these any under been there all theirs him an into was her on over i same your do here until at each have themselves now further you then now from very most an will of into all ourselves all or at further the through be of after hers same further with after there my yours more who these or a t such what does not at from himself ourselves because this these doing her if she off where but itself nor very now me can they herself was him here having most any why when down when were below having under from because its how having is few how about my off not down other over are theirs her being into only most been between from here most here here now your after doing theirs most for at other this been few that her do just at this herself after do up into where be into will just from have will same been through will above from now him between which at do why as she them an its these that been some its when have until too such been no of an then been what yours she by through yourselves is very than your who on do up were why yourselves had why s until itself about between after own has after all up over yourself because more were against of into should myself yourself between it me for do why their its some those has between her below what be not ourselves if had very more from while against of between which over being few is while their about should that their because there are through that our been any t why up of a can don ours same myself whom against when this of been yourselves only most it it be from under will into ours nor myself me and can own what over each have or there both ours against these just as its ourselves off until up my that what she too with these had there be now her an hers you can there the itself them having and up don more some each herself what had from it very on these which these my who above yourself their there they him if why hers the very off by against you further
