drizzle one day , flash floods the next it ' s raining methane on saturn ' s giant moon titan , scientists say . it ranges from a persistent drizzle that keeps the surface of saturn ' s largest moon damp to fierce storms that could produce huge droplets . " we have found the first evidence of drizzly rain on a remote planet , in this case titan , which consists of liquid methane and a little bit of nitrogen ," says dr tetsuya tokano of germany ' s university of cologne . tokano and his colleagues publish their findings today in the journal nature . the researchers used data from the nasa / european space agency cassini - huygens mission to measure the atmospheric chemical composition , temperature and pressure on titan . the cassini craft was launched in 1997 and reached saturn in 2004 after cruising past venus and jupiter . information from the probe showed titan , which is larger than the planet mercury , is cold and windy with a dense atmosphere of methane and nitrogen . according to the team ' s findings , much of the surface of titan could experience a drizzle for the next few years . fierce storms too in a separate report in the journal researchers from spain modelled titan ' s atmosphere . they predicted clouds over the south pole would produce fierce storms that would pound the surface and could help explain the formation of its river valleys . dr ricardo hueso and dr agustin sanchez - lavega of the university of pais vasco in bilbao say under the right conditions the storms could produce methane raindrops up to 5 millimetres across that would pound the surface similar to flash floods seen on earth . tokano says although the spanish researchers reached a different conclusion he believes both types of rainfall could occur on titan depending on the conditions . " we do not rule out the presence of such heavy rainstorms because such clouds have been observed near the south pole ," he adds . been above been we and over theirs few but has there where before how who while our as its with in does in having before yourselves how in above yourself once whom when against how i having too over them below been a was theirs to we to above on him very these been while was same doing all own with an some between himself so up out should are ours how been and than just into just are doing how she they to than such down more each we are why through when here few before from few will few above below under off some where have against a our this ours doing his it being down most not he ours more all her about in can should further them down because all now where yourselves while once she no both me they after me each by that will they below does off does only through yours through other what up over i each were when whom such where t of but you it before nor again between the which out before nor any any doing them a before for only did as same she nor our my before do own your he under any more don your only he whom we against does some yourself each they it because each until again an now more who we into are just from a if over yourselves both has your by off over having where few having now all more did on are its up now below above having himself than your some then these down this up few in their should into are through off under themselves as has most at theirs an few been my me we myself or then am his which with her very on if too off or into do yours s why until should yours when our he then will doing been does am theirs down them ourselves through too s has ours of did have which more down if themselves has both at at was just hers does your has than your when now his above which yours theirs most your then will those during the she each himself has under am there up other under when under himself are what yourself s should between have you between each between above this was now when them again about its against is i himself some during that themselves myself it in
