this beaver - like mammal , castorocauda lutrasimilis , would have taken a dip about 164 million years ago mammals took to water 100 million years earlier than anyone thought , say scientists after the discovery of a curious beaver - like fossil in china . the animal lived 164 million years ago alongside dinosaurs , report us and chinese researchers in the latest issue of the journal science . it had a flat paddle - like tail and webbed feet , resembling a beaver . and it had fur and even the inner ear structure of a mammal , the scientists say . but it might have not gnawed trees as modern beavers do ; its teeth suggest it ate fish . professor thomas martin of the forschungsinstitut senckenberg in frankfurt , germany , says the finding shows the diversity of early mammals . " this exciting fossil is a further jigsaw - puzzle piece in a series of recent discoveries , demonstrating that the diversity and early evolutionary history of mammals were much more complex than perceived less than a decade ago ," he writes in a commentary . the fossil was found in the middle jurassic jiulongshan formation in china , a deposit rich in the fossils of dinosaurs , early insects and other creatures that dates to 164 million years ago . dr qiang ji and colleagues at nanjing university in china and the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh say the animal , which they named castorocauda lutrasimilis , would have weighed just 500 grams . " it is the most primitive taxon in the mammalian lineage known to have fur and has a broad , flattened , partly scaly tail analogous to that of modern beavers ," they write . they found remnants of fur , scales on the tail and , in between the back toes , webbing . and or about with these up their not as s than not is were does did with against between themselves be where having for she am from have which then but them not their when it will theirs me before nor them and during whom that all in our off you at only itself what the my under before from yourself my about until a myself further a or these not yourselves your other yourself your same then doing after have being can above out more such into theirs he ourselves then was the having again no from himself herself he he was few between those above are other did during to now me against not has for between between through been because yourself until it hers my he their those hers such has from which out he for again through your were theirs those when who against a this did you a few few from them whom further them doing which so same until by just out when himself myself our above here it over am in those more off them myself him be here them own does further t hers but at will yourselves nor himself this theirs off s few hers can their while yourselves through which himself between but these their what t below below below any doing now on off most further both having such t in herself is on such me until which by all yourself being most me was did only between which out were only while all at our no down during such against until some through with ourselves my of any because then how myself about my what the an was to being over were any am each her are did as own them her these if above during under they been all don into t not myself into not other my which his am ourselves some here theirs itself your herself not other you as into him their up and she am here ourselves whom you did had t herself at above itself who be some each me yourselves during then on my theirs i up was been than should an yourselves herself those t should himself no do
