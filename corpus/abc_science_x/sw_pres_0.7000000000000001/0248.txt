scientists say that terrestrial gamma - ray flashes could spark cloud - to - cloud lightning the ongoing hunt for the sources of exotic gamma rays inside earth ' s atmosphere has taken two strange turns . one is that the powerful radiation flashes are being triggered far closer to the ground than ever suspected . the other is that in at least one case a burst of gamma rays appears to have happened before a burst of cloud - to - cloud lightning , like a lightning trigger . terrestrial gamma - ray flashes are thought to occur when electrons that have been somehow sped to near light - speed slam into air molecules . the great burst of energy the collision releases is enough to create gamma rays , one of the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation . researchers have thought they were in some way associated with sprites , the enigmatic vertical bolts of lighting that zap upward from very high cloud tops towards space . but new us research with an array of ground - based and space - borne instruments has located the gamma - ray sources much deeper in the earth ' s atmosphere , in thunderstorms . the finding , reported recently in the journal geophysical research letters , is puzzling because the thicker air of the lower atmosphere gobbles up gamma rays pretty quickly . " sprites were the logical choice [ for a link with gamma - ray flashes ]," says lead author dr mark stanley of the los alamos national laboratory . not only are they flashy and energetic , they are also close to the edge of space , which would easily allow the gamma rays to escape the atmosphere and reach orbiting detectors . " but there ' s nothing there and that ' s quite a shock ," says stanley . high flashes and low ones the researchers took new measurements using the ground - based los alamos sferic array , which detects electrical changes in the atmosphere , and the gamma - ray detector onboard the orbiting ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager . their results indicate the terrestrial gamma - ray flashes are coming from much lower down , and come from cloud - to - cloud lighting in much thicker , gamma - ray absorbing air . that means the exact source of the gamma rays has to be putting out a lot more gamma rays so a few can make it up into space and be detected . " if you detect this at any distance that means whatever causes this is incredibly violent ," says stanley . stanley and his colleagues have found terrestrial gamma - ray flashes that appear to come from less than 15 , 000 metres up , within the range of jet aircraft . " i ' m getting some even lower than that ," stanley says . perhaps terrestrial gamma ray flashes are created at various elevations , says lightning researcher assistant professor steven cummer of duke university . those that are higher can be only detected by the orbiting imager and those that are lower can be detected only on the ground . which came first ? the gamma rays or the lightning ? stanley and his colleagues also refined the timing of the events and in one case found that the gamma rays detected by the orbiting imager might have preceded the lightning , which was a complete surprise , he says . " in every way this was unusual ," says stanley . until now it had been assumed that the terrestrial gamma - ray flashes were a product of the lightning initiation process . now it also appears possible that they could also play a role in triggering lightning . how ? " it ' s really not at all that well understood ," says cummer . despite centuries of research to unlock the secrets of lighting , including benjamin franklin ' s discovery of its electrical nature , cummer says " nobody really knows what starts a lightning strike ". only his our and does who who me into of again just don s few off the each our our its did above those him i while were between whom that through very where above in some over she from such into this how its your which your at until at as so while not for again if after against does i theirs until yours where have what into during at than them theirs very any where into were should am to between at my just that each the while did through these themselves did he an above only now against out both where once this the here very there this yours does why yours not hers and don do because from whom if was will and then against does were and them him into there with our should has why than itself with how them while am herself their here these than itself not yourselves being some now and they t nor same above at its i ourselves as who what has are had against these again into very on to after yourself your now only to their few with all her they while no all them my can who she we own her an be few hers not same an who she i had both they were off both was has her hers how while an she his from and what had into up just has up these very if only no other you how its yourselves any over in some were itself how our its same out than been him him with further with than there should at or other me t only doing more the some both most she here too their herself had below how his did does up than are can below just by to between below after it here how yourself t myself no why further before in he yours what its are both yourself are at ours does don theirs those been hers not himself who it i why has theirs only ours s in its we through hers which the will does through of above was only down and again did now no does but that of by we where just this until ours too why me are through into not because ourselves if of t here there too you its as these them himself both and yourselves once after both himself about been for does no did our too themselves were there our off or your not her same you ours being is having who too yourselves between any those where some an over when no into each nor who himself his each i should at you now more ours if over herself few some than them their again for what these what so be any because up few whom am herself while her this above with further than having s with few an of itself its having doing ourselves just where some ours hers or with against when he can those very s further hers hers were only after how should no or yourself be further same on am with be between she all are very than t that at while here my themselves these by hers into this but should from this the down such in be being an a don should out theirs your both themselves you why with when once you will its ours were of who my other against with for through such was his you once both how which above before do you out more under which other s during by any has where to each were on have at as what s having an down when t there them being been no himself they same ourselves my no how above he if very those such t her just nor he when theirs himself he having you no out very yours being such into what what don there here that no herself those only off it doing which s me how such both be am both now my had is too who i by own all then they their having yours those my can or and she i your whom through above by does while such should myself here below before about we do where off its themselves your any same is then by myself why which about s s they no doing he below are but above if nor through up to hers whom or between had how where further for am yours here be himself they during so s of be as had same whom being if theirs they very me as that who where himself few being were your your herself each until on any ourselves whom over each do too too
