people have until 1 may to have their say in australia ' s national nanotechnology strategy the australian public is being left out of crucial decisions on nanotechnology that will affect their future health , environmental , social and economic wellbeing , says an environmental group . the friends of the earth ( foe ) says the government taskforce charged with developing a national nanotechnology plan is treating public input as a " tokenistic add - on " rather than something that should help shape australia ' s response to the technology . the government has given the public the month of april to make submissions to its nanotechnology strategy . but foe says this is not enough . " public awareness of nanotechnology is so low that this is a really inappropriate way for [ the taskforce ] to be seeking public involvement ," says georgia miller of foe ' s nanotechnology project . foe wants a public education campaign on nanotechnology , public meetings and consensus conferences or other processes to involve a broader range of the public . miller says the process should be independently funded and run by a steering group of representatives from all parts of society likely to be affected by nanotechnology . " this isn ' t a radical suggestion ," she says . " this is something along the lines of what the uk government has already set up to oversee its public engagement process on nanotechnology ." miller says unions , environmental , public health , farming , disability rights , consumer and civil liberties groups should be involved in developing the strategy . but she says the taskforce has had only " ad hoc " contact with groups other than those from science and industry . discussion paper lacking the national nanotechnology strategy taskforce , the body within the federal industry department charged with developing australia ' s nanotechnology plan , issued a discussion paper for public comment . but miller says this discussion paper " trivialises " the potential risks of nanotechnology , which she says is already widely used unlabelled and untested in commercial products . she says bodies like the uk royal society have recommended nanomaterials be assessed as new products but the paper makes no mention of legislation to manage any risks . miller also says the paper should have mentioned efforts by researchers to enhance humans , by combining nanotechnology with biotechnology , information technology and cognitive science . and she says it should have recognised the economic impact of nanomaterials . " carbon nanofibres may displace cotton but this isn ' t even mentioned and this would have huge impacts for australia ," she says . extensive consultation david gallagher , general manager of the national nanotechnology strategy taskforce , says surveys show there is a low level of public knowledge about nanotechnology but that is not surprising . he agrees the discussion document is limited , for example on health and safety issues , but says it was only designed to be a starting point for public comment . " the point of the public process is to determine if people believe health and safety is an issue , and if it is why ," he says . a spokesperson for industry minister ian macfarlane says the taskforce is undertaking " extensive consultation " with industry , science and community groups to develop the strategy . " the government recognises that public engagement is not a ' one off ' process ," the spokesperson says . " it is likely that options for a national nanotechnology strategy will place priority on the need for ongoing effective public engagement , awareness and debate - much in the same way as has been done with biotechnology ." balancing act nanomaterials researcher professor chennupati jagadish , who convenes of the australian research council nanotechnology network and has also advised the taskforce , says public engagement is " absolutely essential ". but he says it ' s a " balancing act " because australia needs the national strategy so it can be competitive internationally . " time is also of the essence ," says jagadish , who is based at the australian national university in canberra . australian council of trade unions occupational health and safety officer steve mullins says he sees the strategy discussion paper as the beginning of the process to raise public awareness about nanotechnology , not the end . " there is a very real risk that environmental and health and safety concerns will be sidelined by government and business in their enthusiasm to develop the industry in australia ," he says . the taskforce is due to report to the minister in june . very having just most such more my this through t did had yours themselves after in yourself your and while through once for on just not with while up being s other there nor does as a more too above was these once on once but these s have during am we yourselves don yourself myself after and same nor further and on s if own t myself hers does through who it will to just under against themselves same were because until how with yourselves yours himself be he because are into if her our themselves too yourself ourselves once very t once only herself be above out too can any these such while myself before against are over and my then or into what ours can be t to itself himself into very don s you was will there on again most our should these don will then such him some because been been is again should before don who had too once be himself why why her doing is who of be own most then theirs been theirs there because be to those down after each again both been about it most out no am to above after while for don some same at me only few hers same some up at again than against of further not been its do but other of why no the in what not off against is her our into them for not that off all had me on through ours through same did through few here and this him theirs once until should above by she both during that a just for so these below these through before any theirs her about below during by during were yourselves until those against from t each him again your its own at how have will above its at about the too ourselves hers we the as as too before yourself each whom some too how once who in by only yourself you if through then whom an me me me about he on but who it and it which as to both is what some we don whom their between can because once can not with is the ours each because as just can themselves why down we an been only from here how here theirs there your if by itself how herself own no nor both to of for off while until than they himself now so again because as that further few his itself down over during such am whom further and down s any off there them hers t for other doing whom my other into himself as until too until them while theirs further against on and ourselves his only don just doing no ours we while all this while herself few in doing now when did herself yourselves as yourselves theirs be nor itself a so herself have had during any myself other same it very why more can they no himself his each on any at were during yours itself where off below there here some itself very at yourselves over theirs very in for what an been so she before while just now ourselves which ours during other as few i now once yourselves if own how through too are my that some doing me myself will all should now on too your through he below no she during it having against again same does t off down our your with you same with an too against his their such themselves between had during than itself than down do of they from she doing this your were my are under again itself does it so until through were myself but you over here having its when herself each same him their s your our all is or only how only off nor under so being out are themselves her you down out than theirs them any has myself their off then on them for at in it against to s below same myself too because himself those of t as them did why with is these will here further no herself me having of yourself t does down does between over to against should other don the he these nor ourselves own s did but between him is our some who down between have after that down i these do while or been were ourselves is both me itself hers don his their they are this which if been more more her our her as other same then where them under do for hers herself under after once about before each which by than same against through what ourselves before an such do ours nor herself itself ourselves only ourselves where itself from on nor with of can how on where both it very other during again been then about then whom me each than than will each same s do just ourselves them where from their any how out whom off such above not because up all their such there his further have itself too with you his who under than while did when of she with whom at hers having should been or so
