golf is hard enough to play well on earth . so how is a russian cosmonaut going to hit a ball into the right orbit in space ? a russian cosmonaut plans to whack a golf ball into orbit from the international space station , a publicity stunt that critics say would add to the growing problem of space junk . pavel vinogradov is to take on the role of a celestial tiger woods under a deal between a canadian golf club manufacturer and the cash - strapped russian space agency . in one of three space walks planned from the international space station over the next six months , vinogradov will climb aboard a special platform and swing a special gold - plated six iron and seek to enter the record books for the longest - ever golf drive . if all goes well , and nasa , the prime agency in building and running the space station , approves , his ball will orbit the earth for about four years . it would travel up to 3 . 36 billion kilometres before eventually burning up upon friction with the atmosphere . " every single record for distance in the golf industry will be shattered ," says element 21 golf co , the toronto firm behind the scheme . the ball will be fitted with a small radio transmitter allowing golf fans to track the ball on their home computer , says the company , which says it will give the club to charity . scientists , though , are less than gleeful . they say , in theory , it should be easy to hit the ball a huge distance . after all , us astronaut alan shepard exulted that his two historic 1971 golf shots on the moon , where gravity is a sixth of the earth ' s , went " miles and miles and miles ". on the space station , orbiting the earth at a height of some 350 kilometres , gravity is negligible and friction is zero , which should make it a golfer ' s dream . taking a shot but , as experienced golfers will tell you , driving that little white ball with the right force and in the right direction is a lot harder than it seems , even on a terrestrial course . the task is that much harder in a thick spacesuit , which leaves little room for a decent swing or flexing the joints . the ball thus could quite easily be mis - hit and travel only a couple of metres , or be hooked or sliced and sent in entirely the wrong direction . as a result , it could accidentally land in the same orbital plane as the space station . station and ball would both whizz around the planet on the same track , one after the other . and what that means is a remote risk of a collision , capable of damaging or even destroying the space station , depending on the angle , velocity and site of impact . " there ' s a lot of room in space , but orbital mechanics is a wonderful thing , and things tend to come back to where you launched them from ," says dr heiner klinkrad , acting head of space debris at the european space agency . " for the [ space station ], the most probable collision velocity in the worst - case scenario is somewhere at 10 to 11 kilometres per second ," he says . " this thing is certainly larger than a centimetre , which means it would certainly penetrate the shields of the space station if it hits at this speed ." the perfect swing dr jean - michel contant , secretary general of the international academy of astronautics , a paris - based forum on space research , suggests that vinogradov ' s boots be strapped to the platform and that he make a few practice swings on a tethered ball before doing the big drive . " if safety criteria are respected , this exercise could be useful as a teaching tool for children and students and be fun for the broad public ," he says . " but it holds out no scientific benefits ... and if the worst - case scenario happens , it won ' t be fun at all ." another problem is that of space junk , especially from exploded satellites and boosters , which is becoming a threat to satellites and travellers . " the international recommendations are that you should not throw out unnecessary objects , and i wouldn ' t qualify a golf ball as a mission - related object ," klinkrad says . junk in space the junk region of most concern is between 900 and 1000 kilometres above earth , where there are many navigation , communication and weather satellites . the golf ball would be far below this height . dr bill ailor , a director of the center for orbital and reentry debris studies at the aerospace corporation in el segundo , california , told new scientist magazine there are about 300 operational satellites in this low - orbit zone . these could in theory be at risk from the ball as it slowly spirals towards earth . " but the chance of something like that happening is probably very low ," says ailor . a nasa spokesperson says its engineers are vetting the planned golf drive for safety but was unable to say when this review would be completed . further before should down until when because further you myself while as up t because having once now do having why most above during has nor in or same than that an
