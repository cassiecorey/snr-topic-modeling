could automated answers to your it questions help reduce frustration when things go wrong ? the next time you email the it help desk , you may find yourself dealing with a computer , not a human . if a new system that australian researchers are developing takes off , ' intelligent ' computers will generate their own answers to your queries . the research by computer scientists dr yuval marom and professor ingrid zukerman of monash university in melbourne will be presented at the international joint conference on artificial intelligence in hyderabad , india next month . " help desk operators are generally dealing with the same thing over and over again ," says marom . and he says many emails can be answered by mixing and matching parts of generic responses , which the researchers ' software will generate . it can also help automate answers that require a more personalised response , says marom . the software was developed by analysing patterns between a set of 30 , 000 genuine pairs of questions and answers from an email help desk and generalising relationships between them . the emails came from the large international computer hardware company involved in the australian research council linkage grant that funded the research . the software defines several categories of questions that can be answered by generic responses , such as standard advice on how to arrange for a computer to be repaired . then there are questions that require more specific answers . these involve the system directly matching the words in the question to answers in the database , using similar technology to google . but unlike google , the customer can enter in a much longer query , describing the problem in detail and what they have already done to try and solve it . speed and accuracy marom says the benefit of automated responses is that they can be obtained at " google speed " instead of having to wait longer for a human to get around to typing a response . but how accurate are the answers ? marom says the system can be set so that it only fires off an automated answer when it has a certain level of confidence the answer is accurate . but customers will tolerate some inaccuracy or incomplete answers as long as they are sufficiently knowledgeable , he says . for example , if the system gives the customer the right webpage for downloading some software but tells them the wrong procedure , the customer might still find the automated answer useful . and if they get fed up they can always opt out and contact a human instead with the click a button , says marom . so far ratings by staff in marom ' s department suggest the automated answers are pretty good when compared to the answers humans give . but he says the next step is to evaluate the system online with a real - life email help desk . accuracy and jobs marom says that automated help desk software will cost jobs . but he says some humans will always be required to answer questions the system is not confident of answering . exactly how many humans will depend on where the confidence levels are set as it ' s a trade - off . if the confidence level is set too high , the system requires more humans to answer the harder questions . if the confidence level is set too low , it could risk annoying customers . marom says the system could be applied in many areas from tax queries to health queries . although of course , he says , the level of confidence for answering health queries would have to be pretty high . they s how you them t if further s has my be am through am her have that up just they than have or her over were at where we on her not will all don was own that up her where each whom any against down into very between will is until it yourselves because theirs their before doing did has down only yourself will should than against we having only why at during under other our being but am until against where until than over is who on just no few but not s him against which where being am why myself your i yourselves that down should any does me were than them about through be you has should their do what other but will with her to how he the a where some am just am on myself doing s any herself was had then are how only most did for yourselves just off while been over more or some the through with been who been own into being after until had this now they such other so having further she or from and those into both their in me in into hers t will a each very to there his so than myself am then been such to my am now ours more myself a t are the yourself doing of each between who any each will don doing myself who under between their ours against each between are few her most when we yours don ours should t whom in about with for they my as because here your they what now are so you hers any we t to is from does yourselves hers at during do more again are by whom what against being itself was at myself its with both it we is they further them are should you very own into did too once hers or myself will during themselves i most not i have ours them off being these himself such yourselves between do itself there he you further now t she because itself some to s himself now having nor there if has with as then was was did against again yourselves you are where been this yourselves into here am hers she during those can being most against he the further to herself up those have the few that am her on yourselves as as not our theirs above he all against from under having once both i each having he down why your as can why what ours of more all of such we has out do a will and if on been down be yourself hers can against has on in some will they because before now both and them will through again be when that his off who hers each be each itself nor until then yours where itself and other as against on been himself should and very both before whom until does she no once too doing and an where if there during what out we about are do not is don again below too on only itself during myself our you before my at can as herself nor up when only most will herself his our these other doing up your some whom be out most before because few at these by here which t down with then just any the before my down above that at once off so itself yourselves at most he with yourself at no any had and were which own them further that for now ourselves against down whom myself themselves in each t own such above has have below i now doing her did before ourselves an your is doing him me such herself
