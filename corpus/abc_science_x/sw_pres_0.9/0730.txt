big brown bats , like this one , navigate over long distances using the earth ' s magnetic field as a guide scientists believe a species of bat has an in - built magnetic compass to find its way home over long distances , in addition to its famous echolocation , which guides it around its neighbourhood . princeton university batologists publish their findings today in the journal nature . the researchers used radio telemetry aboard a small aircraft to track big brown bats ( eptesicus fuscus ) that were released 20 kilometres north of their home . they first tested a control group of bats , which headed due south towards the roost without a problem . two other groups of bats were then exposed to a false magnetic field for 90 minutes , 45 minutes before and 45 minutes after sunset . one field was 90 & deg ; clockwise and the other was 90 & deg ; anticlockwise from magnetic north . the point of this was to see whether the bats used earth ' s magnetic field as a guide and , if so , to see whether the bats used sunset or the stars as an additional cue . the ' clockwise ' group of bats flew due east , while the ' anticlockwise ' group went due west , suggesting that they had been using a magnetic compass that may have been calibrated by the sunset . but some of the bats corrected their course and arrived home safely , which implies that , like homing pigeons , they can make a fix if a navigational glitch occurs . world ' s longest bat tongue ? meanwhile , another study , also published by nature , sheds light on a remarkable bat species whose tongues are one and half times longer than their bodies . the nectar bat ( anoura fistulata ) lives in the cloud forests of the ecuadorean andes , feeding on flowers whose nectar is hidden at the end of long funnels . nathan muchhala , of the university of miami , suggests the extreme length of the bat ' s tongue coevolved with the long flowers of the plant . at with about his over but each under does yourselves ours this
