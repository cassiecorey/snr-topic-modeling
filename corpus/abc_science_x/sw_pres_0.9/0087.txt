most of the world ' s sharks live at depths that commercial trawlers can access , a new study shows ocean depths beyond 2000 metres are almost devoid of sharks , a finding that is grim news for these threatened fish , a study finds . an international team of researchers publishes its findings in the journal proceedings of the royal society b . the researchers used deep - sea trawls , baited hooks and baited cameras to see where sharks live , testing depths in the atlantic , pacific and indian oceans and mediterranean sea from 471 to 5900 metres . they generally saw or caught sharks at up to 2000 metres , but there were few sharks beyond this depth . the deepest specimen was the leafscale gulper shark , caught at 3280 metres . this means that there are no reserves of sharks living in the abysses , rarely - explored depths that are beyond 3000 metres that comprise 70 % of the oceans ' volume . as a result , almost all sharks are within reach of modern deep - sea trawlers , which can net fish to a depth of up to 2300 metres . " sharks are apparently confined to about 30 % of the total ocean , and distribution of many species is fragmented around sea mounts , ocean ridges and ocean margins ," says the paper , which mentions other chondrichthyes , a category that also includes skates and rays . " all populations are therefore within reach of human fisheries , and there is no hidden reserve of chondrichthyan biomass or biodiversity in the deep sea . sharks may be more vulnerable to over - exploitation than previously thought ." endangered or facing extinction of the 490 species of shark , 25 are endangered or facing extinction , according to the red list of threatened biodiversity compiled by the world conservation union ( iucn ). but this number is set to grow , in the light of new data assessed by the iucn ' s group of shark experts , the swiss - based agency says . many shark species are very slow - growing , which means that a sudden drop in numbers can threaten their survival . shark species have been ravaged by commercial trawling . they are scooped up accidentally as bycatch by trawlers hunting more lucrative fish , and are also being increasingly targeted for their fins , which are used for the chinese shark - fin soup , and for their liver , which is rich in oil . some species of chondrichthyan fish have adapted to the extreme pressures and poor light of the deep ocean . the shark , though , seems to be excluded from life in the abysses because of a lack of food down there and the relatively high buoyancy of its liver , says the paper , by professor imants priede of scotland ' s university of aberdeen . below now hers which do doing
