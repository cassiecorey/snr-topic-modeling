some children with autism really can empathise with others , researchers say people with autism are more intelligent and able to function better than previously believed , experts say . but mistrust of doctors , biased tests and the internet have bred myths about the condition . at a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science , researchers presented reports showing that even people with autism who do not speak can have above - average intelligence . they also offered additional studies disputing claims that vaccines can cause autism . " the current figures are that 75 % of autistic people are mentally retarded , with the mute the most ... impaired ," says canadian researcher dr laurent mottron , an autism researcher at montreal ' s h & ocirc ; pital rivi & egrave ; re - des - prairies . but mottron believes the wrong intelligence tests are used to assess autistic children . many are tested using the wechsler scale , a common iq test that includes questions about words and concepts learned in school . the raven ' s progressive matrices test measures abstract reasoning and consistently gives autistic children higher scores , mottron says . the average boost in score is 30 points , mottron says , enough to put someone previously considered mentally retarded into the normal range and the average to gifted status . mottron was so impressed by the abilities of one autistic student , michelle dawson , that he made her a co - author of some of his papers . autism is a term used to describe a broad range of symptoms , from an inability to use language normally , to exhibiting deeply disturbed and repetitive behaviours . professor morton gernsbacher at the university of wisconsin - madison questioned a common idea among autism researchers that autistic people lack a ' theory of mind '. this , among other things , gives an ability to empathise with others . again , she says , the wrong tests are used to assess this ability . is there an autism epidemic dr judith grether , a california epidemiologist , says she questions the idea that there is a new autism epidemic . she says it is impossible to find out how many cases of autism there were in the past , because many people with autism were often diagnosed as retarded , or never diagnosed . without that information , it is impossible to say if the number of cases has grown , she says . " we have to do the studies to find the answers ," she says . grether says us researchers have begun taking prenatal blood samples from pregnant women and will look for clues when and if some of their children are diagnosed with autism . they are examining hormones , heavy metals , immune system proteins and other factors . the studies found no link with vaccines , says dr irving gottesman , a psychiatrist at the university of minnesota , but says the us centers for disease control and prevention has initiated four studies " to tie up the loose ends ". new studies are focusing on genetic susceptibilities . link with vaccines gottesman says the studies may help to ease the fears of parents that a vaccine - autism link has been covered up . but he says scientists are battling a plethora of websites devoted to the idea that mercury causes autism like http :// www . safeminds . org . gernsbacher , the mother of a child with autism , says some parents may join these lobbying groups over the advice of doctors because they get " pat answers " to initial concerns about their children . many may have been told that boys develop later than girls , for instance . " the mistrust [ of government - funded studies and of their paediatricians ] may have arisen from those kind of experiences ," she says . until these have against an with other over these his s below
