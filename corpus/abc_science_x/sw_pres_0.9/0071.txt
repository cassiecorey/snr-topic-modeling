babies have an innate ability to do simple maths . while counting toes is beyond them , then can match voices to the number of people in a room even before babies learn to talk they have a bit of a grasp of maths , according to new research concluding that infants may have an abstract sense of numerical concepts . the us research , published in the latest issue of proceedings of the national academy of sciences , says seven - month - old babies demonstrate an ability to match the number of voices they hear to the number of faces they expect to see . the study of 20 infants by researchers at duke university was similar to a previous experiment to demonstrate that monkeys show numerical perception across senses . in the new study , babies listened either to two or three women simultaneously saying the word ' look '. at the same time , the infants could choose between video images of two or three women saying the word . as they had found with the monkeys , the researchers say the babies spent significantly more time looking at the video image that matched the number of women talking . " as a result of our experiments , we conclude that the babies are showing an internal representation of ' two - ness ' or three - ness ' that is separate from sensory modalities and thus reflects an abstract internal process ," writes researcher dr elizabeth brannon , an assistant professor in psychological and brain sciences . " these results support the idea that there is a shared system between preverbal infants and nonverbal animals for representing numbers ," she says . " what we do know is that somehow , very quickly , [ the babies ] acquire this ability to perceive number and divorce it from the sensory information ." understanding the research could be useful in devising methods for teaching basic maths skills to the very young , brannon says . this have then its against into when they any too doing now into all than me during or but by does his their was her
