drizzle one day , flash floods the next it ' s raining methane on saturn ' s giant moon titan , scientists say . it ranges from a persistent drizzle that keeps the surface of saturn ' s largest moon damp to fierce storms that could produce huge droplets . " we have found the first evidence of drizzly rain on a remote planet , in this case titan , which consists of liquid methane and a little bit of nitrogen ," says dr tetsuya tokano of germany ' s university of cologne . tokano and his colleagues publish their findings today in the journal nature . the researchers used data from the nasa / european space agency cassini - huygens mission to measure the atmospheric chemical composition , temperature and pressure on titan . the cassini craft was launched in 1997 and reached saturn in 2004 after cruising past venus and jupiter . information from the probe showed titan , which is larger than the planet mercury , is cold and windy with a dense atmosphere of methane and nitrogen . according to the team ' s findings , much of the surface of titan could experience a drizzle for the next few years . fierce storms too in a separate report in the journal researchers from spain modelled titan ' s atmosphere . they predicted clouds over the south pole would produce fierce storms that would pound the surface and could help explain the formation of its river valleys . dr ricardo hueso and dr agustin sanchez - lavega of the university of pais vasco in bilbao say under the right conditions the storms could produce methane raindrops up to 5 millimetres across that would pound the surface similar to flash floods seen on earth . tokano says although the spanish researchers reached a different conclusion he believes both types of rainfall could occur on titan depending on the conditions . " we do not rule out the presence of such heavy rainstorms because such clouds have been observed near the south pole ," he adds . or no itself into from been our did its for all do some your these so
