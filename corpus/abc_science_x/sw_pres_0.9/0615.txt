the site where this hand and forearm stencil was found is 4000 - 5000 years old fieldwork in what ' s believed to be one of the most significant rock art sites in australia has stalled after the federal government declined to fund further research , archaeologists say . over the weekend scientists exploring the wollemi national park northwest of sydney announced the discovery of numerous shelters , many with rock drawings and stencils up to 5000 years old . they also discovered what ' s believed to be the first hafted stone axe found in southeastern australia , estimated to be around 150 years old . but now the archaeologists are being forced to look for international funding to continue their work and can ' t even afford a day trip to the remote area to protect vulnerable sites from damage by bushfires , says team co - leader professor paul taçon of griffith university . the largest and most significant site , an engraved platform a few kilometres from where the axe was found , is at immediate risk , taçon says . the platform features large eagle and koala figures and images of what are believed to be ancestral beings . " there is a lot of vegetation around the edge of the platform and fallen tree limbs which will provide fuel [ for bushfires ]," he says . " if we get a really hot one in the next few months there is a risk that some of the engravings we ' ve discovered won ' t be there any more . " ideally it would be good to ... just go in to clear it up but at the moment we don ' t have any funding to do anything at all ." taçon says the australian research council informed him last week that his grant application , worth several hundred thousand dollars a year over the next five years , had been knocked back in favour of international projects . " the application was for further work in the wollemi and other parts of the country on rock art ," he says . " it looks like no rock art projects will be getting up , and hardly any australian archaeology projects at all . most of the money went for people working on archaeological projects overseas ." he says the latest trip and previous surveys of the wollemi bushland , where the jurassic - era wollemi pine was also discovered , have been funded by team members and international organisations . the researchers are currently talking to a new zealand company for funding to help them return for more surveying in april . " given what we ' ve found on each trip there ' s probably lots more out there ," he says . an australian research council spokesperson could not comment on individual funding applications , but confirms some applications for international archaeological projects were successful in the last round . " yes , we did fund a number of archaeological projects ... and several involved research overseas ," she says . " but it is all by researchers who reside predominantly in australia ." the future of the axe meanwhile the future of the axe , which still has traces of resin most likely made from plants and beeswax , remains up in the air . taçon says it will either remain undisturbed in the cave where it was found or be moved to the australian museum in sydney for public display . " perhaps it can remain and eventually turn to dust ," he says . " sometimes removing objects destroys the context and connection to the larger landscape and history of a particular area ." but a final decision about whether the axe should stay or go will be made by local aboriginal groups , he says . dave pross , from the darkinjung local aboriginal land council , wants to see the axe in a museum to prevent it being picked up by bushwalkers and ending up on an online auction site like many other aboriginal artefacts . he ' ll argue for this at the next land council meeting . " my view is to get it out and put it into a museum because bushwalkers can come in , find something and put it on ebay ," he says . " let ' s put these things in a museum , as long as they can be used for a display , or showed to students , and they ' ll be safe ." how into under if while yours up they from was if which while just
