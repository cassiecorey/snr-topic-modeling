keeping cut fruit chilled is the key to keeping vitamin c levels high , food scientists show health conscious but time poor ? grab a pack of packaged ready - to - eat fruit and your body will be none the wiser . that ' s the message from new international research showing that chilled , ready - to - eat , fresh - cut fruit retains high levels of vitamin c and other antioxidants . cutting and packaging fruit has almost no effect on the main antioxidants , scientists report in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry . in fact , levels of some antioxidants increased in selected fruits . researchers including those from the university of california , davis , took pineapples , watermelon , rockmelon , strawberries , mangoes and kiwifruits and processed half as fresh - cut and left half whole . both lots of fruit were refrigerated under identical conditions for nine days before being tested for nutrient content . tests revealed only small losses of antioxidant compounds in the cut fruit compared to fruit left whole . for example , losses in vitamin c after six days at 5 & deg ; c were less than 5 % in mango , strawberry and watermelon pieces , 10 % in pineapple pieces , 12 % in kiwifruit and 25 % in rockmelon cubes . no losses in carotenoids , free radical scavengers that are thought to enhance the immune system , were found in kiwifruit slices and watermelon . losses in other fruits ranged from 10 - 15 % in rockmelon , mango and strawberry to 25 % in pineapple . interestingly , total carotenoid content increased in mango and watermelon cubes in response to light exposure . the findings don ' t surprise australian food technologist keith richardson , who says cold is generally the key to keeping nutritional content . " the fruits and vegetables are chilled prior to cutting and they don ' t gain a lot of temperature during the processing operation . then they ' re promptly returned to below 5 % before being sent out [ in refrigerated trucks to sit in refrigerated supermarket cabinets ]," he says . richardson , a food technology liaison officer with food science australia , says provided the cold chain is kept " you wouldn ' t expect a significant loss of nutrients ". " generally speaking , the colder you keep fruit the slower its metabolism , including any breakdown of nutrients ." meanwhile , the research team says further studies are now needed to evaluate the effect of treatments on the nutrient retention of fresh - cut fruits . this include treatments like modified atmosphere packaging and chemical dips for delaying softening and browning . whom can why
