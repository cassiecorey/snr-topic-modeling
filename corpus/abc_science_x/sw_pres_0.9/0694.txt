scientists say they haven ' t heard from the mars global surveyor in weeks nasa scientists conceded that the 10 - year - old mars global surveyor is probably lost in space after the us agency tried unsuccessfully for two weeks to make contact . the spacecraft , the oldest of five nasa robotic explorers studying mars , was circling the planet snapping high - resolution images and studying the climate . it was on a mission that led to the first evidence that water once flowed on the planet ' s surface . the probe went silent after reporting problems with a sticky solar panel , and scans of the skies have produced no sign of it . "[ mars global surveyor ] was a fantastic mission . it has really revolutionised how we look at mars ," says dr fuk li , mars exploration program manager . " we haven ' t given up hope , but we are all ready to celebrate a long life and a job well done ." one chance remained this week to recover the probe , which has been programmed to transmit a signal to nasa ' s robotic geology station , opportunity , located near mars ' equator . opportunity will relay any signal from the orbiter to earth during passes this week via the mars odyssey . " if [ mars global surveyor ] is in the sky and its [ transmitter ] is on , then opportunity should receive it ," says dr john callas , project manager for the mars exploration rover mission . scientists at nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , lost contact with the spacecraft on 2 november after it signalled it was having trouble moving one of its solar panels to track the sun as it emerged from behind mars . the spacecraft is programmed to position itself so that a stuck panel faces the sun , but that orientation could block its communication with mission controllers , says tom thorpe , the mars global surveyor project manager . power problem if mars global surveyor is turned away from the sun for more than a few orbits it could be low on power , an outcome that seemed to be supported by the spacecraft ' s apparent failure to respond to commands that would raise its transmitter , thorpe says . " we don ' t believe the [ solar ] panel is in any way degraded ... the problem seems to be the gimble motor that is sticking ," thorpe says . " why we can ' t raise the transmitter could be a function of the power problem ." mission scientists first hailed the orbiter via the deep space network , receiving what they believed was a weak carrier signal from the probe two or three days into the search . then it went silent . they then turned to the newly arrived mars reconnaissance orbiter , which used its onboard cameras during recent passes near mars global surveyor ' s last known orbit . but that probe had no definitive sightings of its sister craft . if opportunity records no sign of mars global surveyor , scientists say they will have exhausted the most likely possibilities for contacting it . the 10 - year mission , which was extended four times , cost a relatively modest us $ 377 million ( a $ 489 million ). mars global surveyor ' s cameras were the first to record topographic features suggesting flowing water on mars , and its magnometer found the remains of magnetic fields that once shielded mars ' surface from deadly cosmic rays . its mineral mapping helped scientists choose landing sites for opportunity and its twin , spirit , and will be used to evaluate landing sites for the next - generation of mars surface probes , the phoenix and the mars science laboratory . been up up only any under by their theirs of at does do who those before such above we that same to which have once few out how this than
