this false - colour image of earth shows heat escaping to space . greenhouse gases trap such heat to warm the planet greenhouse gases in 2004 reached their highest ever levels in the atmosphere , says the un ' s meteorological agency . a bulletin from the world meteorological organization ( wmo ) says the gases carbon dioxide ( co2 ), methane and nitrous oxide " all reached new highs in 2004 ". officials also indicate that a near record year - on - year rise in co2 levels for 2005 recorded by us monitors , well above the average for the past 10 years , would not come as a major surprise . " global observations coordinated by wmo show that levels of co2 , the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere , continue to increase steadily and show no signs of levelling off ," says wmo secretary - general michel jarraud . in its first greenhouse gas bulletin , to be an annual publication , the wmo says that in 2004 atmospheric co2 levels stood at 377 . 1 parts per million , 35 % higher than in the pre - industrial age , before about 1750 . methane has risen 155 % in the modern age , the wmo says , but its growth is slowing . and nitrous oxide is rising consistently , with levels increasing 18 % in modern times . the wmo says these three gases alone contribute to about 88 % of warming over the same period . the average annual increase in absolute amounts of co2 in the atmosphere over the past decade has been 1 . 9 parts per million , slightly higher than the 1 . 8 parts per million of 2004 , says wmo environment division chief dr leonard barrie . barrie says reports by national oceanic and atmospheric administration that co2 had grown last year by 2 . 6 parts per million had to be viewed in perspective . " it is important to take the long view . there can be fluctuations ," he says . " the 2 . 6 parts per million figure is within past experience . if it were to persist over several years , then we would have to start talking about what it means ." doing did so about an once has
