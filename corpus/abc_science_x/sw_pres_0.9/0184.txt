the 2004 boxing day tsunami destroyed the forest that once grew along this indian coastline mangroves and coastal forests offer little or no protection against tsunamis , says new research that debunks earlier findings . last year researchers studied 17 coastal villages in the tamil nadu region of india in the months after the 2004 boxing day tsunami . they concluded that death rates were lower in villages fronted by mangroves . but when researchers including those from the australian research council ' s centre of excellence for coral reef studies analysed the data they found a very different story . " the most important determinants of the number of people that died [ in the tamil nadu region ] were the distance of the village from the coast and its height above sea level ," says co - author and australian marine ecologist dr andrew baird . " in effect , there was no protective function of these coastal forests ." baird says while the hypothesis of the original research was reasonable , it was not borne out by their findings , published in the april issue of the journal estuarine and coastal shelf science . their analysis revealed that the distance of a village from the coast and the height of the village above sea level explained 87 % of the variation in mortality among villages . once these two variables were taken into account , vegetation area seemed to account for less than 1 % of the variation . " mangroves and intact coastal ecosystems are wonderful and necessary things ... but they won ' t protect you from tsunamis ," baird says . " we ' re concerned that by telling people that mangroves and coastal forest will protect them from a tsunami will give [ people ] a false sense of security . " when the next wave comes people may be misled into thinking that they are safe because their village is fronted by a mangrove forest . " the other concern is that the concept of ' green belts ' and buffer zones is being used as an excuse by the tourism industry and other interests such as plantation owners to move people away from their homes and livelihoods and take this land from them ." baird says people would be better to concentrate on early - warning systems and effective evaluation strategies in the event of another tsunami . " that ' s the way you ' re going to save lives ," he says . researchers from the university of guam and the wildlife conservation society - indonesia program were also involved in the new analysis .
