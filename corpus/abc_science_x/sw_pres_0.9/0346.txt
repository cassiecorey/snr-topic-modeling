ansto says the radiation released from its site was well within regulatory limits and will not affect the health of workers or the community the operator of australia ' s only nuclear reactor has rejected claims that radioactivity released from its site raises safety concerns . the opposition labor party claims the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ( ansto ) has withheld details about an accident at the lucas heights facility in sydney last week . a pipe inside a " hot cell " used to produce medical isotopes ruptured last thursday evening disrupting production of radiopharmaceutical technetium - 99n , used in the scanning of bones and organs . " only one worker was in the vicinity of the incident , but after examination he has been found not to have received any radiation dose ," ansto said in a release at the time . " no measurable contamination was found outside the immediate area where the incident occurred , and there are no off - site consequences ." but shadow minister for science and research , jenny macklin , said yesterday she had obtained an internal email from ansto that contained information not previously released by the organisation . the email said a small amount of radioactive gases ( xenon and krypton ) had been released through the stack and the worker involved had received a very small amount of contamination . the email said the radiation was quickly washed off the worker and a whole body monitor examination confirmed that he received no internal radiation exposure . " trivial " incident in a follow - up statement this week ansto rejected macklin ' s claims that it had not made relevant information about the incident public . ansto described the incident as " trivial ", although said it had nonetheless informed the regulator , the australian radiation protection and nuclear safety agency . small amounts of radioactive gases are routinely released during radiopharmaceutical manufacture , and reported to the public via ansto ' s annual environmental reports , ansto said . it also said that while the doses received by the public as a result of those releases are so low as not to be directly measurable , they can be calculated . the total maximum annual estimated dose to a member of the public from those releases is only a very small fraction of the radiation dose received by everyone each year from naturally - occurring sources of radiation , ansto said . " the releases which occurred last thursday evening were not outside the normal release pattern , were well within regulatory limits and could not be detected off - site ," the statement said . nuclear debate australia holds about 40 % of the world ' s known uranium reserves and is a major exporter of the material . there is currently debate in australia over government investigations into whether to set up a nuclear power and enrichment industry in the country . " accidents like this show that the community is right to be concerned about the safety of nuclear reactors ," macklin said . " this accident is a stark reminder that things can go wrong with nuclear reactors ." but ansto rejected macklin ' s linking of last week ' s incident with nuclear reactor safety . " the incident did not occur in the reactor , and has nothing to do with reactor safety ," it said . " this is just deliberate scare - mongering by labor in relation to a medical research reactor that delivers radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals to cancer patients across australia ," science minister , julie bishop told abc radio news . the 48 - year - old lucas heights plant is australia ' s only nuclear reactor and produces radioisotopes for use in more than 440 , 000 nuclear medicine procedures each year . not this been below whom yourself after had its when had all so few an themselves who before than who our how now my so himself we when some s i where those to how each can as
