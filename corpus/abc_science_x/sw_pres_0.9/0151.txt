female eastern whipbirds sing with a regional accent , which biologists say may be related to coordinating reproductive activities female whipbirds in australia sing the same basic songs , but with regional accents , researchers show . female birds in general rarely sing , so this latest find itself is unusual . but the find is doubly noteworthy because the scientists observed that the males of this species , psophodes olivaceus , sing with no accent whatsoever . " it is so intriguing to see both of these opposite patterns occurring within the same species ," says lead researcher daniel mennill , a professor of behavioural ecology at the university of windsor in canada . " you wouldn ' t be shocked to visit one town and hear people speak with a twang , and then visit another town and hear a drawl ," he says . " but can you imagine if , in your travels , you found that females sounded different in each town , but males had the same brogue ? these whipbirds demonstrate such a pattern ." mennill and his colleague amy rogers , from the university of melbourne , measured eastern whipbird recordings from 16 different populations along the east coast of australia . for each of the 112 birds they recorded , they measured the song ' s number of syllables , the length of the first syllable , the highest and lowest frequency of the last syllable , the time between these frequency extremes and other characteristics . the vast majority of female recordings showed variations on each of these criteria , but male songs were all virtually identical . the researchers publish their findings in a recent issue of the journal of avian biology and post samples of the birdsong on their website . cracking the whip in the wild , the males and females sing duets . males initiate the duet with a long whistle and an ear - splitting ' whip crack '. females then respond with a sharp ' chew chew '. " in my opinion , the ' whip crack ' sound might be the most extraordinary note produced by any beast in the animal kingdom ," mennill says . " it involves a pure tone that ascends or descends extremely rapidly across a very broad frequency spectrum . it is possible that this note is difficult to perform , and that females may favour males who are capable of executing this difficult note effectively ." while males must sing their hearts out for females , both males and females engage in their own same - sex singing contests . for these contests , usually each bird will perch itself near its territory boundaries . birds then sing back and forth , trying to match the song sung by the opponent . often the songs wind up overlapping . interesting findings peter slater , a professor of natural history at the university of st andrews in scotland , agrees with the findings . " the real surprise here is the stereotypy [ repetitive sameness ] of the males ... in some other birds , females appear to choose mates on the basis that they perform a song that is quite hard to produce . i like the idea that the whip crack may be such a phenomenon and this might explain its very unusual stereotypy ," slater says . in terms of accents , he says that geographical variations , or dialects , are found in other songbirds , whales , seals and primates . mennill suggests that females may benefit by sharing songs that are similar to those of nearby females . while these benefits remain unclear , it is possible that the singing helps to somehow coordinate reproductive activities . male eastern whipbirds perhaps might have evolved accents too , if it were not for their impressive ' whip crack ' song with its stunning finale . below himself of those am a more more him were no has what can and her all herself that too off now she while which after itself both my below
