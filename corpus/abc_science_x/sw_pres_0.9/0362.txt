interestingly , the study found testosterone levels did not explain the differences between male and female war - mongering the first scientific proof that men who are over - confident and narcissistic are more likely to start wars , has been published this week . but such men are also the most likely to lose wars , the study found . a team led by dr dominic johnson of princeton university in new jersey , report their findings online ahead of print publication in the royal society journal proceedings b . they recruited 200 men and women in an unusual experiment aimed at exploring whether a bias towards optimism may drive a leader to start a war . the volunteers were asked to play a one - on - one computer game . each played the role of the head of a fictitious country that is in conflict with a neighbour over a vast field of diamonds on a disputed border . players were each given us $ 20 for taking part , but earned an additional bounty of $ 10 per game if they won , either by amassing the most wealth or by defeating their opponent . before the game , each player was asked to rank himself or herself , predicting how he or she would fare against the 199 others . in the game , each player was given a virtual treasure chest of us $ 100 million , which they could spend on upgrading their military , investing in industrial infrastructure or keep in reserve as cash . as the game unfolded , the player was given updates about his opponent ' s actions . players could negotiate deals in which they could get access to the disputed diamonds , thus adding to their wealth , but they also had the option of waging war at any time and without provocation . victory in war would be determined by how much they had spent on their military , but there was an element of chance , too - the computer equivalent of a roll of the dice . males five times more likely to attack more than 1 , 000 decisions were taken by the players during six rounds of the games . of these , 70 % involved negotiation ( something that could be done both during peace and during a war ); 20 & nbsp ;% involved doing nothing ; 6 % involved fighting ; and 4 % to make a threat . wars occurred in almost half of the games . individuals who launched unprovoked attacks were more than five times likelier to be a male than female . and they were big on self - confidence , too . on average , a warmonger ranked himself 60 out of the 200 players , whereas those who tried to avoid war ranked themselves more humbly , at 75 on average . testosterone levels contrary to popular belief , though , testosterone was not a key factor . the players gave a saliva test before the game , and these showed there was no significant difference in male hormone levels between warmongers and peaceniks . on the other hand , there was a clear psychological characteristic among the warmongers . after the game , they were given a personality assessment , which found high levels of narcissism among the men - but not among the women . the researchers ' theory is that humans have a built - in bias towards optimism because it is a survival mechanism . by encouraging hope , called " positive illusions ," our distant ancestors could cope with adversity , strengthen their resolve and bluff their opponents . but the question is when " positive illusions " become over - confidence - and the impact that this can have in modern - day society , on a president or a prime minister who believes that a war , despite its risks , can be won quickly and easily . ironically , the higher the self - ranking , the lower the actual performance , johnson ' s team found . " those who expected to do best tended to do worst ," the researchers say . " this suggests that positive illusions were not only misguided , but actually may have been detrimental to performance ." don for these when these about more once so into for such such to again which
