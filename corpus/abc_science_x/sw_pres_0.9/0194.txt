ant from the genus ectatomma foraging at the project amazonas field station in peru ants evolved far earlier than previously believed , as far back as 140 million to 168 million years ago , us researchers report . and these insects have plants to thank for their diversity , the harvard university team reports today in the journal science . the researchers used a genetic clock to reconstruct the history of ants and found the ant family first arose more than 40 million years earlier than previously thought . but ants did not diversify into different genera and species until flowering plants came onto the scene , the researchers conclude . the study sheds light on one of the most important and numerous animals , which includes hundreds of different species . " we estimate that ant diversification took off approximately 100 million years ago , along with the rise of flowering plants , the angiosperms ," says team leader professor naomi pierce . " these plants provided ants with new habitats both in the forest canopy and in the more complex leaf litter on the forest floor , and the herbivorous insects that evolved alongside flowering plants provided food for ants ." the researchers reconstructed the ant family tree using dna sequencing of six genes from 139 ant genera , encompassing 19 of 20 ant subfamilies around the world . such molecular clocks are widely used , alongside fossil and other evidence , to determine how old species are . they work on the basis that dna mutates at a steady and calculable rate . the researchers found that the poorly known ant subfamily leptanillinae is the most ancient , followed by two broad groups known as the poneroids , or predatory hunting ants , and the formicoids , the more familiar species such as pavement ants and carpenter ants . during what no yours than should t himself too of which because me who being before was if before is own off under why itself against any there
