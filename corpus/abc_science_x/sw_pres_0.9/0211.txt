hello mr personality ! researchers are learning that squid have distinct character traits squid have personalities that appear to be passed down from parent to offspring , says an australian researcher . but those traits can be modified by environment , says dr david sinn , who will present his research at the australasian association for the study of animal behaviour conference in sydney this week . sinn , a research fellow at the university of tasmania , observed behaviour in the southern dumpling squid ( euprymna tasmanica ), which is found in waters around south australia , victoria and tasmania . in general , these squid tend to be solitary , unromantic animals with a propensity to cannibalise their neighbours and take sexual favours by force , he says . within that profile sinn found some squid are shy , retiring , cautious types while others are bold , assertive and adventurous . " it turns out some squid are bolder than others ," he says . " for example , when presented by a threatening stimulus they attack the stimulus or are ambivalent to it . " others are shyer , they don ' t inspect a threat , they back up , they flee ." assertiveness training for squid previous research suggests these character traits in squid are up to 30 % hereditary , he says . but there ' s evidence that some squid can adapt to their environment by learning to either temper their overconfidence or shake off their shyness . sinn says squid and other cephalopods like octopuses and cuttlefish are relatively intelligent and , relative to body size , have brains the size of cats . this is probably to compensate for the loss of their protective shells during evolution , he says , with more brain capacity needed to protect their vulnerable bodies from predators . population dynamics sinn says understanding the ecology and evolution of personality provides a key to understanding what drives animal populations . he says it ' s unclear which personality traits confer an evolutionary edge , although it appears that having a mix of personalities is essential for a population to survive a disturbance . " individual behaviour is going to determine how far [ an animal population ] disperses , its growth rate , how well it survives and potentially how it reproduces , so all these things are driving population dynamics ," he says . " if you want to know how to predict population abundance maybe we need to know more about individual behaviours and how they ' re going to react to environmental change ." squid lovers sinn ' s next project is to investigate the role of personality in the sex life of squid . he says mating in the squid world is forceful on the part of the male but females play a role in choosing to associate with prospective mates or in attempting to rebuff unwanted advances . he says early evidence suggests bolder females prefer bolder males while shy females are less choosy . sinn also intends to look at personality in lizards . if which when as am this s after yourselves them very in same has himself him our yours those does out down can where once did be in in or has above my were same because any
