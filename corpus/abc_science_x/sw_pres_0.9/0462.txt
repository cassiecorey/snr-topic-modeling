last year ' s lockhart review recommended that australia ' s ban on therapeutic cloning be lifted . but the federal government has ruled out a conscience vote . so where does that leave research ? the head of the uk genetics institute that produced the world ' s first cloned human embryo has accused australia of damaging the international research effort by refusing to allow therapeutic cloning . professor john burn , medical director of the institute of human genetics at the university of newcastle upon tyne , was commenting after prime minister john howard ruled out a conscience vote on whether therapeutic cloning should be allowed in australia . " it ' s a cost to the international research effort because australia ' s a very important component of it and it ' s a shame that that position ' s been adopted ," says burn , who is in brisbane for the 11th international congress on human genetics . therapeutic cloning , which involves the creation of an embryo for research and to harvest stem cells , is distinct from reproductive cloning , which results in a human being . both practices are currently banned in australia although the independent lockhart review last year recommended the ban on therapeutic cloning should be scrapped . burn ' s unit received europe ' s first cloning licence in 2004 and researchers announced the following year that they had created a cloned embryo by somatic cell nuclear transfer . this year his team reported they had produced mice from sperm grown from embryonic stem cells . a shadow over stem cell research but the uk ' s 2005 cloning achievement was overshadowed by south korean professor woo suk hwang . hwang had apparently beaten burn ' s team by claiming just months before that this team had cloned human embryos and produced stem cell lines from them . hwang later admitted fabricating that claim . the scandal was a major setback for embryonic stem cell research , burn says . he says it damaged the credibility of the field and had made it harder for scientists to do their work because it had brought about increased regulation and requirements . " although we were very pleased to have actually been the first , it did cast a huge shadow over the whole field and every paper submitted now has to be backed up with endless evidence ," he says . prime minister john howard ruled out a conscience vote on therapeutic cloning over the weekend but says he is still happy to have a party room debate on the matter . forcing a brain drain burn says the australian government is making an ill - informed and " too cautious " decision not to adopt the recommendations of the lockhart review . the decision will continue to force australia ' s top scientists offshore , he says . " clearly if people feel unable to work on a topic they will move ," he says . he says the university of newcastle upon tyne has formed an alliance with melbourne ' s monash university to work on embryonic stem cell research . " it may well be that by strategic alliance the australian scientists will find a way around the federal obstruction ," he says . burn says the promise of stem cell research is " absolutely undeniable ". " i think if the prime minister approaches this in a democratic way then the vast majority of australians would want this research to go ahead ," he says . " and i think the vast majority of australians would say if it ' s ok in britain we can ' t see why it ' s not ok in australia ." through in who our him not up been at do our here whom yourself s her
