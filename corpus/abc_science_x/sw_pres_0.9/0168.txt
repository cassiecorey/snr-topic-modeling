total solar eclipse , as seen in 2002 it has been called the sun - eating dragon , the spirit of the dead and the eye of god . it has been a harbinger of great events , good and evil - famines , bumper harvests , wars , and the birth and death of kings . later today , we ' ll know it as the total eclipse of the sun , when the moon will be perfectly aligned with our star , and the lunar shadow will alight on the tip of eastern brazil . racing eastwards across the atlantic , the umbra will reach the coast of ghana , then head across togo , benin , nigeria , niger , chad , libya , where the eclipse will be at its longest , lasting 4 minutes , 7 seconds , and then northwestern egypt . it will then zip across the mediterranean , passing between crete and cyprus before making landfall in turkey , traversing georgia , southern russia and then in kazakhstan . the shadow briefly crosses russia again before expiring at sunset in mongolia after a marathon of 3 hours , 12 minutes and 14 , 500 kilometres . around 2500 kilometres either side of this path of totality , observers will get a partial eclipse . for instance , about a fifth of the sun will be obscured in the uk , southern sweden and the southern gulf . australia is among countries unable to see the eclipse . but abc science online brings you photos , videos and commentary of the event as seen from turkey . see chasing the sun in turkey for more information . far back in time eclipses are infrequent events , and their rarity is enhanced by the fact that most take place over the ocean , which covers two - thirds of the world ' s surface , and so they go unwitnessed except by seafarers and remote islanders . but writings dating back to the dawn of civilisation testify to thrill and dread as the sun , the bringer of life , was gradually blotted out , the stars appeared in an indigo sky , the terrified birds stopped singing and bats left their roost . " nothing can be surprising any more , or impossible or miraculous , now that zeus , father of the olympians , has made night out of noonday , hiding the bright sunlight , and ... fear has come upon mankind ," wrote the greek poet archilochus after an eclipse in 648 bc . " after this , men can believe anything , expect anything . " don ' t any of you be surprised in future if land beasts change places with dolphins and go to live in their salty pastures , and get to like the sounding waves of the sea more than the land , while the dolphins prefer the mountains ." for the ancient chinese , the eclipse was a sun - eating dragon , which had to be scared away by the banging of cymbals and pans . for the vikings , it was caused by two chasing wolves , skoll and hati . hindu mythology blames a demon called rahu who spitefully takes a bite out of the sun from time to time . even today , in some cultures , eclipses are believed to bring poisonous vapours and so food and water containers are turned upside - down in protection . watching and waiting the most - observed solar eclipse took place in 1999 , when the path of totality crossed major population centres in europe , the middle east and asia . this year , no big city lies directly on the 185 kilometre - wide path , although several , including ankara , lagos and tbilisi , lie very close to it and will get a near - total eclipse . the luckiest of all are people who inhabit the mountains of central turkey , says nasa ' s veteran eclipse specialist , dr fred espenak . " a quarter million people in sivas have the opportunity of witnessing a second total eclipse from their homes in less than seven years ," he says . in them not ourselves about these he yourself be
