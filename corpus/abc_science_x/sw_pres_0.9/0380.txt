discovery poised for launch bad weather has forced the us space agency to postpone the launch of the space shuttle discovery . the next launch is set for 04 : 38 wednesday australian eastern standard time ( 18 : 38 tuesday utc ). the decision by nasa to cancel lift - off came minutes after the seven crew members boarded the spaceship , even before the vessel ' s hatch was closed . hours before , nasa forecasters estimated there was only a 30 & nbsp ;% chance that weather conditions would favour a launch , as thunderclouds menaced the kennedy space center . " we ' ve concluded that we ' re not going to have a chance to launch today ," launch director mike leinbach told the crew as they sat strapped into their shuttle seats . " ok , we copy ," said shuttle commander steve lindsey . " looking out the window , it doesn ' t look good today , and we think that ' s a great plan ." too many risks the mission management team ' s chairman john shannon confirmed bad weather had prevented the launch . " we had the vehicle ready to go , the crew ready to go and it ' s just that one thing that we really don ' t control , the weather , that kept us from launching ," he told reporters . any rain during lift - off might damage the spaceship ' s heat - shielding tiles , and a lightning strike could knock out the computers that control the ship . even thick , high clouds can make a launch hazardous . discovery ' s mission is only the second since the 2003 columbia accident , and another disaster or serious problem could end the shuttle program . nasa is hoping to fly 16 more missions to complete the a $ 134 . 5 billion ( us $ 100 billion ) space station before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010 . debates over safety shuttle safety has been at the forefront of the program since columbia disintegrated on re - entry in 2003 , killing seven astronauts . nasa has twice redesigned the shuttle ' s fuel tank , which shed insulating foam that triggered the accident . the agency ' s top engineer and chief of safety wanted more repairs on the tank before discovery was launched , but nasa administrator michael griffin overruled them , arguing that if foam falls again from the fuel tank and damages the shuttle , the crew could stay aboard the space station and await rescue . griffin says the debate over safety is a good thing . " nasa had been criticised in the past for adhering to groupthink , for enforcing a needless conformity in decision - making ," he said on cnn ' s late edition ." " we have difficult , technically complex and subtle decisions to make ... we did the best analysis we can , and we make a decision , and i ' m comfortable with that ." delaying the launch would put more pressure on the shuttles , which are the only vehicles that can deliver and install the station ' s remaining trusses , solar arrays and laboratories . the agency plans two more flights this year and about four a year until the station is finished and the fleet is retired . nasa had hoped to resume space station construction last year , but the shuttle ' s fuel tank failed its first test flight . engineers then removed two long wind deflectors from the tank , which had shed foam during discovery ' s 2005 lift - off . after a above only all yourselves if in very out our should no about
