who needs ghostbusters when you ' ve got newton , says a scientist who has used physics and maths to poke holes in the way hollywood depicts ghosts and vampires . in a paper , published recently on the physics website arxiv , theoretical physicist professor costas efthimiou of the university of central florida shows that when it comes to things supernatural , the figures just don ' t add up . for instance , the ability to walk through walls is a common talent of celluloid ghosts . but newton ' s laws of physics suggest that if a ghost can walk it shouldn ' t be able to pass through walls , say efthimiou and cornell university postgraduate student sohan gandhi . newton says a body at rest will remain at rest until it ' s acted on by an external force and for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction . so in order to walk , we apply a backward force on the floor with our feet , propelling the feet up and us forwards . but if a ghost can walk through walls , it must be " material - less ", the authors argue , and incapable of exerting force . by the same token , a ghost that can walk through walls should also sink through the floor , and a ghost that can walk should be bouncing off the walls it tries to pass through . " the depiction of ghosts walking contradicts the precept that ghosts are material - less ," they write . ghostly chills sharp drops in temperature are also associated with the arrival of a ghost . but the paper says physics , which suggests that a sense of cold is correlated more to the rate at which heat is transferred from bodies to the environment than actual temperature , can provide an explanation . " it has become almost a hollywood cliché that the entrance of a ghostly presence be foreshadowed by a sudden and overwhelming chill ," they write . " this feature of supposed ghost sightings lends itself naturally to physical explanation ." efthimiou and gandhi say when a warm object is placed next to a cold object , energy flows from the warm body to the cooler body , cooling the warm body . in a room with a high window or a door with a gap , the cool air from outside displaces warm air inside , creating a system of heat cycles and eddies . the effect is increased because humans are more sensitive to rapid changes in temperature even if the absolute change is small . a 2001 uk investigation of the famous haunted gallery at hampton court , by the university of hertfordshire ' s dr richard wiseman , found that hidden doors were letting in draughts . this produced a combination of air currents that caused temperatures to plummet up to 2 ° c in some parts , the paper says . blood suckers ? efthimiou and gandhi also use the mathematical principle of geometric progression to rule out the existence of vampires . they argue it would take just two and a half years for vampires to wipe out the entire human race from the day the first one appeared , based on the myth that vampires turn their victims into other vampires by sucking their blood . if vampires feed once a month , the great grandaddy of all vampires would have killed one human and produced one vampire in the first month . so in total there would be two vampires and one less human , or a tally of vampires 2 , humans - 1 . by the next month , the 2 vampires would kill 2 humans , and so on . after n months there would be 2 x 2 x 2 ... x 2 = 2 ^ n , or a geometric progression with ratio 2 . " the vampire population increases geometrically and the human population decreases geometrically ," they say . using the principle of reductio ad absurdum , they conclude that vampires can ' t exist as their existence contradicts the existence of humans . professor alan carey , dean of the mathematical sciences institute at the australian national university , says the paper successfully debunks the depictions of the supernatural in the movies . " they poke holes in the clichés and mistakes that are made , and that ' s not too hard to do ," he says . own theirs their than such she with is or had themselves both has were up was myself against
