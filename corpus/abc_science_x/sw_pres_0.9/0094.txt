ecstasy use has risen 70 % between 1995 and 2000 , says the un ecstasy , the drug that some doctors blame for depression and anxiety , may often only enhance these symptoms rather than cause them , according to a study published today . dutch researchers found that children who suffered from depression were more likely to go on to use the illegal drug when they grew up to make them feel better . the appearance later in life of mental health problems in these people might not therefore be primarily due to their use of ecstasy , but could reflect pre - existing conditions . " using ecstasy may increase a risk that is already there ," says anja huizink , assistant professor at the erasmus medical center in rotterdam , author of the study that appears in the british medical journal today . " other studies claim that ecstasy leads to depression ," huizink says . " sometimes that is the case . but perhaps it is more the case that individuals who already have an increased risk for depression are more likely to use ecstasy ." clubbers ecstasy , methylenedioxymethamphetamine or mdma , was used in the 1970s to treat depression . it helps the body to relax , reduces inhibitions , increases energy and brings feelings of euphoria . the drug is now used by millions of young people around the world , especially clubbers who say it can help them dance all night . united nations data suggests the use of ecstasy surged by 70 % between 1995 and 2000 . but ecstasy has increasingly been linked with health problems such as depression , especially where individuals have used the drug heavily over a long time . the dutch study of 1580 individuals over 14 years left open the possibility that ecstasy might cause depression in some cases . " perhaps for individuals who did not display symptoms of depression and anxiety in childhood , using a lot of ecstasy may also cause depression . we are not saying that is not the case , but we need more studies ," says huizink . more than a decade later she and her colleagues first looked at their sample in 1983 , before ecstasy appeared as a recreational drug in the netherlands . use of the drug was then assessed 14 years later . individuals with signs of anxiety and depression in 1983 showed an increased risk of starting to use ecstasy . the researchers say other factors not tested in their study could account for some people to be more likely to use ecstasy . these included the social environment , novelty seeking and the substance use of parents . " focusing on these vulnerable individuals in future studies will increase our insight into the potential harmful effects of mdma ," they conclude . for more information about ecstasy and other drugs
