an instrument on board this nasa satellite measured simultaneous vertical profiles of ozone and other compounds earth ' s protective ozone layer , which was notably thinning in 1980 , may be fully recovered by mid - century , climate scientists say . ozone in the stratosphere , outside the polar regions , stopped thinning in 1997 , the scientists found after analysing 25 years worth of observations . the analysis will be published in the journal of geophysical research - atmospheres . the ozone layer shields the planet from the sun ' s harmful ultraviolet radiation . but human - made chemicals , notably the chlorofluorocarbons found in some refrigerants and aerosol propellants , depleted this stratospheric ozone , causing the protective layer to get thinner . the scientists say the ozone layer ' s comeback is due in large part to compliance with the 1987 international montreal protocol , which aimed to limit emissions of ozone - depleting chemicals . " these results confirm the montreal protocol and its amendments have succeeded in stopping the loss of ozone in the stratosphere ," says dr eun - su yang of the georgia institute of technology , who led a team that analysed the data . " at the current recovery rate ... the global ozone layer could be restored to 1980 levels - the time that scientists first noticed the harmful effects human activities were having on atmospheric ozone - sometime in the middle of this century ," yang says . researchers from nasa and other agencies reported in june that the so - called ozone hole over antarctica would recover by around 2068 , which is some 20 years later than previously expected . the antarctic ozone hole is a massive loss of ozone that occurs each spring in the southern hemisphere . a similar , though smaller and less severe , ozone hole has been reported in the arctic . while ozone is a beneficial shield in the stratosphere , some 10 to 50 kilometres above earth ' s surface , the ozone encountered at ground level can be damaging to lung tissue and plants and is a major component of smog . further these off t until myself were up and him below you and than here further her his before its being been when had
