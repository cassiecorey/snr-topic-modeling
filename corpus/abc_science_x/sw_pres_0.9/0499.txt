adelaide - born terence tao was a full professor at the age of 24 australian prodigy professor terence tao has won the mathematics world ' s version of a nobel prize , the fields medal , for contributions to harmonic analysis and numerical theory . tao , aged just 31 , wins the medal with russian recluse dr grigory perelman , frenchman professor wendelin werner and russian professor andrei okunkov . the medal is another claim to fame for the adelaide - born academic who earned his phd from princeton university at 21 and was full professor of mathematics at the university of california , los angeles ( ucla ) at 24 . asked why he devotes himself to pushing the boundaries of the discipline , tao says : " because it ' s fun ." " what interests me is the connection between maths and the real world ," he said , following an awards ceremony at the international congress of mathematicians in madrid . eemeritus professor alf van der poorten , of the centre for number theory research at macquarie university in sydney , salutes tao ' s achievement . " it ' s a wonderful thing for australian mathematics . he was a young genius and [ australia ] had people in place to look after him . he comes back quite regularly ," says van der poorten . professor john garnett , former ucla college chair of mathematics , recently placed tao on a level with mozart , " except without mozart ' s personality problems ". " mathematics just flows out of him ," garnett says . tao was awarded the fields medal for his work on a branch of maths that uses equations from physics in the theoretical field of harmonic analysis , a discipline that focuses on acoustic wave frequencies . he also specialises in disciplines including algebraic geometry and number theory . another branch of tao ' s research has been prime numbers , based on theories first put forward more than two thousand years ago by the greek mathematician euclid . russian recluse meanwhile perelman , the russian mathematician who won the medal with tao , declined to attend the ceremony , choosing instead to stay at home and watch television . he declined to comment on the award and on the reasons why he is shunning publicity . perelman resigned from the steklov mathematics institute suddenly in january without explanation . former colleagues say they have not seen him since . in 1996 , perelman won an award at the second european congress of mathematics in budapest . russian newspapers say that he turned down the prize because he considered the jury insufficiently qualified . but perelman ' s international fame in the mathematics world came in 2002 and 2003 when he published two papers online that appeared to solve the poincar & eacute ; conjecture . the riddle had perplexed mathematicians since it was posited by frenchman henri poincare in 1904 . in just 61 pages of sketchily written notes , perelman seemed to prove it but he never published a full proof in academic journals . the conjecture was one of the so - called millenium prize problems for which the clay mathematics institute in boston announced a one - million - dollar prize . perelman never picked up the prize money . they over there off against will don
