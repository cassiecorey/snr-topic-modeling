tall men have the advantage when it comes to speed - dating if you want to be a big hit at speed - dating , walk tall , say uk scientists . their survey found that taller men are more likely to get a date . the university of essex scientists calculated that for every 2 . 5 centimetres taller a man is than his speed - dating rivals , the number of women who want to meet him goes up by about 5 %. dr michele belot and dr marco francesconi analysed the choices made by 1800 men and 1800 women at 84 speed - dating events . they found that women prefer men who are young and tall , while men are more attracted to women who are young and thin . " what we try to show is that there is a pattern in how people choose each other ," says belot . but she readily concedes that science does not have the answer to all affairs of the heart . " it is true we can explain quite a lot , but there is still a part that is unexplained . that is where love will play a role ," she says . but , in the unforgiving numbers game of love , age is crucial . each extra year , in comparison with others in the speed - dating group , reduces a man ' s chance of finding a partner by 4 %. for women it is 5 %. and it is often all about the luck of the draw on the big night . should a man of average height turn up at the speed - dating event , all is not lost . if all his male rivals are short , then women may decide that he does measure up after all . " we also found that an overweight woman is 16 % less likely to receive a proposal from men . men , on the other hand do not seem to be penalised for being overweight ," belot says . the survey also explodes the myth that blondes have more fun . hair colour was not a major issue when speed - dating . and when the big night was over , women were much pickier than men , choosing only 2 . 6 men as possible future dates . to add insult to injury , almost half of the women said they did not want to see any of the men again . from by below myself his my he am during here here after just before by
