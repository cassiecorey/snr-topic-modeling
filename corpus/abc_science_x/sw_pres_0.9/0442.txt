sensitive tastebuds may explain why your kids won ' t eat broccoli , carrots or cucumbers picky kids who won ' t eat vegetables may be particularly sensitive to bitter flavours , a new study shows . these preschoolers turn up their noses at not only bitter vegetables , like broccoli and olives , but sometimes also sweeter vegies like carrots and red peppers . the findings suggest that innately sensitive tastebuds help explain why some children are so staunchly opposed to vegetables , the study authors report in the latest issue of the american journal of clinical nutrition . in recent years , scientists have identified a gene , dubbed tas2r38 , that controls a receptor for bitter flavour . a study published last year found that children with certain variations of that gene are particularly sensitive tasters , able to detect a very small amount of a bitter - tasting compound in water . the 65 preschoolers in the current study were tested the same way . a total of 37 % said the water tasted " yucky " or bad , while the rest couldn ' t taste anything and were considered " nontasters ". when the children were given free range to snack on bitter - tasting vegetables ( broccoli , olives and cucumbers ) and sweeter ones ( carrots and red peppers ), the sensitive kids ate significantly fewer bitter vegetables . and while only 8 % of nontaster children refused all of the vegetables , 32 % of the sensitive tasters did so . at the dinner table so what should parents make of all this ? according to the researchers , parents of fussy eaters should recognise that their children may not be having the same taste experience that they are . " parents should try not to project their own food preferences onto their children ," says study co - author dr beverly tepper , a professor of food science at rutgers university . a nontaster parent who loves broccoli , for instance , may have a more bitter - sensitive child who simply doesn ' t enjoy the greens in the same way , she says . but that doesn ' t mean that bitter - sensitive kids are destined to shun vegetables their whole lives , a potential comfort to parents who regularly engage in mealtime struggles . " we do change our food preferences as we grow and learn ," tepper says , noting that the " impact of genetics isn ' t set in stone ". whether there ' s a more immediate fix to the bitter - sensitivity issue is unclear . a tasty sauce might make vegetables more palatable to a sensitive child , but dousing veggies with toppings may not be the most nutritionally sound choice , tepper says . serving vegetables cooked rather than raw might help , she says , as cooking takes some of the bite out . been who himself that off nor too then from down so over yours on nor does should off so was
