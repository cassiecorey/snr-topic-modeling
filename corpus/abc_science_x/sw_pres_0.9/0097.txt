this beaver - like mammal , castorocauda lutrasimilis , would have taken a dip about 164 million years ago mammals took to water 100 million years earlier than anyone thought , say scientists after the discovery of a curious beaver - like fossil in china . the animal lived 164 million years ago alongside dinosaurs , report us and chinese researchers in the latest issue of the journal science . it had a flat paddle - like tail and webbed feet , resembling a beaver . and it had fur and even the inner ear structure of a mammal , the scientists say . but it might have not gnawed trees as modern beavers do ; its teeth suggest it ate fish . professor thomas martin of the forschungsinstitut senckenberg in frankfurt , germany , says the finding shows the diversity of early mammals . " this exciting fossil is a further jigsaw - puzzle piece in a series of recent discoveries , demonstrating that the diversity and early evolutionary history of mammals were much more complex than perceived less than a decade ago ," he writes in a commentary . the fossil was found in the middle jurassic jiulongshan formation in china , a deposit rich in the fossils of dinosaurs , early insects and other creatures that dates to 164 million years ago . dr qiang ji and colleagues at nanjing university in china and the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh say the animal , which they named castorocauda lutrasimilis , would have weighed just 500 grams . " it is the most primitive taxon in the mammalian lineage known to have fur and has a broad , flattened , partly scaly tail analogous to that of modern beavers ," they write . they found remnants of fur , scales on the tail and , in between the back toes , webbing . any when for its after as very its over no at of and our yourself its our only have of should in off more themselves why which
