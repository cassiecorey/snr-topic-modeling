the chemical composition of the sun appears very different to what we assumed , analysis of moon soil has revealed analysis of the first sample of lunar soil collected by neil armstrong has thrown into disarray what researchers believe about the sun , an international team of scientists says . dr trevor ireland from the australian national university and colleagues report in the journal nature today the results of a study of oxygen isotopes on the surface of soil grains returned to earth by the 1969 apollo 11 mission . it was hoped the study would provide clues about the chemical make - up of the sun and the proto - planetary soup that gave birth to our solar system . in particular , researchers hoped to find evidence for either of the two reigning theories about the sun ' s composition . according to one theory , the sun has a similar oxygen composition to the planets . the other theory suggests it has enriched levels of the isotope oxygen - 16 . instead , the study indicates that while the sun is dissimilar to bodies like the earth and meteorites , it has lower levels of oxygen - 16 than expected . " this was a completely unexpected result for us ," ireland says . " our sun is not the sun that we thought it was ." the finding also suggests the sun somehow ended up with a different composition from the cloud of dust and gas that preceded it , ireland says . he says this is based on other small rocky bodies , known as carbonate chondrites , which are the oldest known things in the solar system and have up to 500 times more oxygen - 16 than other oxygen isotopes . solar winds ireland says while we can ' t get samples directly from the sun , we can infer its composition by looking at lunar samples , which are believed to reflect its composition . this is because lunar soil contains oxygen isotopes " implanted " by solar winds carrying elements blown out from the sun . but after using a caesium beam to erode the surface of the soil grains and measure the isotopes oxygen - 16 , oxygen - 17 and oxygen - 18 , the researchers discovered unexpectedly low levels of oxygen - 16 . " we found that the oxygen ... did not agree with either a planetary composition or the oxygen - 16 rich composition ," ireland says . " the oxygen isotopes are telling us that the mix of components in the sun is different to that in the planets , particularly in regard to the amount of dust versus gas that comprises the sun versus the planets ." ireland says an analysis of oxygen from jupiter ' s atmosphere , comets and other bodies in the solar system could shed more light on the mystery . into t is those had very have again
