higher temperatures may change the strength of el ni & ntilde ; os , scientists report earth may be close to the warmest it has been in the past million years , especially in the part of the pacific ocean where potentially violent el ni & ntilde ; o weather patterns are born , climate scientists report . this doesn ' t necessarily mean there will be more frequent el ni & ntilde ; os , which can disrupt normal weather around the world . but it could mean that these wild patterns will be stronger when they occur , says dr james hansen of nasa goddard institute for space studies . the el ni & ntilde ; o phenomenon is an important factor in monitoring global warming , according to a paper by hansen and colleagues in the current issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . el ni & ntilde ; os can push temperatures higher than they might ordinarily be . this happened in 1998 when a so - called super - el ni & ntilde ; o helped to heat the earth to the highest since records began . what is significant , the scientists write , is that 2005 is in the same temperature range as 1998 , and was among the warmest year ever on record , with no sign of the warm surface water in the eastern equatorial pacific typical of an el ni & ntilde ; o . the waters of the western equatorial pacific are warmer than in the eastern equatorial pacific , and the difference in temperature between these two areas could produce greater temperature swings between the normal weather pattern and el ni & ntilde ; o , they write . they blame this phenomenon on climate change , which they say is affecting the surface of the western pacific before it affects the deeper water . el ni & ntilde ; o and climate change overall , earth is within 1 & deg ; c of its highest temperature levels in the past million years , hansen and the others write . they note a recent steep rise in average temperatures , with global surface temperatures increasing about 0 . 2 & deg ; c for each of the past three decades . many scientists attribute this rise to human activities , notably the release into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases that let in sunlight and trap its heat like the glass walls of a greenhouse . human - caused global warming influences el ni & ntilde ; os much as it sways tropical storms , the scientists write . " the effect on frequency of either phenomenon is unclear , depending on many factors , but the intensity of the most powerful events is likely to increase as greenhouse gases increase ," they write . " slowing the growth rate of greenhouse gases should diminish the probability of both super - el ni & ntilde ; os and the most intense tropical storms ." between under than after until very being too
