mice engineered to have a low body temperature live longer , scientists show lowering the body temperature of mice without limiting the amount of food they eat can prolong their lives , a new study shows . according to a study in the latest issue of the journal science , female mice live up to 20 % and males 12 % longer . " our study shows it is possible to increase life span in mice by modest but prolonged lowering of core body temperature ," says bruno conti , an associate professor at scripps research institute in california , who led the study . but it will take a long time to determine if the same applies to humans , the researchers say . scientists know that body temperature and ageing are linked in reptiles and other cold - blooded animals . they also know that the life span of warm - blooded creatures can be extended by reducing the number of calories they eat , which in turn lowers the body temperature by slowing down the metabolism . so , the researchers carried out the study to determine whether calorie reduction is indeed responsible for extending animals ' life , with a lowering of the body temperature being a secondary effect , or whether the latter is actually the cause of the increased longevity . they found that the increased life span is due to the lower body temperature , independent of the amount the mice eat . cooling down a mouse in the study , the researchers lowered the body temperature of the mice 0 . 3 - 0 . 5 & deg ; c by genetically manipulating them . they created mice that produce large amounts of a type of protein in the brain . this acts to heat up the brain ' s thermostat , a region of the hypothalamus . and the thermostat responds by reducing the core body temperature . what about humans ? professor clifford saper from the beth israel deaconess medical center says that if core body temperature is critical in extending the life spans of mammals , " one might wonder whether 37 & deg ; c is indeed the optimal body temperature for humans , and why evolution has not selected for a lower body temperature and longer life span ". but before we look at manipulating how long humans live , he says " one would certainly want to know the consequences of hypothermia before pursuing it as a way to increase life span ". ours with against most is what
