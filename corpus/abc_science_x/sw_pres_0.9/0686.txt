many people have protested over the use of animals in experiments the use of lab animals to develop new medicines , cosmetics and pesticides could be eliminated by virtual experiments on computer , say european researchers . the virtual tests could be run using computer models that draw on a vast database of information about chemical compounds . and the system could also help develop new compounds in record time , the researchers say . developing new chemical compounds consists of multiple steps , from identifying an active chemical among millions of potential leads to pinpointing a target . finding an effective chemical requires a lot of mixing and matching of compounds in the lab . but access to a centralised database of chemical candidates under development , known as chemomentum , could help researchers save some lab time , and lab animals . modelling tools available in the software could be used to optimise the chemical structure of the compound and analyse whether those changes make it interact better or worse with a potential target . once the right chemical compound is pinpointed , it needs to be tested for effectiveness as well as toxicity . classic toxicity tests are done by exposing animals to increasing doses of a chemical . at a low dose no effect is seen ; at a high dose , all animals die . the right dose is somewhere in between . based on such animal tests , the lethal dose of a chemical is extrapolated to humans . according to the british union for the abolition of vivisection , 100 million animals are used in laboratories to tests range of goods , including household products , cosmetics , food additives , pharmaceuticals , and industrial and agricultural chemicals , to name a few . mathilde romberg , a research fellow at the university of ulster in the uk and one of the principal investigators on the chemomentum project , hopes the new system can reduce those numbers . romberg has partnered with experts at eight universities , institutes and companies from france , germany , italy , estonia and switzerland to compile the system . she says the user - friendly program should " help the chemical industry and european regulatory bodies evaluate the substances and assess related risks , with fewer and fewer animal tests ." in theory , experimental tests may not be necessary with chemomentum . rather , users would input information about the leads and targets they are interested in and the system would return the corresponding toxicity predictions . the software will be designed to perform calculations using standard pcs or draw upon the computing power of pc clusters - also known as grid computing - to crunch more complex data expeditiously . at the moment , the models that predict toxicity are new and people are sceptical about using them , said paolo mazzatorta , a scientist in the chemical food safety group at nestl & eacute ; research center in lausanne , switzerland . but experimental tests are expensive and that could eventually drive more interest in predictive modelling . " i think there will come a moment when this science will be more mature and it will be used ," he says . been you because your under not on then her other don under for himself we the she now all
