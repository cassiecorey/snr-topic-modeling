this binary system regularly emits the most energetic gamma rays ever observed . the system consists of a huge star and a compact object , possibly a black hole astronomers have discovered an ' orbital clock ' in the milky way , a gamma ray source 100 , 000 times more energetic than any other . the repeated emission comes from a binary system where a compact object , possibly a small black hole , orbits a massive star about every 4 days . an international team of scientists reports its findings in the journal of astronomy and astrophysics . very high energy ( vhe ) gamma rays in this system are produced when particles are accelerated to move at close to the speed of light . this happens when particles from the strong stellar wind collide with particles from the compact object . but the process is reversed when the gamma rays meet the intense ultraviolet light radiated by the star , and are absorbed . it is the production , then absorption , of the gamma rays that is responsible for complex variations in the signal . the signal is strongest when the compact object is in front of the star and weakest when it is behind it . " this is the first time we ' ve been able to identify this orbital variation in a high energy gamma ray source and it allows us to probe to much greater depth the astrophysics of gamma ray production and absorption ," says australian co - author dr gavin rowell from the university of adelaide . neither the production nor the absorption processes are well understood . vhe gamma ray emission is rare and the object is one of just 30 such sources discovered in the past few years . it is also the only one where the intensity of the emission changes in a regular fashion . rowell says a number of factors are involved in the signal ' s periodic patterns . these include geometric effects relating to the orientation of the compact object to the star and the angle at which the system is seen from earth . " there is lots of interaction between events which leads to the flux profile we see . the rules are quite simple but separating the influences of changes in the magnetic field , the intensity of the stellar wind and mechanisms contributing to particle acceleration and absorption is difficult ," rowell says . " orbital signatures like this are useful keys . they act as a probe of the changing environment as the compact object moves along its orbit and give a useful insight into how gamma rays are produced and what happens to them ." the source was detected as part of a survey of vhe gamma ray sources in the southern sky using the most sensitive ground based gamma ray detector , the high energy spectroscopic system in namibia , southwest africa . then no to nor a myself some yours being there most then my nor does when why this the them because to how until again against these doing when
