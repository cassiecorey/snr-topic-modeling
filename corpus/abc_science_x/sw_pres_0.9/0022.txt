navigating bubble wrap : part of research that may one day help to design space exploration robots crayfish don ' t just blunder around in the dark bouncing off rocks but use a sophisticated sense of touch to form detailed mental images of their surroundings , an australian researcher says . professor david macmillan of the university of melbourne has previously piqued the interest of nasa , which has applied his earlier work on the crayfish , or yabby ( cherax destructor ), to developing tiny space exploration robots . macmillan says just as humans looking for the bathroom in the middle of the night grope around with their hands , yabbies in dark or murky waters use their antennae to orientate themselves . they also use chemosensory receptors all over their bodies that allow them to detect chemicals in the water from food , mates or predators . " we ' re trying to find out how crustaceans work out what their world is like ," he says . yabbies are not renowned for having large brains , but macmillan says his research , published in the current issue of the journal of experimental biology , shows the crustaceans have an acute sense of touch that helps them to get around . " people have made lots of assumptions that they ' re not that smart and they don ' t know what ' s going on out there but increasingly [ we ' re ] finding that they actually put together some pretty sophisticated pictures ," he says . bubble wrap or sandpaper ? in the study macmillan and colleagues put the crayfish into arenas containing different types of surfaces and structures including bubble wrap and sandpaper . " basically we asked the animals to tell us whether they could tell the difference ," he says . " what we ' re seeing is that they change their behaviour according to the texture of surfaces ." he says his team is the first to demonstrate that yabbies can discriminate between textures . crayfish in space macmillan ' s research feeds into the field of biomimetics , where designs found in nature are used in robotics . a few years ago , he travelled to the us where he met nasa scientists developing miniature , independently moving robots to discuss his work on how yabbies move their tails . macmillan has just completed more work suggesting yabbies can analyse particular spaces before they enter them , and can even recognise places they ' ve been before , and other crayfish . " we now think we ' ve got evidence that they can do very sophisticated analyses on a space before they even get into it , they can detect vibrations and they can remember what they ' ve experienced before ," he says . other me such did below or s my but themselves with your being them from with you most in that my how who any during its in was the before these t her had into most had of that
