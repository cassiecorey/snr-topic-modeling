since ancient times , people have dyed their grey hair black a 2000 - year - old recipe for hair dye shows ancient greeks and romans used nanotechnology to permanently colour grey hair black , say experts . dr philippe walter of the french state museum agency ' s centre for research and restoration and colleagues report their findings online in the journal nano letters . the researchers made up a batch of dye according to a recipe used since greco - roman times , which includes a mixture of lead oxide and slaked lime . they soaked 50 milligrams of blond human hair in the dye for three days , then studied the hair closely . the hair turned progressively black and when the researchers took cross - sections of hair and studied it under the microscope they found nanocrystals of lead sulfide inside the hair shaft . the lead in the lead oxide had reacted with sulfur from the amino acids found in hair keratins , the scientists say , giving the black colour . they say the 5 nanometre lead sulfide crystals look very much like lead sulfide quantum dots that are made today by advanced materials science methods . the researchers say their discovery might help develop new mineral - based nanomaterials . dr ivan kempson , a materials scientist and research fellow at the university of south australia , is impressed with the research . " it ' s the highest resolution and most detailed study of the incorporation of a metal like lead into hair ," he says . kempson says the findings are interesting for his own work , which looks at how hair takes up metals from the environment . but he says it is not yet clear how the sulfur in the keratin is made available to interact with the lead in the hair . kempson says the research is also of interest to the cosmetics industry in developing hair dyes . " if you know how they penetrate the hair and how they react within the hair then you can develop better cosmetic products ," he says . the research team includes a member from l ' or & eacute ; al cosmetics company . are such there having during at myself a against or before yourself don me just it a itself himself up your them through just too this with your him if does are himself their
