scientists hope to gain an insight into the secret life of clouds with australia ' s biggest climate experiment international storm chasers gathering in australia this week will release more than 1000 weather balloons over the next month as part of the nation ' s largest meteorological study . the tropical warm pool international cloud experiment , based in darwin , will provide the world ' s most comprehensive set of data about the behaviour of thunderclouds , says dr peter may , a principal research scientist at the australian bureau of meteorology in melbourne . may says the study will give scientists better ways of modelling cloud behaviour , resulting in more accurate short - term weather forecasting and better predictions for long - term climate change . " the biggest uncertainty in climate forecasts and greenhouse calculations comes down to our understanding of thunderstorms ," he says . " the underlying aim of this experiment is to increase our understanding of thunderstorms themselves , how they evolve and the large scale impact they have ." collaborators in the project include the bureau , the us department of energy atmospheric radiation measurement program , the csiro , nasa and universities from australia , the us , europe , canada and japan . measuring ice crystals may says the tropical weather conditions in darwin , which was devastated by cyclone tracy in 1974 , provide a natural laboratory for storm watchers . and this is the time of year for tropical storms , when darwin has its monsoon - like ' wet ' season . the multi - million dollar study will have three prongs . may says research planes will fly directly into the clouds to measure ice crystals while a ground - based network will use radars , laser and infrared systems to look at cloud characteristics and the movement of heat , moisture and light . and weather balloons will be released every three hours over 23 days from five sites around darwin . " this data set is going to be a real resource for the whole meteorological community ," may says . " it ' ll be the data set that people go to develop new model systems for the next 20 years . there will be dozens , if not hundreds of papers written about this experiment ." may says the link between climate change and global storm patterns is unclear . but he says it ' s unlikely that climate change is directly responsible for isolated events , like hurricane katrina that struck new orleans last year . " the question isn ' t is a particular storm due to climate change , the question is are we loading the dice so that we can expect more storms or will they be more intense ," he says . his not s our
