the latest computer virus , which arrives by email , is ready to delete your files this friday a destructive worm posing as a pornographic email may already have infected hundreds of thousands of computers and could erase many everyday files on 3 february , security experts warn . the kama sutra worm , which targets microsoft , adobe and zip files , is a threat because many users will not know the virus has infected their computers until it is too late , security experts say . they also estimate that the worm , which spreads by emailing itself to addresses in an infected computer ' s mailbox , may already have slipped onto 275 , 000 to 500 , 000 machines and is now simply waiting to obliterate files on friday . the virus , also known as grew . a or mywife , tricks users by appearing as an email attachment with subject lines such as hot movie , give me a kiss and miss lebanon 2006 . some variations refer to the ancient kama sutra guide to elaborate sexual positions to attract attention and convince victims to open the email . " it claims to be a movie or picture with some sort of sexual content ," says johannes ullrich , chief research officer at the nonprofit sans institute research group . " that is how it tricks you ." the virus causes a keyboard and mouse to freeze . it then disables anti - virus programs when the computer is restarted , leaving a machine vulnerable , says ken dunham , rapid response director at verisign corp ' s security unit idefense . the virus mainly has infected computers of vulnerable consumers and small businesses , which are far less likely to have up - to - date security software , he says . the kama sutra worm also stands out because its primary purpose is to destroy files rather than to seek financial gain or to take control of a computer , security experts say . dunham says any users who suspect they may have triggered the worm should reinstall an anti - virus program and make sure the virus has been removed . " it is already under way and will be activated unless people get removal tools ," he says . " if you have opened an email and your computer froze up , you should be very concerned ." any down all very will itself own how yourselves itself until most has your itself has am i ours am t on i
