researchers have developed a working interface between living tissue and silicon chips european researchers have ' glued ' live nerve cells onto a silicon chip and managed to get the neurones and chip to talk to each other . the technology , which used networks of rat neurones grown in culture , could lead to the creation of ' neural prostheses ' or the creation of ' organic computers ' powered by living neurones , the team says . the italian , german and swiss team says it took a lot of effort to develop a working interface between the living cells and the chip ' s inorganic compounds . " we attacked the problems using two major strategies , through the semiconductor technology and the biology ," says molecular biologist professor stefano vassanelli from the university of padua . the team , which is being funded by the european commission ' s information society technologies program , put 12 , 384 transistors and hundreds of capacitors on a 1 millimetre square chip . then the reserearchers used proteins found in the brain to ' glue ' the neurones to the chip , vassanelli says . the proteins also act as a link between the ion channels of the neurones and the semiconductors , allowing neural signals to be passed to the chip . in the opposite direction , the chip ' s capacitors stimulated the neurones , causing them to ' fire '. vassanelli says the team ' s next project is to work out how chips could communicate with genes and vice versa . " genes are where memory comes from and without them you have no memory or computation ," he says . " we want to explore a way to use genes to control the neurochip ." keeping neurones alive professor ashley craig , an australian neuroscientist with the university of technology , sydney , says linking computer circuits with brain cells can kill neurones by interfering with the brain ' s fragile chemical and electrical balance . and linking chips with genes may be an option . commenting on the european proposal , he says targeting genes instead would enable the chip to communicate with a network of cells . " genes contain the memory and knowledge of building things , growth and regrowth ," he says . " they would target a particular gene , maybe heart disease or addiction , and link it to a computer chip tucked away under your skin , and try and influence [ gene communication ]." and s other own
