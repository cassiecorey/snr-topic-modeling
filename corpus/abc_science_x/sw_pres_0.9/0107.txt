brain implants may turn sharks into underwater spies , says the us military the pentagon is funding research into neural implants with the ultimate hope of turning sharks into ' stealth spies ' capable of gliding undetected through the ocean , a report says . the research , outlined in this week ' s issue of new scientist builds on experimental work to control animals by implanting tiny electrodes in their brain , which are then stimulated to induce a behavioural response . " the pentagon hopes to exploit sharks ' natural ability to glide quietly through the water , sense delicate electrical gradients and follow chemical trails ," says the report . " by remotely guiding the sharks ' movements they hope to transform the animals into stealth spies , perhaps capable of following vessels without being spotted ." the project is being funded by the pentagon defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ). scientists involved in the scheme presented their work last week at a meeting on ocean sciences in honolulu , hawaii , the report says . a team at boston university has implanted electrodes into the brain of a spiny dogfish in a shallow tank . the implants , controlled by a small radio transmitter , stimulate either the right or left side of a brain area dedicated to smell , causing the fish to flick around in that direction in response to the signal . the next step will be to take this device outside the laboratory . blue sharks implanted with the gadget are to be released off the coast of florida . as radio signals will not penetrate the sea , communications with the fish will be made through us navy acoustic towers capable of sending sonar signals to a shark up to 300 kilometres away . other darpa - funded researchers are working on using implants to record brain activity in sharks to understand which neurons are fired by scents , electrical or magnetic fields . these signals help the fish to navigate and offer the reward of food , and could thus in theory be manipulated for surveillance work . new scientist says the darpa work is controversial , but also points out that work with animal implants also has a potential benefit for medicine . understanding more about the brain ' s electrical signals could one day result in implants to control a prosthetic limb to overcome paralysis , the report says . did them are it below own have it themselves after your out against don all themselves because yourself such
