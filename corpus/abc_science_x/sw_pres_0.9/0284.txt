given a choice , goats like the taste of truffles , onions , apples and garlic . but when faced with oranges , like these ones on the greek island of crete , they just can ' t refuse goats and sheep prefer the taste of truffles , according to a new study that shows these ruminants have a wide palate with some suprising favourite flavours . the study , published in the may issue of the journal small ruminant research , found that while sheep and goats have similar tastes , sheep have a more discriminating palate . " flavour does appear to be more important to sheep than to goats ," says australian co - author and csiro sustainable ecosystems researcher professor iain gordon . " we didn ' t test why this is the case , but it may be because goats generally have a more catholic [ varied ] diet than do sheep in the natural world , and so will eat a range of things with different flavours ." in order of preference , sheep enjoy truffle , garlic , onion , apple , caramel , maple and orange flavours , according to the new research . goats prefer truffle , onion , apple and garlic . gordon and his colleagues recruited 10 male scottish blackface sheep ( ovis aries ) and 10 male feral hybrid goats ( capra hircus ) as taste testers . the researchers treated nutritionally - enhanced food pellets with a range of synthetic , human - grade flavourings , avoiding the bitter flavours goats and sheep tend to dislike . after the animals fasted for an hour , the researchers presented basins containing the flavoured feeds for 30 minutes . by weighing each basin at the end of the taste test , the researchers determined how much food of each flavour the ruminants ate . taking the taste test both sheep and goats chowed down on the more pungent , earthy flavoured feeds , shunning strawberries . " my view regarding these flavours is that they are highly attractive , even though rare , because of health affects associated with consumption , for example anti - parasitic [ action on ] worms for garlic and onion ," says gordon . he also explains that the researchers did not give real truffles , onions and other foods associated with the flavours to the animals because they wanted to study the animals ' preferences for flavours alone , independent of nutritional content . dr alan duncan , a nutritional ecologist at the macaulay institute in aberdeen , scotland , says the flavour rankings " make sense ". " both species tended to prefer flavours they might naturally encounter , such as the fungi - type truffle flavour and the onion and garlic flavours , which are found in the wild representatives of both cultivated vegetables ," he says . " the fruity flavours tended to be avoided , and this is unsurprising since fruits do not generally feature in the repertoire of natural foods encountered by ruminant herbivores . " i was slightly surprised that sheep showed stronger preferences than goats . sheep are predominantly a grazing animal , whereas goats readily consume shrubs and woody vegetation ." now that these preferences are known , gordon and duncan suggest , the flavours might be added to feed to encourage livestock to eat , particularly when new foods are introduced . had these over was been because
