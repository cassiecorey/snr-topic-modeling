eye of the storm saturn has cooked up a sizeable storm that scientists say is the first in the solar system besides earth to feature a hurricane - like eye and well formed towers of clouds . the storm is smaller than the famed great red spot churning away on saturn ' s giant neighbour jupiter , but is still formidable . it sprawls for about two - thirds the diameter of earth across saturn ' s southern pole . " it looks like a hurricane , but it doesn ' t behave like a hurricane ," says dr andrew ingersoll , a cassini scientist at the california institute of technology in pasadena . the nasa cassini spacecraft spent three hours on 11 october observing the beast and clocked its winds at 550 kilometres per hour , twice as strong as hurricane katrina at its peak . the spacecraft also imaged a shadow cast by clouds stacked above and ringed around the south pole , as well as two spiral arms of clouds protruding from the central ring . scientists estimate the tower of clouds spans 30 - 75 kilometres above the clouds in the centre . that ' s between two and five times taller than the clouds that surround the eye of a hurricane on earth . the saturn storm can grow much taller because the planet ' s hydrogen - helium atmosphere is much less dense than earth ' s at comparable pressures . also unlike hurricanes on earth , the storm is not moving around , but appears locked at saturn ' s south pole . and with a temperature of around minus 170 & deg ; c , there is no ocean , nor warm tropical water to pump its strength . at the base of the eye , scientists can discern , but not explain , dark clouds . they do know saturn ' s south pole is warmer than the rest of the planet . " the winds decrease with height and the atmosphere is sinking , compressing and heating over the [ planet ' s ] south pole ," says dr richard achterberg of nasa ' s goddard spaceflight center . additional observations are planned as the seasons change on saturn and the south pole transitions from summer to autumn . " whatever it is , we ' re going to focus on the eye of this storm and find out why it ' s there ," ingersoll says . been more is any into until what having which ours under his to to if both
