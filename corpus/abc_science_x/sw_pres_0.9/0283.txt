benzene forms when vitamin c and a preservative combine in the can reports of benzene in soft drinks have been confirmed in australia by government authorities who say the levels pose no health risk . a spokesperson for food standards australia and new zealand ( fsanz ) says a recent study has found levels of benzene in australian soft drinks are under 10 parts per billion . " these levels are very , very low ," the spokesperson says . " five years ago we wouldn ' t even have been able to detect it ." fsanz says the main source of benzene exposure for the general population is traffic pollution , air round petrol stations , and active and passive smoking . the spokesperson says someone would need to drink more than 20 litres of a drink to consume an amount of benzene equal to the amount breathed from city air in a day . " it ' s an exceedingly small amount ," he says . " we don ' t believe it poses a health hazard ." but he says any amount of benzene in food is undesirable and fsanz is working with soft - drink manufacturers to find ways of reducing levels to a minimum . vitamin c + preservative = benzene benzene , a carcinogen , is found in the environment from natural and man - made sources . fsanz says soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and the preservative sodium benzoate ( identified as 211 ) have traces of benzene . ascorbic acid reacts with copper and iron found in water to from hydroxyl radicals and these radicals can react with benzoic acid to form low levels of benzene , says fsanz . the world health organization guideline for benzene in drinking water is 10 parts per billion and the us environmental protection agency has established a guidelines level in drinking water of 5 parts per billion . fsanz plans to release a fact sheet on benzene in soft drinks on its website within a week to 10 days . chemical mixtures dr kate hughes , a sydney - based consultant on toxics to government and other organisations , says the response from fsanz is " disappointing ". " it doesn ' t really matter whether it ' s 10 parts per billion or whatever ," says hughes , a former toxics campaigner . " the point is it ' s there and it ' s not meant to be there in a food ." she says studies by us scientists have shown that a mixture of small amounts of chemicals in the food chain affect the development of children . hughes says that it s also significant that the presence of benzene is an unanticipated reaction between a food additive and vitamin c . she says it points to the creation of something that can be more toxic than the original two chemicals . hughes says although there are now thousands of published examples of such synergistic reactions , health authorities do not generally consider them . " in the real world hazardous chemicals usually don ' t come by themselves , they usually come in mixtures ," says hughes . not them but here again theirs myself himself ourselves those out from here
