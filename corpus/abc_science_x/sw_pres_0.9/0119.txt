do you metabolise caffeine quickly or slowly ? the answer could tell you about your risk of having a heart attack a gene that controls how fast your body breaks down caffeine might explain why some people can get away with drinking lots of coffee and others can ' t , new research suggests . people with a genetic variation linked with slow caffeine metabolism are more likely to have a nonfatal heart attack , the researchers write today in the journal of the american medical association . the researchers looked at 4024 people who lived in coffee - rich costa rica between 1994 and 2004 . half had had a nonfatal heart attack , and half had not . they found that slightly more than half had the slow version of the gene while the others had the fast form . " we found in individuals who had the slow version of this gene , as little as two cups of coffee a day is associated with an increased risk of heart disease ," says study author dr ahmed el - sohemy of the university of toronto . for those with the slow - acting gene , two to three cups of coffee a day increased their odds of a heart attack by 36 %, and four or more cups a day increased the risk by 64 %, the study says . " for those who had the fast version of the gene , there was no increased risk , even with four or more cups a day ," he says . " surprisingly , what we found was that in individuals under 50 years of age who were fast metabolisers ... consumption of as little as one to three cups a day was associated with a lower risk of heart disease ." those with the fast - acting gene who drank two to three cups of coffee a day had 22 % reduced odds of having a heart attack , but drinking four or more cups a day lessened the risk by 1 %, the study found . " initially we thought that individuals who had the slow version of this gene might drink less caffeine because it stays in their system longer ," el - sohemy says . " but what we found is that regardless of the version of the gene that the person had , it did not affect how much caffeine they consumed ." breaking down caffeine in the liver the enzyme cytochrome p450 1a2 is responsible for metabolising caffeine in the liver . and variations of the gene for this enzyme can slow down or speed up caffeine metabolism . " an individual cannot predict whether or not they have the slow or fast version of the gene , because although they can feel the effects of caffeine on the nervous system , they cannot feel the effects on their blood vessels ," el - sohemy says . since tests to determine which form of the gene you carry are not readily available and you cannot feel how fast your body is getting rid of caffeine , the study ' s authors recommended reining in coffee consumption to no more than four cups a day . previous studies have offered conflicting findings about the health effects of coffee , and el - sohemy notes other chemicals in coffee may play a role . " of all the studies that have been conducted to date that looked at the effects of either coffee or caffeine on heart disease , none of them have taken into account genetic differences in the ability to break down caffeine ," el - sohemy says .
