the report likens the rock art to the palaeolithic art of western europe the largest collection of ancient rock art in the world , located in the rugged northwest of australia , should be entirely protected from industry , says a new report . the report on the archaeology and rock art in the dampier archipelago was released this week by the national trust of australia ( wa ). it fuels ongoing debate about development in the area , which is being considered for national heritage listing . robin chapple , of the national trust , says there are around a million rock carvings on the archipelago . and he says 500 , 000 of these petroglyphs are estimated to be on the burrup peninsula , where woodside energy was recently granted permission from the western australian government to begin development of a natural gas project . " it ' s basically the largest collection of rock carvings in one location ," says chapple . the report says some of the oldest of the carvings , which are tens of thousands of years old , include those of archaic faces . and there are also depictions of animals that disappeared long before europeans arrived on the continent . for example , there are carvings of thylacines , which have been extinct on the mainland for 3000 years . other evidence of prehistoric human activity on the archipelago includes food preparation sites , quarries , stone arrangements and terraces . " it ' s a bit like walking into the mary celeste ," says chapple . " you ' ve got this whole feeling like you ' re actually in someone ' s living room ." that the has if hers again once those all whom that were each will same has themselves me our what out is does if
