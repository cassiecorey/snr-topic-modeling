watching a comedy is as good for the heart as aerobic exercise , new research suggests watching a comedy film boosts the flow of blood to the heart , but watching a sad film makes the flow decline , a us study shows . university of maryland researchers asked 20 young people to watch movie segments lasting 15 to 30 minutes , taken from comedy films and serious films , with at least 48 hours between the two sessions . with the help of ultrasound , the researchers measured the study participants ' blood flow through the brachial artery . this vessel runs between the shoulder to the elbow and its blood flow is thought to be a good indicator of blood flow around the body . blood flow was reduced in 14 of the 20 volunteers when they watched extracts such as the distressful opening scenes to saving private ryan . but blood flow rose in 19 out of 20 when they watched funny clips , such as scenes from something about mary . the difference between the two flows was more than 50 %, according to the study , which appears today in the journal heart . watching a sad movie has about the same effect on heart flow as remembering an angry incident or doing mental arithmetic , it says . but watching a comedy is equivalent to a bout of aerobic exercise or starting a course of cholesterol - busting statin drugs . depression , anxiety , hostility and anger are already known to impair nitric oxide pathways that help blood vessels to dilate . the authors tentatively suggest that a chuckle may stimulate selected hormones to have the opposite effect . " positive emotions such as mirthful laughter [ may ] have a [ beneficial ] effect on the endothelium ," the cells that line the walls of the blood circulation system , they speculate . for against on
