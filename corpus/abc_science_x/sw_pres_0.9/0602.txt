a component of the micro gas - turbine engine a tiny gas - turbine engine that fits on a 20 cent piece could replace batteries that power laptops , mobile phones , radios and perhaps home generators , its developers say . the microengine is being developed by a team led by alan epstein , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the massachusetts institute of technology . he says the engine could provide five times as much power as a laptop battery for the same cost . " my laptop battery now runs my computer for about three hours before recharging . a microengine power system , engine plus fuel , with the same weight as the battery should run the laptop for 15 to 20 hours before refuelling ," says epstein . the engine works on the same principle as a jet engine . a compressor sucks in air from the outside and compresses the air . fuel injectors add fuel to the compressed air and the mixture gets ignited . epstein ' s engine will run on a variety of fuel , including kerosene , propane , ethanol , methanol or hydrogen . the hot gas produced expands rapidly to turn a turbine , which turns a coil inside a magnet to generate electricity . a jet engine has thousands of parts assembled into the few components that comprise the compressor , combustion chamber and turbine . epstein ' s microengine only has two parts : a moveable rotor and a stationary structure that together function as the compressor and combustor . and this jet engine would fit into a matchbox . the compression chamber is about the size of a pencil eraser , the fuel injectors are pen - point holes and the turbine is about the size of a 10 cent piece . manufacturing on a small scale such teeny components require a much different manufacturing process than large - scale jet engine parts . epstein and his team , like other researchers in this field , turn to the field of microelectromechanical systems , or mems , which is used to fabricate miniature devices ranging from computer chips and biological sensors to chemical processors . they etch out the parts from wafers of silicon . the etching requires incredible accuracy with little or no room for error . " they are bringing the field of mems to levels that a few years ago would have seemed impossible ," says carlos fernandez - pello , a professor of mechanical engineering at the university of california , berkeley . like a car engine pello ' s team is working on a similar micro system that works like a car engine . a bigger challenge for epstein may be getting the individual components to work as a single engine , says pello . at that tiny scale , the heat produced can spread across the whole device , causing parts to expand and not work well . but if they can find a way to insulate the combustor from the other components , a final working product would be about the size of a cigarette lighter , with the engine on top and the fuel below . " the size of that [ cigarette ] lighter is the size of two aa batteries . but the time it would give you power , it ' s potentially 100 times more ... maybe 50 or 60 hours ," says pello . such a microengine would be as safe as a pocket lighter , too , he says . how about emissions ? epstein says that his microengine will produce one - hundredth the emissions that a rechargeable laptop battery produces indirectly during the recharging stage , as it draws electricity from the grid . so far , the microengineered components have been micromachined , tested individually and assembled into the 20 cent piece - sized test engines . now the team has to add fuel and demonstrate a working engine , something epstein thinks can be accomplished within the next 12 months . these once further itself
