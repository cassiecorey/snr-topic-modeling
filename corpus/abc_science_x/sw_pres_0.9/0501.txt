the scientists removed a single cell from the embryo using a technique more commonly used in ivf labs a us biotechnology company says it has developed a way to make human embryonic stem cells without destroying the original embryo . the development , published online today in the journal nature , could dispel ethical objections to medical research using such cells . " it is possible to generate stem cells without destroying the embryo and without destroying its potential for life ," says dr robert lanza , chief scientist at advanced cell technology in massachusetts . stem cells are the body ' s master cells , available from many sources . but many experts believe the most powerful and versatile cells may be those taken from days - old embryos . scientists hope to study these cells , discover which compounds enable them to produce any kind of body tissue , and replicate that to make tailored treatments for diseases such as cancer , diabetes and parkinson ' s . lanza ' s team used a method already used in fertility treatments to remove one cell from a human embryo without harming it . the scientists then grew stem cells from that single cell . although the source embryos were not then implanted in a woman , the scientists say they could have been , with the potential to develop normally . the team used spare embryos from fertility clinics and let them grow to the 8 - to 10 - cell stage . the embryo at that stage is no longer able to divide into twins but the cells can still form any cell or tissue in the body . lanza ' s team managed to get 19 different cells to grow and got two stem - cell batches , or lines . " these cell lines were genetically normal and retained their potential to form all of the cells in the human body , including nerve , liver , blood , vascular and retinal cells that could potentially be used to treat a range of human diseases ," the researchers write . dr ronald green , a dartmouth college ethics professor who reviewed the experiment for the company , says he is unsure that opponents would accept this research immediately . but he believes they would eventually . " i think many of the opponents are going to bridle at this ," he says . " people are unprepared for scientific breakthroughs to resolve these ethical issues ." dr kathy hudson , director of the genetics and public policy center at johns hopkins university , says questions remain over the effect of the procedure on an original embryo and the long - term health of any resulting children . lanza agrees that the method should not be immediately used on people but this is worth studying . he says his company would make any stem cell lines available to scientists for free . to was again more being some before with off where for i only he all just will was had how our a
