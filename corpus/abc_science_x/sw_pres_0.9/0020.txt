and the am goes to ... dr karl , for promoting greater understanding of the application of science to daily living dr karl kruszelnicki , the man responsible for demystifying belly button lint , has been awarded an australia day honour for his work as a science communicator . dr karl ' s appointment as a member of the order of australia ( am ) is the latest in a long list of accolades for the former scientist , engineer and paediatric emergency doctor , including a 2002 ig nobel prize for his belly button lint research . kruszelnicki , who describes himself as " very mediocre as a scientist but pretty good at talking about it " says his real achievements have been in making a difference to people ' s lives . he tells the story of a woman who told him at a book signing that her son , once a high school drop - out and surf bum , decided to become a geneticist after listening to him on triple j radio . the boy got himself a phd and is working as a geneticist at harvard university today . " under circumstances like that i feel that i have done my work ," kruszelnicki says . " i used to be a medical doctor and i didn ' t realise it at the time , but the reason i was doing it was to liberate people from what ails them or to help them get to the next stage , like a conduit . " so i think that ' s what [ the am ] is for . alternately it might be for my groundbreaking work on belly fluff ." the secret history of dr karl kruszelnicki was born in sweden , across the river from elsinore where hamlet trod the corridors of his castle in shakespeare ' s play . at school he was teased for having a weird surname and he grew up to work in a variety of jobs including physicist , labourer , roadie and tv weatherman . today he ' s a popular media personality and a best - selling author . ask about the least known fact about him besides his middle name ( it ' s sven ), and he tells you that he test - drives four - wheel drives and is an avid autograph collector who has the signatures of three of the 12 moon walkers . he also subscribes to a $ 10 , 000 ( us $ 7500 ) worth of scientific literature . kruszelnicki says the most important scientific discovery is that you can ' t mix sewage with drinking water , the most over - rated is the internet and the biggest unanswered question is why the moon is larger on the horizon . the most way - out theory that may one day become reality ? that one day genetic engineering will allow us to travel through space in the form of a giant magnetic vapour cloud . " and you ' ll still be able to have sex ," he says . he ' s also learning to stand up on his malibu surfboard . obviously he ' ll be applying the most complex laws of physics to the task . " it ' s called not falling over ," he says . other australia day honours recipients include : & bull ; professor ian hickie ( am ), clinical advisor beyondblue , for service to medicine in the development of mental health initiatives & bull ; dr jeanne collison ( ao ), as a pioneer of cardiac bypass techniques through the development of the first australian heart - lung machine & bull ; dr ian brooker ( am ), for services to botany , including research leading to the identification and classification of the genus eucalyptus ; and & bull ; dr george bennett ( am ), for his work in celestial navigation and positional astronomy . doing have they after themselves up and we it under in each ours been ours with about same it both why above having this on do few some were over more
