cloning a mammoth was one of professor hwang woo - suk ' s sideline projects . but who do you call when you need tissue samples ? disgraced south korean stem cell scientist professor hwang woo - suk says he spent private donations for research to pay the russian mafia for mammoth tissues to clone extinct species . hwang , once celebrated as a national hero , was indicted in may on charges of fraud and embezzlement after prosecutors said he was the mastermind of a scheme to make it look like his team had produced stem cells through cloning human embryos . he previously told a seoul court that he spent part of more than us $ 1 million in corporate donations for " peripheral activities related to research ". " some of the money was spent in contacting the russia mafia as we tried to clone mammoths ," hwang told the court during a hearing this week . " but you can ' t say that [ on the expense claim ] so we expensed it as money for cows for experiment ." hwang previously said he obtained mammoth tissues from glaciers and tried to clone them three times but failed . prosecutors have charged hwang with fraud to secure funds and misusing us $ 2 . 9 million in state funds and private donations as well as violating bioethics laws in procuring human eggs for research . an investigation panel at seoul national university , where hwang once worked , said his team fabricated key data in the two papers on embryonic stem cells that were once heralded . misuse of state funds carries a penalty of up to 10 years in jail , while violating the bioethics laws can lead to three years ' imprisonment , prosecutors say . hwang denied any of the funds were used for anything other than research . he described extra expenses incurred when trying to secure animal ovaries in addition to paying for junior researchers ' housing and travel . " do you know how hard it is to secure four or five animal ovaries at butcher shops ? you need to keep the workers there happy ," he says . up on so ourselves themselves it being who has if do just t
