ethiopia , showing the east african rift system in the green area , and the southern end of the red sea above it the two mighty tectonic plates that form africa and arabia are slowly ripping apart , scientists report , potentially shifting the southern end of the red sea . as a result of this long - term split , the northeast of ethiopia and eritrea will be torn from the rest of africa and may eventually form a huge new sea , they say . an international team of geologists reports its study today in the journal nature . geologists from the uk , us and ethiopia monitored an earthquake and volcanic eruption in ethiopia in september 2005 . the event , in the afar desert at the southern end of the red sea , yielded only small amounts of volcanic material but was hugely significant in terms of geological movement , the geologists report . using images supplied by the european space agency ' s envisat satellite and deploying positioning sensors and seismic instruments , the geologists were able to get a rare first - hand look at the event . an 8 metre rupture developed in the ground in the afar ' s dabbahu volcanic massif over a period of just three weeks , and swiftly filled up with molten rock . the movement jostled the jigsaw puzzle that makes up the east african rift system , a y - shaped fault whose stem comprises the great rift valley and whose two branches comprise the red sea and the gulf of aden . the east african rift valley is an active divergent rift valley , one of the few areas on earth where a continent is being actively separated or rifted by the ongoing forces of plate tectonics . the rifting process has been going on for 30 million years and will take millions more to complete . the big rip of 2005 has no precedent in the era of satellite monitoring , which gave the experts this opportunity . they theorise that the well - known segmentation of continental rifts is caused by incursion of magma into the rip , rather than by step - by - step cracking of the surface crust . have that during the now few are my nor a just some t but ours after further being again over against itself was himself too if you doing you and him
