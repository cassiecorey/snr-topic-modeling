can modern technology help solve the secrets of egypt ' s ancient pyramids ? archaeologists who measured the egyptian pyramids at giza more than 100 years ago were surprisingly accurate , a review of historical surveys has shown . the paper , posted online by australia ' s queensland university of technology , reviews the major surveying projects of the pyramids cheops , chephren and mycerinus , built around 2600 bc south of what ' s now cairo . " they weren ' t that far out ; their surveys were quite diligent and systematic and we ' re getting fairly good agreement using modern technology ," says the paper ' s co - author robert webb , a lecturer in surveying in the school of urban development . but webb says laser scanning , computer modelling and other modern technology hasn ' t brought us any closer to answering one of the most intriguing questions about the pyramids . this is whether their position and measurements deliberately reflect the alignment of the planets and stars . "[ earlier surveys have found ] a very close relationship to the planet alignments and what we can measure on the ground ," he says . " but it ' s more of a theory and some people have also found while the similarities appear on the surface to be quite close , it ' s just really one of those mathematical flukes ." according to the review , the two major historical surveys of the pyramids were made in 1880 and 1925 using wire , steel tape and mahogany rods . the most recent attempts to map the pyramids have used laser scanning , gps , satellite imaging , digital technology and computer visualisation . questions of alignment the 1880 - 1882 survey by sir william flinders petrie concluded that there was no spatial connection between the distances and directions of the pyramids and anything else . but theories since then have suggested the spatial relationship of the pyramids reflected the alignment of orion ' s belt and the orbital path of mercury , mars and venus . other theories have included suggestions that the perimeter of the great pyramid , or cheops , of 36 , 525 pyramid inches is equal to the number of days in 100 years and the number of books of ancient wisdom credited to the egyptian god thoth . a pyramid inch , the basic unit used in measuring pyramids , is just a fraction over one inch . webb says initiatives like the university of chicago ' s giza plateau mapping project have revealed peculiar alignments inside the pyramids that could possibly shed more light on alignment theories . " computer visualisation of the insides of the pyramids and their chambers has the potential to really reveal some relationships we may not know about as yet ," he says . but he says that mystery still surrounds the pyramids . " in reality we will never know what inspired the ancient egyptians to position the pyramids as they did ," the paper concludes . where their over whom against the for theirs you each some under some
