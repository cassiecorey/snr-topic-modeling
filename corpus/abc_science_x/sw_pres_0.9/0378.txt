the ' fertilising effect ' of rising co2 on crops like wheat could be only half as much as previously thought increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide may be less of a boon to crop agriculture than previously thought , according to a new study plant biologist dr andrew leakey of the university of illinois at urban - champaign and colleagues report their findings in today ' s issue of the journal science . to date , ipcc scientists and others have said increased photosynthesis due to higher carbon dioxide levels could offset crop losses brought about by higher temperatures and lower soil moisture in a warmer global climate . but leakey and colleagues predict the ' fertilising effect ' of rising co2 will be only half as much as has been thought by 2050 . " what we ' re saying is the fertilisation effect of co2 will not be as good a thing as was previously thought ," says leakey . " the current predictions are over - optimistic ." the researchers say the ipcc ' s data come from old experiments on crops grown in greenhouses and shelters that don ' t properly capture real field conditions . studies using special field experiments show the actual benefit from rising co2 to world staples , such as corn , rice , sorghum , soybeans and wheat , they say . the field experiments involve free - air concentration enrichment technology experiments , in which crops are grown in a standard field , but are surrounded by special contraptions that allow co2 to be released across them to simulate increasing atmospheric concentrations . " it ' s very much more real world ," says leakey . he says unlike in glasshouse experiments , the plants receive natural light , wind , temperature , rainfall and have as much root volume as they need . the field experiments also allow for pests and diseases that are part of real world conditions . " when you do these experiments in the field under realistic simulations of future conditions we see about 50 % of the response [ to increasing co2 ] that was previously seen ," says leakey . leakey says the results are averaged from a number of field experiments involving different crops in the us , switzerland , new zealand and japan . he says good data is not available for the tropics and more research on this and on other areas , such as wheat production in australia is needed . there also needs to be more field experiments to study the impact of changing ozone , temperature and drought on agriculture , says leakey . he also says it may be possible to breed crops that are better able to make use of increasing co2 levels . at any him because he while the can how hers will him should too
