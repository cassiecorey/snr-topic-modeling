an unusual antarctic sea spider with five pairs of legs . its large proboscis is protruding towards the bottom of the picture weird spider - like creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean and use a ' straw ' to suck on their prey are baffling scientists . these sea spiders , some of which are blind , are defying scientific classification . marine zoologist dr claudia arango of the australian museum in sydney agrees they are arthropods , but which type ? she presented her research on these unusual and poorly understood animals recently at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart . " they are very weird looking animals ," says arango . for over 100 years , scientists have been puzzling over how exactly to classify sea spiders or pycnogonids . they crawl along the bottom of the sea floor , sometimes more than 6000 to 7000 metres down , where they live in the dark , feeding on slow - moving soft - bodied sponges and sea slugs . the creatures are segmented and have an exoskeleton , which makes them an arthropod , the same grouping as crustaceans , insects , centipedes and spiders . but they also have a very strange collection of features , including a unique feeding structure . " they have a proboscis that ' s like a straw that they insert into the animals and suck out the juices ," says arango . such features make it difficult to fit them into any of the known groups of arthropods . " they look like spiders , but they are not real spiders ," says arango . " it ' s been very hard to place them in a position within the tree of life ." arango has been studying the diversity and evolution of sea spiders . she has been using dna and morphology to construct a family tree , using 60 species of sea spiders from all over the world . out should once a me once t now before under until was herself no don had we through does this did each will an than been were
