the research behind the 2006 abel prize for maths explains how violin strings vibrate the world ' s most prestigious maths prize has been awarded to a swedish researcher for his work on wave patterns . professor lennart carleson of the royal institute of technology in sweden was awarded the abel prize for maths for his work on the fourier series . this says that everything from the vibration of violin strings to the spread of heat through a metal bar can be viewed as sums of simple wave patterns , oscillating sine and cosine waves . this led to the branch of maths known as harmonic analysis . he also solved the so - called corona problem , which looks at structures that show up around a disc when the disc itself is hidden . an example might be the corona of the sun seen during an eclipse , when it ' s hidden by the moon . the prize , which is awarded by the norwegian academy of science and letters , is often described as the ' nobel ' prize for maths . the prize rules say it should aim to spur interest in mathematics among children and young people . so far , all winners of the prize have been in their 70s . because our them to from she have between them yourselves which such if
