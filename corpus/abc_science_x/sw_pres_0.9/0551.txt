the celestial body now known as eris with her moon dysnomia ' xena ', the lonely rock at the edge of the solar system that caused pluto ' s downfall has now been officially named eris after the greek goddess of strife . " eris caused strife and discord by causing quarrels among people and that ' s what this one has done too ," says assistant professor mike brown , the california institute of technology researcher who discovered the object . brown ' s discovery , larger and further from the sun than pluto , set off a heated debate about what should be considered a planet . the 2500 members of the international astronomical union decided last month to downgrade pluto to a ' dwarf planet ', leaving only eight full planets in the solar system . many scientists have not accepted the change . eris , pronounced ee - ris , is also considered a dwarf planet . the most distant known solar system object from the sun , it takes 557 years to complete an orbit . unlike pluto , its orbit does not cross paths with neptune , the most distant full - sized planet . the body was dubbed 2003 ub313 after it was discovered . brown nicknamed it xena , after the television warrior princess . but he says he didn ' t consider that to be an appropriate formal name for a celestial body . " then the next one would be spock or something , and that wouldn ' t be quite so dignified ," brown says . the astronomers ' union accepted eris this week . the group also accepted brown ' s proposed name for eris ' s moon dysnomia . dysnomia is eris ' s daughter in greek mythology , and the word means lawlessness in greek . " it sounds like a disease . but in any case we all liked it ," says dr ted bowell , an astronomer at lowell observatory in arizona who heads the division of the astronomers ' union that deals with planets . brown says he plans to study eris and dysnomia further to figure out the dwarf planet ' s mass and density . greek mythology in greek mythology , eris started the trojan war after she was excluded from a wedding on mount olympus , home of the gods . to get revenge , she tossed an apple inscribed " to the most beautiful one " into the party , causing a squabble among the goddesses . paris , the prince of troy , was forced to settle the dispute by picking one goddess as most beautiful , earning the spite of the others and the ultimate defeat of his city in the trojan war . now
