laonastes is the only living representative of the otherwise extinct distomydae , a family of rodents that lived in south asia and japan a squirrel - like rodent found last year in laos has been identified as belonging to a family of rodents thought to have died out 11 million years ago , scientists says . a team of us , french and chinese researchers compared the live animal ' s skeleton to the fossils of a family of rodents that lived in asia in the early oligocene to late miocene eras . they confirm , in the latest issue of the journal science , that it belonged to the same mammalian family . when the animal was discovered , it made the headlines as biologists thought it belonged to a new family of animals , rather than just a new species of an existing family . they named it laonastes aenigmamus , or laotian rock rat . in fact it belongs to the family diatomyidae and resembles a small squirrel but is not a rat , says palaeontologist dr mary dawson , of the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . diatomyidae lived during the middle tertiary period , 34 to 11 million years ago , in southern asia , central china and japan . they were medium sized rodents and had characteristic molar teeth and jaw structure . the researchers say the rodent is an example of the ' lazarus effect ', when an organism suddenly reappears after a long gap in the fossil record . finding an animal thought to be extinct is even more exciting than discovering a new species , says dr george schaller , the wildlife conservation society biologist who stumbled across the new animal last year . the rodent is a nocturnal mammal that inhabits a remote laotian jungle , and is known to local ethnic groups who call it kha - nyou . scientist have been unable so far to see a live specimen . the only one found had been killed by hunters and was put on sale at a local market where it was spotted by conservation society researchers . so it i are as into at further s or
