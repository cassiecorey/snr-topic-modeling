the fossil child has been named selam , which means peace in ethiopia ' s official amharic language a 3 . 3 million - year - old skeleton of the earliest child ever found shows the ancient ancestor of modern humans walked upright but may also have climbed trees , scientists say . they found the well - preserved remains of a three - year - old girl of the species australopithecus afarensis , which includes the fossil skeleton known as lucy , in the dikika area of ethiopia . " it represents the earliest and most complete partial skeleton of a child ever found in the history of palaeoanthropology ," says dr zeresenay alemseged , of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig , germany . the skull , torso and upper and lower limbs , including the hand , show both human and ape - like features , the scientists report in the latest issue of the journal nature . the state of the ancient bones , found 400 kilometres northeast of the capital addis ababa , suggest she was buried in a flood , which may also have caused her death . the remains provide the first evidence of what babies of early human ancestors looked like . the nearly complete skeleton will also provide information about the child ' s height and structure . " this child will help us understand a lot about the species to which it belongs ," says alemseged , leader of the international team of scientists . " the lower part of the body , which includes the foot , the shin bone and the thigh bone clearly shows us that this species was an upright walking creature ," he says . but some of the features from the upper part of the body , including the shoulder blade and arms are more ape - like . the fingers are long and curved which suggest she might have been able to swing through trees . " the finding is the most complete hominid skeleton ever found in the world ," says alemseged . he says the fossil was older than the 3 . 2 - million - year - old remains of lucy discovered in 1974 , described by scientists as one of the world ' s greatest archaeological finds . " the new bones belong to a three - year - old girl who lived 3 . 3 million years ago , 150 , 000 years before lucy ," alemseged says . the fossil has been named selam , which means peace in ethiopia ' s official amharic language . dr simon underdown of oxford brookes university in england describes it as a massively exciting discovery of a juvenile lucy . " this tremendous fossil will make us challenge many of the ideas we have about how and why we came to walk on two feet ," he says . an analysis of the sediment in which the remains were found enabled researchers to build a picture of the type of environment in which the child lived . it was a lush area with flowing water , forests and grassland , which was also affected by volcanic eruptions . the range of habitats was suitable for hippos , crocodiles and relatives of the wildebeest . " we can see from the sediment that the region was very much characterised by a mosaic of environment that ranged from forests and woodlands near the rivers , to seasonally flooded grasslands to a flood plain that would have supported more open vegetation ," says dr jonathan wynn of the university of south florida , who dated the sediments surrounding the remains . australopithecus once thought by some to be our ancestor , a . afarensis is now widely considered to be a failed branch of the human tree , for many experts suspect the hominid was anatomically far closer to apes than humans . its brain , adjusted to its body size , was not much larger than that of a chimpanzee and although it no longer had the large canines that distinguished apes from hominids , it had relatively large chewing teeth that were still primitive . the other comparably complete infant hominid skeleton in the fossil record is that of a neanderthal child who lived less than 100 , 000 years ago . so our
