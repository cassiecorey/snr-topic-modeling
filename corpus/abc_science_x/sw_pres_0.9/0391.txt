the star shield approaches the line of sight to the parent star . at this stage , the bright starlight swamps the planet light in the telescope . but if the shield blocks most of the starlight , planets may be easier to find a huge daisy - shaped shield that would block out light from parent stars could be used to find earth - like planets in other solar systems , a us astronomer says . he and his team have designed a plastic ' starshade ' measuring 45 metres in diameter that would orbit with a trailing telescope . the shield would block out light from parent stars , which would normally swamp light reflected from their planets , to enable scientists to map planetary systems . finding other planets is very difficult because their parent stars are about 10 times brighter . " we think this is a compelling concept , particularly because it can be built today with existing technology ," says professor webster cash of the university of colorado , who outlines his proposal today in the journal nature . " we will be able to study earth - like planets tens of trillions of miles away and chemically analyse their atmospheres for signs of life ," he adds . the shield , which is known as the new worlds observer , would be launched into an orbit about 1 trillion miles from earth and then opened . three thrusters would be used to keep it steady while the telescope trailing thousands of kilometres behind follows light from distant planets as it hits the space shield . " the new worlds observer is actively being studied in academia , industry and government ," cash says . he adds that if earth - like planets exist , the starshade could find them within the next decade . one day , a ring of telescopes might be placed on the moon with a fleet of orbiting starshades , cash says . this would allow scientists to photograph distant planets . too each do into each
