will bird flu vaccines be out of date by the time they are ready for use ? the h5n1 bird flu in humans has evolved into two separate strains , a development that will complicate the search for a vaccine and the prevention of a pandemic , us researchers report . the genetic diversification of the pool of h5n1 avian influenza viruses with the potential to cause a human influenza pandemic heightens the need for careful surveillance , researchers said at the international conference on emerging infectious diseases in atlanta . " back in 2003 we only had one genetically distinct population of h5n1 with the potential to cause a human pandemic . now we have two ," says dr rebecca garten of the us centers for disease control ( cdc ), who helped to conduct the study . one of the two strains , or clades , made people sick in vietnam , cambodia and thailand in 2003 and 2004 and the second , a cousin of the first , caused the disease in people in indonesia in 2005 . two clades may share the same ancestor but are genetically distinct , as are different clades , or strains , of hiv , the team from the cdc found . " this does complicate vaccine development . but we are moving very swiftly to develop vaccines against this new group of viruses ," says dr nancy cox , chief of the cdc ' s influenza branch . the h5n1 strain of bird flu has spread across europe , africa and parts of asia and killed nearly 100 people worldwide and infected about 180 since it reemerged in 2003 . although it is difficult to catch bird flu , people can become infected if they come into close contact with infected birds . scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form that could pass easily between humans , triggering a pandemic in which millions could die . transmission from human to human ? all influenza viruses mutate easily , and h5n1 appears to be no exception . but cox says the evolution of a second clade does not move the virus closer to human - to - human transmission . " like the group one or clade one viruses , the group two or clade two viruses are not easily transmitted from person to person ," she says . " it really doesn ' t take us closer to a pandemic . it simply makes preparing for the pandemic a bit more difficult ." the us department of health and human services has already recognised the two strains and approved the development of a second h5n1 vaccine based on the second clade . several companies are working on h5n1 vaccines experimentally , although current formulations are not expected to protect very well , if at all , against any pandemic strain . a vaccine against a pandemic flu strain would have to be formulated using the actual virus passing from person to person . partial protection researchers say while vaccines were needed against different strains of the virus , a vaccination against one clade could provide partial protection against another . " we would expect the priming [ of a patient ] with a clade one [ vaccine ] could potentially reduce the severity of disease ," cox says . for their study , garten and colleagues analysed more than 300 h5n1 virus samples taken from both infected birds and people from 2003 through the northern hemisphere summer of 2005 . garten says the bird flu strains being detected in europe are generally clade two strains . your more you just t itself she the some her we s further a or how did has should how don theirs how was myself should of its few until it her after our myself or than had yours
