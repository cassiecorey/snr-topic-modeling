the newly discovered glider was an agile flyer and had pointed , sharp teeth that it used to eat insects gliding squirrel - like mammals that lived with the dinosaurs at least 130 million years ago may have conquered the skies around the same time as birds , or even earlier , scientists say . the newly discovered flyer , called volaticotherium antiquus or ancient gliding beast , extends the earliest record of gliding flight for mammals to at least 70 million years earlier than once thought . a fossil of the creature , which represents a previously unknown group of mammals , was found in rock beds in northeastern china . " it is the first fossil record of a gliding mammal in the mesozoic , in the age of the dinosaurs . previously we have had no fossil record of a mammal that had the ability of flight ," says dr jin meng , a palaeontologist at the american museum of natural history in new york . the find suggest other mammals from the mesozoic era , from 248 to 65 million years ago , could have been much more diverse than scientists think . meng and his colleagues describe the flying mammal in the journal nature . it is thought to be one of the most important discoveries of a major mammalian group since a review of mesozoic mammals by richard owen in 1871 . " this mammal is so different from what we know of mesozoic mammals . so we think it presents a new branch of early mammals ," meng says . the oldest previously known gliding mammal was a rodent . bats took to the skies with powered flight about 51 million years ago . but the new gliding mammal is not a direct ancestor of any other living mammals . small agile glider the fossil shows the newly discovered mammal weighed 450 grams , was an agile flyer and had pointed , sharp teeth that it used to eat insects . toe bones suggest it was also able to climb trees , critical for a glider to reach heights from which to take off . it had a large skin membrane from its fore to hind limbs that acted like an aerofoil during flight . there is also evidence of fur on the membrane and other parts of its body . a long tail could have acted as a rudder during flight . fossils of gliding animals are extremely rare . the scientists say the fossil record for gliding mammals is so scant because the small creatures are poorly preserved , particularly their gliding structure . " because they are small mammals and live in forests it is harder for them to be preserved as fossils ," says meng . again again be now other by hers if t have then it yourselves myself yourselves
