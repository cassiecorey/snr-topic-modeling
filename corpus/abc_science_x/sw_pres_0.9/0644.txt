this footprint was made by a two - legged dinosaur that walked along a sandy beach 165 million years ago scientists studying how emus walk have brought to life the mysterious moves of two - footed jurassic dinosaurs travelling along a long - lost beach . computer models have been developed to simulate the gait , and therefore the possible tracks , of specific dinosaurs . but live emus allow scientists to directly compare complex tracks to specific behaviours , say researchers looking at the thousands of tracks left behind 165 million years ago by dinosaurs at red gulch in northern wyoming . among the surprises they ' ve found is that tracks once interpreted as steady walking may actually be created by the animals stopping at mid - stride . another enigmatic type of track that now makes sense is where the dinosaurs appear to have crossed one leg over the other . the motion is a seemingly weird thing to do , until you watch an emu making the same sort of track , says brent breithaupt , director and curator of the university of wyoming ' s geological museum . emus , it turns out , have legs that are close together , like many dinosaurs , and tend to look around a lot as they walk , breithaupt says . this scanning behaviour causes emus to often cross the left foot over the right leg and the right foot over the left , making the same confusing pattern seen in the dinosaur tracks . " sure enough there are wonderful comparisons ," says breithaupt . " emus are our biological rosetta stone ." he presented the latest on emus as proxies for dinosaurs at the recent geological society of america in philadelphia . the search for a modern animal to act as a proxy for dinosaur tracks started , says breithaupt , because he was getting a little impatient with all the speculation about the tracks . there was too much of what he calls " prehistoric hyperbole ". so after passing on ostriches , which have only two toes , and rheas , which have three - toes but overly rambunctious personalities , emus were the best alternative . plus there was an emu ranch just across the state line in colorado . breithaupt and his team now think that the red gulch dinosaurs were probably human - sized meat eaters , or theropods , travelling along in groups . the groups may have included families , since there are juvenile and adults tracks together , implying some sort of parental care . exactly what the dinosaurs looked like , however , is a mystery because the mid - jurassic period is particularly poor in dinosaur fossils in north america . " there is virtually nothing known about dinosaurs in north america from that time ," says geologist dr erik kvale , who discovered the tracks and did a great deal of the first geological work there . " chances are there were some very gregarious behaviours of dinosaurs [ at red gulch ], but it ' s only a snapshot ." what can be said with more certainty is that the dinosaurs were walking in a very different landscape than today , says kvale . the sands beneath their feet were carbonate sands like those found in the bahamas or the florida keys , but the climate of the ancient shoreline was probably a lot drier . " the persian gulf is a better analogue ," says kvale . me yourselves your against they have were theirs some his should himself because more most same off further theirs so below while its both no
