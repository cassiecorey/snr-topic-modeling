women value a good sense of humour in a potential male partner , even if his jokes are crass . but men don ' t rate humour so highly in women , new research shows it ' s a trait often requested in lonely hearts ads and scientists have now shown that a good sense of humour is important for women , but not men , in choosing a romantic partner . a woman is even willing to overlook other shortcomings in a man if he can make her laugh , north american researchers say in the journal evolution and human behavior . " our results suggest that humour can positively affect desirability as a relationship partner but this effect is most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women ," says dr eric bressler , an assistant professor at westfield state college in massachusetts . bressler and canadian researcher dr sigal balshine , an assistant professor at mcmaster university in ontario , demonstrated in an experiment that a good sense of humour , or gsoh as it appears in personal ads , does make a difference . they showed groups of women pictures of two equally attractive men and presented autobiographical statements that were either funny or serious . after reversing the experiment and showing groups of men photographs of two women , they asked both sexes to select who they would choose as a romantic partner . the humorous people were seen as more socially adept but less trustworthy , honest and intelligent . men did not select the funny person but women did . " women chose funny men as relationship partners despite often rating them as less honest and intelligent ," the researchers say . funny men were preferred even if their humour was unsophisticated , the researchers add . does don t you each her myself out having above against in in did hers myself he further until too having a having itself himself has some himself very myself there after other
