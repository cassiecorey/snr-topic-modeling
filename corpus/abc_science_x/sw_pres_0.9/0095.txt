could the explosion be a new type of gamma - ray burst ? a new kind of cosmic explosion has been spotted in earth ' s celestial neighbourhood , scientists report . the blast seems like a gamma - ray burst , one of the most distant and powerful type of explosion known to astronomers . but when scientists first detected it with nasa ' s swift satellite on 18 february , the explosion was about 25 times closer and lasted 100 times longer than a typical gamma - ray burst . " this is totally new , totally unexpected ," says dr neil gehrels , swift ' s principal investigator . " this is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped swift could catch ." the explosion originated in a star - forming galaxy about 440 million light - years away towards the constellation aries . a light - year is about 10 trillion kilometres , the distance light travels in a year . this would be the second - closest gamma - ray burst ever detected , if indeed it is one . the burst lasted for nearly 2000 seconds , or about 33 minutes , astronomers say . most bursts last a few milliseconds to tens of seconds . the burst was also surprisingly dim . scientists at italy ' s national institute for astrophysics found hints of a budding supernova , an exploding star , when they saw the afterglow from the original explosion grow brighter in optical light . if it is a supernova , scientists will have an unprecedented view of one from start to finish . scientists will attempt observations with the hubble space telescope and chandra x - ray observatory . until so has
