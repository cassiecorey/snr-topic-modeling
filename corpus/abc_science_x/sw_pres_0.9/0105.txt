australia ' s new chief scientist is a long - term advocate of gm crops the position has been vacant for nine months . but australia now has a new chief scientist whose appointment has been met with a spectrum of responses from unqualified support to downright disappointment . dr jim peacock , the 68 - year old former chief of csiro plant industry and head of the australian academy of science , was yesterday appointed as the prime minister ' s new part - time adviser on science and technology . peacock is still finalising his contract under which he will continue his role as a senior researcher at csiro . he takes up the reins from the previous chief scientist , dr robin batterham , who resigned amidst claims that his advice to government was influenced by the interests of resource and energy giant rio tinto , a company he worked for part time . peacock says he does not anticipate his dual role will result in any conflicts of interest , but some commentators say his impartiality may be questioned nevertheless . gm advocate ? one issue is his ongoing support for genetic modification ( gm ) technology . " it think the integration of these [ gm ] technologies into our agribusiness will be essential for the future ," peacock told abc radio today . he acknowledges there are many concerns in the community about gm food and crops but hopes this will change as people understand the benefits of the technology . professor ian lowe , head of the australian conservation foundation and emeritus professor at griffith university , says it is appropriate that a distinguished scientist has taken up the role of chief scientist but foresees problems . " he ' s been a long - standing advocate of genetic technology so he ' s not going to be seen as neutral in the discussions about that issue ," says lowe . while labor welcomes the appointment the greens say they are " extremely disappointed " and see peacock ' s advocacy of gm as " highly divisive ". i all his down down an by about of such she during no itself down t yourself for not any being
