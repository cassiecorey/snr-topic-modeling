the adult female is just 7 . 9 millimetres long when sexually mature the smallest fish in the world has been found lurking in the peat wetlands of southeast asia , say scientists . dr maurice kottelat of the national university of singapore and team report their discovery online ahead of print publication in the royal society journal proceedings b . the record - busting newcomer , paedocypris progenetica , is skinny and transparent , and a distant cousin of the carp , the researchers say . the elusive fish lives in highly acid peat swamps on the indonesian island of sumatra and in the malaysian part of borneo that are threatened by forestry and agriculture . the scientists needed a special stereoscopic microscope to accurately measure the fish . the smallest adult specimen they netted was a mature female , found in sumatra , that came to just 7 . 9 millimetres from nose to tail . this makes her not only the world ' s smallest fish but also the world ' s smallest vertebrate . she nudged out the previous record holder , a marine fish of the western pacific called the dwarf goby ( trimmatom nanus ), which comes in at 8 millimetres at sexual maturity . kottelat says p . progenetica has " a very rudimentary skull ", which leaves the brain exposed . you in their here nor s again her where about further such most yourselves against are if which or yourself few it after
