the larsen ice shelf , seen here collapsing in 2002 , may be under greater threat from faster westerly winds over antarctica heat - bearing westerly winds have picked up speed in the past 50 years are likely to be contributing to the melting of antarctica ' s larsen ice shelf , say scientists . meteorologist professor john turner of the british antarctic survey says the biggest change in the wind speed occurs in the southern hemisphere summer . " the ice there [ on the ice shelf ] is melted most in summer and that is the season when the winds are increased ," says turner , who gave a keynote talk at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart this week . antarctica generally has lower temperatures and pressures than areas at more northern latitudes , like australia . this differential generates storms that take warm air south and cold air north . turner says that over the past 50 years the differential appears to have increased , and this has increased the speed of westerly winds over the southern ocean by an average of a few knots . the increase in speed means the westerlies are now blowing over the antarctic peninsula rather than around it , bringing destructive warm air onto the larsen ice shelf to the east of the peninsula , says turner . he says the pick - up in the westerlies will also influence climate elsewhere on the planet by driving the antarctic circumpolar current faster . the current shifts vast amounts of water and plays a major role in global heat transfer . beyond natural variability while the pressure and temperature differential between antarctica and more northern latitudes goes up and down in natural cycles , turner says climate models suggest recent changes are " exceptional " when compared to the past 1000 years . " what we ' ve seen over the last 50 years is larger than anything in these models ," he says . " that suggests that man is playing a part in this ." turner says an increase in the speed of westerlies ties in with the prediction of more extreme storms in a warming world . and he says models also support the idea that increasing greenhouse gases are causing the westerlies to increase , although exactly how they are doing so is not known . research on the increasing speed of westerlies and their role in melting the larsen ice shelf is due to be published soon in the journal of climate . double whammy turner says the ice shelves are very sensitive to climate change because they have ocean beneath them and air above . the warm westerlies blowing over their top and the warming oceans flowing beneath are " like a double whammy " for the ice shelves , he says . melting ice shelves in themselves don ' t affect sea level because they are already floating , but it ' s their role in holding back ice flowing from the main part of the peninsula that is in jeopardy . " if you take away these ice shelves , the danger is the ice from the interior could start flowing faster ," says turner . he says preliminary research suggests ice is already flowing off the peninsula faster than in the past . antarctica holds 90 % of the world ' s fresh water in the form of ice , says turner , and if all of this melted there would be a 65 - metre rise in sea level . the current sea level is rising at 3 millimetres per year . now too all in below and doing during or above himself down she can a under are can should should were few further is s under theirs those
