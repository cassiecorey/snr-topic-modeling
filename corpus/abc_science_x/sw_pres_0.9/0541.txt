not breathing while training with weights can increase the pressure on your eyes , potentially leading to glaucoma holding your breath while you ' re weight lifting can increase the risk of developing eye disease and potentially blindness , a study says . weight lifters who don ' t breathe while they ' re training can experience temporary increases in eye pressure that could heighten the risk of developing glaucoma , according to a study published in the archives of ophthalmology this week . researchers at the catholic university of brasilia in brazil measured the intraocular pressure of 30 men aged 18 to 40 during a bench press session . " we tested subjects performing a bench press , a popular exercise in [ gyms ]," the researchers say . a bench press is done by lying on your back on a bench and raising a bar bell above your chest . the researchers measured eye pressure while the subjects were holding their breath and compared this to when they were exhaling . the study found that eye pressure increased more if they were holding their breath than if they were breathing . according to the findings , 90 % of subjects had an increase in eye pressure when they didn ' t exhale while doing the bench presses , compared with 62 % who did . " the mean intraocular pressure increased significantly during weight lifting ," the researchers conclude . " prolonged weightlifting could be a potential risk factor for the development or progression of glaucoma ." musicians also at risk glaucoma is a condition associated with pressure on the eye . the pressure slowly destroys the optic nerve at the back of the eye , causing vision impairment and possible blindness . the researchers say the form of glaucoma relevant to weight lifters is known as normal - tension , or low - tension glaucoma . this is most common in people who experience frequent changes in eye pressure . the disease can be hard to pick up because it develops even though eye pressure is normal when it ' s measured in routine checks . it ' s also more common among people who play high - resistance wind instruments or those with asthma or intestinal or urinary tract blockages . " intermittent intraocular pressure increases during weightlifting should be suspected in patients with normal tension glaucoma who perform such exercises ," the authors conclude . once yourselves
