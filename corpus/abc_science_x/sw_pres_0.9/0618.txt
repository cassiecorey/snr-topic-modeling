one day we might be filling our cars with biodiesel produced using genetically modified organisms genetically modified microorganisms could one day make it easier and cheaper to produce biofuels , experts say . a symposium convened by the australian institute of agricultural science and technology in canberra this week will hear about future directions in biofuel technology and ways of meeting national biofuel targets . speaker leo hyde , research and development manager at dupont australia , says improving the yeasts and bacteria that turn raw biomass into fuel is a major step in reducing the use of fossil fuels . hyde says the company is developing bacteria specifically tailored to the production of butanol . like ethanol , butanol can be produced from the sugars contained in cellulose waste from crops like corn or sugar cane , and even logging waste . " we have bugs now but they ' re not efficient enough ," he says . " what we ' re working on is another bug that we believe will be far more efficient than the current process [ of producing butanol ]. " you ' d re - engineer it to make the butanol pathway more efficient . we ' ll modify pathways , how it uses energy , to improve the yield of the product you want ." what are the benefits ? phillip calais is a renewable energy consultant and former lecturer in environmental science at murdoch university , where he ' s involved in a biofuels project . he says there are benefits in using genetically modified or gm bugs in the fermentation of fuels like butanol , which he says is more " oil - like " than ethanol and mixes better with petrol , but is more difficult to produce . butane is made from a raw product that is then broken down to starch or sugars , fermented and purified . " with butanol , fermentation has to be very pure . if there are any weird strains of bacteria it really upsets the fermentation process ," he says . the bugs that are currently used are also destroyed once butanol reaches a certain concentration , which means more costly and time consuming processing is needed to purify it after fermentation . " by using gm you can actually breed up different bugs that can survive a higher concentration of purity in the butanol ," calais says . " if you can make it more concentrated in the first place by using better bugs you can do less processing later ." what about the risks ? the use of gm organisms holds promise for " certain niches ", says adrian lake founder and president of the biodiesel association of australia . but he says the technology is still being developed and has potential risks . " there ' s potential danger in changing any bugs ," he says . " if it ' s an organism that ' s extremely aggressive and has to be highly controlled because it will replicate and damage other organisms , that ' s a concern ." out where off theirs through only
