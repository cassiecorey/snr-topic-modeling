honey bees stick out their proboscis when they smell explosives . so could they do sniffer dogs out of a job ? bees have been trained to sniff out explosives in a project scientists say could have far - reaching applications for security and the iraq war . scientists at a us weapons laboratory say they trained honey bees to stick out their proboscis , the tube they use to feed on nectar , when they smell explosives in anything from cars and roadside bombs to belts similar to those used by suicide bombers . researchers at the los alamos national laboratory have dubbed their research the stealthy insect sensor project . they trained bees to recognise substances by exposing them to the odour of explosives followed by a sugar water reward . among the substances they can sniff are dynamite and c - 4 plastic explosives to the howitzer propellant grains used in improvised explosive devices in iraq . " when bees detect the presence of explosives , they simply stick their proboscis out ," says research scientist tim haarmann . " you don ' t have to be an expert in animal behaviour to understand it as there is no ambiguity ." the findings followed 18 months of research at the los alamos facility , the nation ' s leading nuclear weapons laboratory . " we are very excited at the success of our research as it could have far - reaching implications for both defence and homeland security ," haarmann says . while scientists have trained wasps to respond to the trace of explosives , haarmann says research with bees appeared to show more promise . haarmann says the bees could be carried in hand - held detectors the size of a shoe box , and could be used to sniff out explosives in airports , roadside security checks , or even placed in robot bomb disposal equipment . he says the next step would be to manufacture the bee boxes and train security guards in their use . " it would be great to start saving some lives with this ," he says . was over no did i where its nor yourselves most into were over no themselves was between myself they under from themselves nor if
