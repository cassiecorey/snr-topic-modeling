the epicentre of the 7 . 2 - magnitude quake , south of the indonesian island of java at least 105 people were killed when an undersea earthquake unleashed huge waves on the indonesian island of java , echoing the devastating 2004 asian tsunami , the red cross said today . after a strong 7 . 2 - magnitude quake convulsed the seabed off java ' s south coast , waves up to 3 metres high wrecked buildings and sent boats crashing ashore , prompting thousands of residents to flee in panic . tsunami alerts were issued for parts of indonesia and australia , but they did not reach the victims , as there was no early warning system working in the disaster zone , according to an official at the geophysics agency in the capital jakarta . " there are 105 people dead from 10 regencies , 148 people are injured and 127 still missing ," says putu suryawan , the official at the indonesian red cross disaster centre , adding that 2875 people had been displaced from their homes . " possibly this number could rise because many people are still missing ." at least five aftershocks rattled the area after the quake , which hit around 3 : 19 pm local time on monday ( 08 : 19 utc ), with the epicentre in the sea off pangandaran southeast of jakarta , according to indonesia ' s seismology centre . indonesia was the nation hardest hit by the devastating december 2004 indian ocean tsunami , which killed around 220 , 000 people across the region . " we still don ' t have a tsunami early warning system in place ," says an official at the geophysics agency in jakarta . indonesia ' s 17 , 000 islands sit on the pacific ' ring of fire ', where the meeting of continental plates causes high volcanic and seismic activity . both the pacific tsunami warning center in hawaii and the japan meteorological agency issued tsunami alerts for parts of indonesia and australia after the quake hit . a tsunami warning was also issued by local authorities for india ' s nicobar islands , but no immediate damage was reported there or in australia . police on christmas island , an australian territory south of indonesia , say there was no damage there . being during most themselves further me up down she i because most it have itself my why no ours down
