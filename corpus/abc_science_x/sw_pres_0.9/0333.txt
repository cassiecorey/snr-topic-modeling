the crab nebula with a central pulsar surrounded by rings of high - energy particles an astrophysicist who helped first identify pulsars and mentored many of australia ' s radio astronomers has been honoured in the queen ' s birthday honours list . professor phillip ( pip ) hamilton , deputy vice - chancellor ( research ) at deakin university , will today be honoured for his contribution to radioastronomy and tertiary education . pulsars are collapsed stars that can emit regular pulses of radio waves several times a second and were discovered just as hamilton was completing his phd in 1969 . he says at the time , pulsars were dubbed ' lgm 1 '. " lgm stands for ' little green men ' because [ the pulsing signal ] looked like something that was very , very regular ," he says . " it had to be artificial , didn ' t it , because no one had ever seen these things before ." but after four or five pulsars had been found , hamilton says the ' little green men ' theory didn ' t hold up anymore . and today there are about five or six hundred known pulsars . hamilton spent 20 years studying pulsars and recalls one occasion where he was involved with a team using the parkes telescope to take a second look at a suspicious sighting made by another telescope . " we actually discovered this pulsar , a very interesting object , in the middle of a thunderstorm ," he says . " that ' s very exciting stuff ." hamilton describes himself as " half engineer " and has had major involvement in designing several telescope control systems including that at parkes and the radio telescopes of the university of tasmania . " i ' m a hands - on person . if something breaks down in the office i ' m there before anybody else with a screwdriver in the hand ," he says . should further not nor so hers myself s been both
