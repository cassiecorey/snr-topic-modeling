the near - earth object known as 2004 vd17 may give earth its closest shave , but not until 2102 when the risk of hitting the planet is one in 1000 a space rock capable of sub - continent scale devastation has about a one in 1000 risk of colliding with earth early next century , the highest of any known asteroid , watchers say . the rock , 2004 vd17 , is about 500 metres long and has a mass of nearly a billion tonnes . if it were to hit earth , it would deliver 10 , 000 megatonnes of energy , equivalent to all the world ' s nuclear weapons . vd17 was spotted in late november 2004 and was swiftly identified as a rock that potentially crosses earth ' s orbit . at the time watchers gave it one in 3000 risk of collision on 4 may 2102 . further observations and calculations have prompted the risk on that day to be upgraded to " a bit less than 1 in 1000 ", says nasa near - earth object ( neo ) expert dr david morrison . " the risk of an impact within the next century [ is ] higher than that of any other known asteroid ," he says , stressing however that the likelihood of a hit is small . " fortunately , it is nearly a century before the close pass from vd17 . this should provide ample time to refine the orbit and , most probably , determine that the asteroid will miss the earth ." vd17 was previously categorised as a grade green , which means merits careful watching , on the torino scale of neo hazards . but it has been upgraded to grade yellow , meaning meriting attention . there are two more grades beyond this , orange or close encounter , and red or collision is certain , involving objects capable of inflicting regional or global devastation . the asteroid ' s closest proximity to earth on the 2102 flyby was not given by morrison or the hazard list maintained by nasa and the us jet propulsion laboratory . biggest threat ? vd17 ' s place at the top of the list was briefly snatched in december 2004 by a rock called 99942 apophis . further observations , however , downgraded apophis ' risk to a one in 5000 chance of collision , making it a grade green risk . apophis , measuring 300 metres across and with a mass of less than 100 million tonnes , will fly by at a distance of 36 , 350 kilometres from the earth ' s surface on 13 april 2029 . this is slightly higher than the altitude of geosynchronous satellites , according to the website of the international astronomical union ' s minor planet center . but any do being above there most am some from the
