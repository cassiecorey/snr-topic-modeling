the active ingredient in magic mushrooms produces spiritual experiences identical to those reported through history the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms produces a spiritual experience that can have lasting positive effects , a trial has shown . the ingredient , psilocybin , increases wellbeing and satisfaction with life two months after being taken , according to the research by scientists at johns hopkins medical institutions , which is published online today in the journal psychopharmacology . psilocybin is a plant alkaloid that affects the brain ' s serotonin system , in particular , the 5 - ht2a receptor . " under very defined conditions , with careful preparation , you can safely and fairly reliably occasion what ' s called a primary mystical experience that may lead to positive changes in a person ," study leader professor roland griffiths says . australian professor of psychopharmacology at the university of sydney , ian mcgregor , says he isn ' t surprised that the study confirms the ability of psilocybin to induce a spiritual state . " psilocybin and related hallucinogens have been used since ancient times in religious rituals and this study is really formalising ... what many people already know ," he says . but he says the apparent long - term benefit of the drug is " remarkable ". " to see a positive effect two months later is quite striking ," he says . however , the study also reports that about a third of the volunteers experienced fear and anxiety after taking the psilocybin and mcgregor says it should be avoided by anyone with schizophrenia or other psychotic illnesses . first study of its kind in four decades in what is described as the first scientifically rigorous study of its kind in 40 years , 36 volunteers were given either psilocybin or a comparator drug methylphenidate hydrochloride . subjects were asked to describe their experiences immediately after the session in a set of detailed psychological questionnaires and at a two - month follow up . more than 60 % of subjects ( 22 ) described the effects of psilocybin in ways that met criteria for a full mystical experience according to established psychological scales , compared to only 4 of the 36 after the comparator drug . after two months , two - thirds rated the experience as either the singly most spiritually significant in their lives or rated it among their top five . the god spot ? professor john bradshaw , an australian neuropsychologist from monash university , says the brain ' s medial temporal lobe is rich in serotonin receptors and has previously been described as the ' god spot ' because it is active in transcendental states . in a commentary accompanying the article , professsor david nichols of the purdue university school of pharmacy says it ' s likely that psilocybin triggers the same neurological process that produces religious experiences during fasting , meditation , sleep deprivation or near - death experiences . he says the current research adds to the emerging field known as neurotheology , or the neurology of religious experience , and could shed light on the " molecular alterations in the brain that underlie religious and mystical experiences ". their will and that into do than such should herself no you our being which were your themselves
