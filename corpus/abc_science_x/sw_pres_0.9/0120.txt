are you looking at me ? more australian racehorses have vision - threatening eye disease than expected , a new study shows . about one in 13 thoroughbred horses examined may be in danger of losing their sight . cataracts , corneal scarring and lesions are among the serious conditions that two veterinarians report in the latest issue of the journal veterinary ophthalmology . dr simon hurn and colleague dr andrew turner say there is a perception in the racing industry that eye disease in horses is not very common . but they had noticed a higher than acceptable level of eye disease in performance horses and were concerned . when they couldn ' t find data to compare what they had found , they decided to carry out their own research . they conducted ophthalmic examinations on 204 flat - racing and jump - racing horses at four metropolitan and two country racing stable complexes in victoria . they found potential vision - threatening eye disease in 7 . 4 % of the horses and non - vision threatening disease in 57 . 4 %. generally horses ' eyesight is on par with that of humans , the researchers say . " they probably don ' t have the same colour spectral type vision that we have but they do see colour and they do see movement . and because they move at speed , we can also assume they have good visual acuity [ sharpness ] as well ," says hurn . he adds that many of the eye findings were ' incidental ' and wouldn ' t affect horses ' vision . " horses don ' t have to read newspapers or drive cars . most of their time is spent eating or watching out for what they think are predators ," he says . " they can do that just fine with that vision that they have and the reason they don ' t have the same type of colour vision that we have is that they just don ' t need it . their eyesight is [ good ] for their environment ." hurn says while there may well be a genetic component to the eye diseases in general , he also believes vets are getting better at diagnosing eye disease . " we noticed a higher than normal incidence of cataracts in the population of horses , [ however ] and this could certainly have a genetic component ," he says . me in having been below up having
