supermarket databases could be vulnerable to virus attacks , causing chaos at the checkout cheap radio chips that are replacing the ubiquitous barcode are a threat to privacy and susceptible to computer viruses , scientists say . and a deliberate virus attack could potentially cause chaos at airports and supermarkets . researchers at amsterdam ' s free university created a radio frequency identity ( rfid ) chip infected with a virus to prove that rfid systems are vulnerable despite their extremely low memory capacity . the problem is that an infected rfid tag , which is read wirelessly when it passes through a scanning gate , can upset the database that processes the information on the chip , say the study authors . " everyone working on rfid technology has tacitly assumed that the mere act of scanning an rfid tag cannot modify back - end software and certainly not in a malicious way . unfortunately , they are wrong ," they say . " an rfid tag can be infected with a virus and this virus can infect the back - end database used by the rfid software . from there it can be easily spread to other rfid tags ." as a result , they say , it is possible that criminals or militants could use an infected rfid tag to upset airline baggage handling systems with potentially devastating consequences . the same technology could also be used to wreak havoc with the databases used by supermarkets . " this is intended as a wake - up call . we ask the rfid industry to design systems that are secure ," says author professor andrew tanenbaum . with rfid , anything from shampoo bottles to marathon runners can be tracked using radio tags . civil liberty groups say rfid could lead to an unacceptable invasion of privacy and argue that airline ticket information could be used by law enforcement agencies and divorce lawyers . industries in which tracking goods is crucial such as pharmaceuticals , governments , logistics , airlines and manufacturing already use rfid technology . their am nor
