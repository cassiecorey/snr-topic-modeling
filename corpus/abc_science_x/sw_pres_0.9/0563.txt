flying foxes reportedly flew away from the storm , probably in response to rapidly dropping air pressure cyclone larry , which hit australia ' s northeast in march , has scattered 10 , 000 flying foxes far and wide , says a zoologist . and csiro ' s dr louise shilton needs to find this local species of crow - sized , fruit - eating bat quickly . the event is both good and bad for her ongoing project to monitor the usually poorly distributed animals . it ' s bad news because it ' s rather difficult to study animals you can ' t find . " we need to be providing the best possible population data and we can ' t monitor them without knowing where they roost ," says shilton . among her questions are what they are eating and where they have chosen to roost . the good news is that when she finds them , she ' ll probably be able to learn what these animals regard as good habitat , a matter of debate at the moment , she says . do they really depend solely on undisturbed forest or do they like urban areas where fruit trees are irrigated and predators are few ? it ' s the sort of thing people who love , and those who loathe , flying foxes want to know . " there ' s this kind of love - hate relationship with fruit bats in australia ," says shilton . some people adore them and point to evidence that flying foxes play a critical role in pollinating and spreading the seeds of native plants . others are less enthusiastic . " they do come into contact with fruit growers ," says shilton . " but they also come into conflict with people in urban environments ." that ' s because the bats congregate in large noisy crowds and produce foul - smelling guano . the animosity was bad enough that it was once common for people to shoot flying foxes . now , however , the local northern queensland species is protected and a permit is required to kill them . " this particular species is the one with the smallest distribution and it is believed to have the smallest population ," shilton says . scattered or killed ? shilton is pretty certain the bats were scattered rather than killed by the cyclone , because she visited known roosting sites and found few dead animals , " just a handful compared to the 10 , 000 that had been around before the storm ". and some people reported seeing the bats hurrying away en masse before the storm arrived , probably a natural response to quickly dropping air pressure . " i would agree that queensland probably does offer more places for the flying foxes to escape the storm ," says dr kim mcconkey , a wildlife researcher who studied the effects of another cyclone on another species of flying foxes in tonga . " we recorded an 80 % decline in flying fox abundance in tonga after the cyclone , and this was almost certainly due to mortality , either directly during the storm or afterwards due to a lack of food " and human hunting , she adds . mcconkey ' s colleagues also reported seeing bat carcasses in the lagoon after the island cyclone , she says . out in daylight to find out where the queensland bats are , shilton has asked the public to call her with information . already , she says , there are sightings of flying foxes heading out for food in daylight , an unusual behaviour for the nocturnal animal . that information alone suggests some bats are finding food scarce and working harder to get a meal . meanwhile , says shilton , anyone cheering at the flying foxes ' disappearance shouldn ' t assume they have disappeared for good . " i ' ve personally got no doubt that once the native trees come into season the bats will come back ," shilton says . only very not should each any then or how than more over of most should too only
