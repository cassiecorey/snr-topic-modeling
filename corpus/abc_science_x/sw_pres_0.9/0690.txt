scientists say they can genetically engineer cotton plants to remove a toxic compound , making cottonseed fit for humans to eat scientists say they have found a way of using the cotton plant to feed potentially half a billion people a year . texas a & m university plant biotechnologist associate professor keerti rathore and colleagues report they have genetically altered the plant to reduce the levels of the toxic chemical gossypol in cottonseed , making it fit for humans to eat . " it actually tastes pretty good . it reminds me of chickpea . it ' s a fairly good - tasting seed ," he says . " it tasted better than soybean , i can tell you that ," adds rathore , who publishes the team ' s research in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the protein - rich , gm cottonseed could be ground into a flour and made into bread and other foods , he says . rathore and his team turned to a technique also being used in cancer and aids research . they used so - called rnai or rna interference technology that can ' silence ' a gene to cut the amount of gossypol in the cottonseed . when humans eat gossypol it can damage their heart and liver . the researchers left gossypol intact in the rest of the plant because it guards against insects and disease . " so the trick is not to affect the levels of these compounds in the rest of the plant , but eliminate it from the seed only . and that ' s what we have done ," rathore says . this cottonseed could serve as a high - protein food for the world ' s hungry , and falls well within the criteria set by the world health organization and us food and drug administration for food consumption , the researchers say . " potentially , if all of the cottonseed today which is produced can be utilised for human nutrition directly , it can meet the protein requirements of 500 million people on an annual basis ," rathore says . wasted protein " that is a lot of protein right now really being wasted ," he adds , noting that cottonseed often is fed to cattle because bacteria in their stomachs can break down gossypol . the chemical is present naturally within the glands in the above - ground parts of the cotton plant . for millennia , people have spun cotton fibres into clothing and other fabrics . but for each kilogram of cotton fibre , the plant produces 1 . 6 kilograms of seed , rathore says . cotton is grown in more than 80 countries worldwide . with the exception of the us and australia , he says , it is grown primarily in developing countries . researchers estimate that it will take at least another decade to develop cotton varieties with these qualities for broad commercial production . in the 1950s and 1960s , agricultural scientists bred cotton varieties that had no gossypol glands . but they were a commercial flop because the absence of the toxin made the plants too vulnerable to insects and disease . in addition to edible cottonseed , the rnai technique might be applied to other crops with toxic components , such as fava beans , to increase their use , the researchers say . too
