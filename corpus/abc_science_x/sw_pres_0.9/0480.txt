local maize ( left ) and introduced variety ( right ) from baucau , east timor ' s second largest city looting and security threats during recent civil unrest haven ' t deterred an initiative that ' s helping east timorese farmers increase their crop yield . the australian government - funded seeds of life ( sol ) program aims to improve crop yield and resistance to pests and disease through the use of improved varieties of five staple crops : maize , cassava , sweet potato , rice and peanuts . early results have been encouraging , staff say , with a 50 % increase in grain yields on research station trials and on farmers ' fields . months earlier , civil unrest in the capital dili , including the looting of the sol office by people queuing for rice , threatened to slow the program . "[ but ] nothing stops the planting of crops ," says alex dalley , the program ' s research and extension officer . dalley says despite a number of timorese nationals working on the program losing family members in the violence , and other staff members being forced to move from the capital due to threats and lack of security , it is business as usual for the program . "[ we ' re ] working full days and farming is carrying on in the districts . due to the good geographic spread of the program , all the staff have been able to continue their work in areas of the country which they feel comfortable in ," dalley says . food insecurity is a major issue in east timor . it affects an estimated 64 % of the population , with many rural households experiencing food shortages from november to february . food insecurity is partly the result of low levels of food production , a consequence of poor land and the generally low levels of technology , combined with high crop losses , both pre - and post - harvest . sol ' s work is a mix of research training , trialling with farmers , setting up research stations and applying social / economic research . as in during
