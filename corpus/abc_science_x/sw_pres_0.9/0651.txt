a shuttle mission in 2008 will be the hubble space telescope ' s final service call the us space agency says it will launch a final space shuttle mission to keep the ageing hubble space telescope in orbit and operational . the decision , announced this week by nasa chief dr michael griffin , follows a review of safety concerns and appeals from the scientific community to extend hubble ' s life . without a repair mission , which will probably be carried out in 2008 , the telescope would shut down in 2009 or even earlier . since it was launched into orbit 16 years ago , the telescope has helped astrophysicists peer deep into the universe , free of the distortions from the earth ' s atmosphere . orbiting 575 kilometres above the earth , the hubble has enabled scientists to better measure the age and origins of the universe , observe distant supernovas , and identify and study bodies in and outside the solar system . in 2004 , it conveyed pictures of the most distant parts of the universe ever observed by visible light , " the deepest portrait of the visible universe ever achieved by humankind ", says the space telescope science institute . nasa had scheduled a mission for hubble in 2003 , but scrapped it after the columbia shuttle disintegrated while returning to earth . the accident raised serious safety questions for nasa , particularly with the shuttle ' s heat shield . this week ' s announcement comes after two of the last three shuttle missions were judged a success . safety review griffin says the decision to go ahead was taken after a painstaking review of safety issues . " we ' re not going to risk a crew in order to do a hubble mission ," he told staff at the goddard space center . nasa has said previously it was ready to refurbish the telescope as long as the mission did not put the space shuttle crew in jeopardy . the hubble mission presents a challenge because the shuttle crew would not be able to seek refuge aboard the orbiting international space station if a serious problem arose . nasa also is faced with a busy schedule of another 15 missions to finish building the space station before retiring the entire shuttle program in 2010 , or four missions a year . a hubble mission would probably be set for early 2008 and would require a second shuttle to be ready for any rescue mission should the crew face an emergency . a new mission to the hubble would replace the telescope ' s six stabilising gyroscopes and its batteries to extend its life . astronauts would also repair an infrared spectrometer that has been broken since 2004 . they would also install two new instruments , including the wide field camera 3 that would enhance images of dark matter and of the first galaxies that were formed after the big bang . ourselves other
