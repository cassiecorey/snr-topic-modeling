fossils found on new zealand ' s south island belong to an ancient mammal lineage palaeontologists have found remains of one of the most primitive type of land mammal in the world , a mouse - sized creature that ' s unlike any mammal alive today . the find , at the edge of a swampy lake on new zealand ' s south island , not only fills a gap of the nation ' s fossil record , it may also help us understand more about the origin of mammals worldwide . researchers , led by trevor worthy from australia ' s university of adelaide , publish their results today online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . many types of mammals evolved in the mesozoic period when the dinosaurs dominated , says co - author alan tennyson , a palaeontologist from the museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa . but most of those early lineages are now extinct and mammals living today fall into only one of three groups : placentals , marsupials or monotremes . but this latest find , in sediments deposited 16 - 19 million years ago , doesn ' t fit into any of these groups . " this is an incredible find . we never expected to find anything like this ," says tennyson . " what ' s so exciting about this fossil mammal is that it is from one of those ancient lineages that we thought had become extinct much earlier . this will help us understand more about the origin of mammals worldwide ," he says . the find is particularly significant for new zealand as there are virtually no fossils of terrestrial vertebrates between 65 million years ago , when an asteroid impact is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs , and about 1 million years ago . in other parts of the world many different mammals evolved to replace dinosaurs as the dominant species . but in new zealand the only terrestrial vertebrates that seemed to have evolved were reptiles , frogs , and birds - not mammals . that ' s despite the fact that new zealand ' s landmass separated from gondwana after many mammals had evolved . " the suggestion has been that giant birds , like the extinct haast eagle and the moa , filled the ecological niches that mammals like tigers and grazing animals did elsewhere ," says tennyson . " but this is a very primitive mammal and it ' s unlikely to have lived here for 60 million years without diversification . so it opens the possibility that there may be bigger mammals to be found ." the researchers say the discovery implies the existence of one or more ' ghost lineages ' and suggests that mammals may have existed on new zealand more than 125 million years ago . that may contradict an alternative theory for the lack of fossil evidence for terrestrial mammals : that new zealand was completely submerged about 25 million years ago and that all of its animals and plants arrived from nearby landmasses . but the paper suggests that the discovery , along with other mesozoic survivors such as the lizard - like tuatara and new zealand ' s primitive frogs , confirms that at least some land remained above water throughout the period . not because into for once once again very are were themselves under same myself she before other at just by too how more your whom hers
