the way we relate to family members is culturally determined . but is this also reflected in brain activity ? the culture you are born into influences the way your brain works , an australian conference has heard . juan dominguez , a phd student at the university of melbourne , discussed the effects of ' enculturation ' on the human brain at a recent anthropology conference in cairns . the researcher believes different cultures produce different brains and that cultural differences reflect different neurological functioning . " in certain societies and cultures there are certain patterns of behaviour , people may make certain evaluations , have certain opinions , there are certain tasks that are culturally specific ," he says . " we should be able to find that ... the brain would have some sort of bias acquired through exposure to culture ." dominguez is piloting a brain scanning study in which he will test how people from different cultures react when they are shown photos of family members . he believes the differing kinship relations will be reflected in different types of brain activity . dr douglas lewis , a senior lecturer at anthropology who is supervising the work , acknowledges this is a controversial area . but lewis says there is no suggestion that one culture is " smarter " or " better " than another . rather , the emerging science of neuroanthropology suggests that brains within a group can be ' wired ' by common experience , just as individual brains become ' wired ' by individual experiences . " what we ' re looking for are correlates in the brain that anthropologists have in the past thought of as being cultural or culturally mediated ," he says . recognising faces the study will test brain function in an indian tamil and an australian of anglo - saxon descent . he says while western cultures call both maternal and paternal uncles ' uncle ', other cultures , including tamil , call paternal uncles ' father ' and reserve ' uncle ' for maternal uncles . " you may have a distant relationship with your father [ and ] a closer relationship with your uncle ," dominguez says . " this could bias the way in which the way brain develops because the parts that modulate emotions may be engaged in certain ways ." he ' ll test this by showing the subjects photographs of relations and monitoring their brain activity with magnetic resonance imaging . " we think that there will be patterns of activity that will be different ," he says . how does experience shape our brain ? dominguez says the human brain is ' plastic ' and responds to its environment in the way connections form between brain cells . these connections are influenced by repeated patterns of thought , emotional reinforcement and even the influence of chemicals associated with stress and pleasure on the brain . " the brain is an experience acquisition device that goes beyond genetic constraints ," he says . " it is always engaged in generating and pruning connections ." lewis says the constant process of wiring and rewiring makes every brain unique . " the number of potential connections between neurones in the neocortex alone exceeds the number of atoms in the physical universe ," he says . " that means there are potentially that many brains ... and we ' re looking at certain groups or clusters ." the principle can apply to peer groups and sub - cultures as well . " if you ' re hanging out with the hip - hop scene ... you ' re going to pick up patterns of thought , ways of thinking , expectations of other people ' s behaviour that are different from your next door neighbour who ' s a retired factory worker ," he says . how through this then that here don up did him my my those yourselves each being more me who did than the same few of should nor any with
