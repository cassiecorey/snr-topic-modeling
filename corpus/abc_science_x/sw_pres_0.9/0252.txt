saturn ' s gassy nature makes its difficult for scientists to ' see ' the length of a day saturn is spinning slower than expected , scientists report . an international team of researchers has calculated the rotation period is 10 hours and 47 minutes . that ' s 8 minutes longer than estimates from the nasa voyager results in the early 1980s . it may not sound like a lot but the researchers say it could affect how we calculate the size of the planet ' s rock and ice core , and provide more insights into how it formed . the team publishes its results today in the journal nature . " making this measurement has been one of the team ' s most important scientific goals ," says professor michele dougherty , of imperial college london . astronomers have long tried to calculate the length of a saturn day . william herschel back in the late 18th century for example , suggested it lasted about 10 hours . but the nature of saturn itself makes measurements difficult . unlike earth which has a rocky surface , saturn is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium gases , which complicates how scientists measure the length of a day . so rather than take direct measurements , scientists use proxies , or markers , of the planet ' s rotational period . in the 1980s , scientists analysed radio signals from saturn picked up by voyager to calculate the length of day . now , dougherty and us scientists used an instrument called a magnetometer on the cassini spacecraft , which measures the planet ' s magnetic field . by analysing data collected by cassini they found a clear period in the planet ' s magnetic field that they suggest indicates a day lasts 10 hours , 47 minutes and 6 seconds , give or take 40 seconds . " the period we found from the magnetic field measurements has remained constant since cassini entered orbit almost two years ago , while radio measurements since the voyager era have shown large variability ," says dr giacomo giampieri , the lead author of the study from nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory . " by measuring the magnetic field over the rest of the mission , we will be able to solve this puzzle ." and those and their in what should itself these themselves his been been out don just me on
