you ' re more open to suggestion with a cup of coffee in your hand , research shows if you want to bring someone around to your way of thinking you should make sure they ' ve got a cup of coffee in their hand , according to research showing that caffeine makes us more open to persuasion . the australian researchers say a caffeine hit improves our ability to process information and increases the extent to which we listen to and take on board a persuasive message . they tested this by quizzing people about their attitudes to voluntary euthanasia and abortion before and after either the equivalent of about two cups of coffee or a placebo . they were also given a persuasive argument to read after having the caffeine . the experiments showed that " caffeine increases persuasion through instigating systematic processing of the message ". but caffeine also puts people in a better mood , which makes them more likely to agree with a message , the researchers say . the research is posted on the queensland university of technology website and is submitted for publication in the european journal of social psychology . what does this mean for advertising ? co - author dr blake mckimmie says the research suggests that caffeine increases our ability to scrutinise the content of a message . the study has implications for advertisers , he says , because it suggests that they should schedule adverts for times when people are likely to be consuming caffeine , such as breakfast time . drinking too much coffee , however , means we ' re more likely to be distracted by peripheral factors , rather than the strength of the argument . " so if you ' re looking at an advertisement you may be more distracted by the attractiveness of the person selling it than the actual product ," he says . caffeine on the brain associate professor pradeep nathan of monash university , an expert in behavioural neuroscience who was not involved in the research , says caffeine stimulates the central nervous system including the brain , where it affects several neurotransmitters . the melbourne - based researcher says it improves memory and makes us pay closer attention to tasks at hand . " it does improve attention and it can improve memory so by being more attentive and remembering your attitude to a particular thing may change ," he says . " if you ' re more attentive , yes [ it does have implications for advertising ]. advertising works on the principle of getting people ' s attention , you want to get as many people interested in your ads as possible ." but will it last ? geoff kelly is the chief executive officer of an australian consultancy that advises governments and corporations on how to get people to buy a particular message . he says there are different levels of persuasion and the key to success lies in whether the persuasion is long term . " many things can be instrumental in persuasion but will they last in the long term ?" he says . " if i have the magical technique to take you out to dinner it might work , but it doesn ' t mean i can get you to go out with me ." it that ourselves your into own by nor which i itself how few under
