choosing the racy red shoes over the sensible loafers relates to how your brain assigns values to items or goods can ' t choose between the racy red shoes and the sensible loafers ? scientists say this indecisiveness relates to how your brain cells assign values to different items . researchers at harvard medical school in boston have identified neurones that seem to play a role in how a person selects different items or goods . scientists have known that cells in different parts of the brain react to attributes such as colour , taste or quantity . now dr camillo padaoa - schioppa and associate professor john assad describe in the journal nature how neurones involved in assigning values help people to make choices . " the neurones we have identified encode the value individuals assign to the available items when they make choices based on subjective preferences , a behaviour called economic choice ," padoa - schioppa says . the scientists say this research is part of the emerging field of neuroeconomics . the scientists located the neurones in an area of the brain known as the orbitofrontal cortex ( ofc ) while studying macaque monkeys that had to choose between different flavours and quantities of juices . they correlated the animals ' choices with the activity of neurones in the ofc with the valued assigned to the different types of juices . some neurones would be highly active when the monkeys selected three drops of grape juice , for example , or 10 drops of apple juice . other neurones encoded the value of only the orange juice or grape juice . " the monkey ' s choice may be based on the activity of these neurones ," says padoa - schioppa . earlier research involving the ofc showed that lesions in the area seem to have an association with eating disorders , compulsive gambling and unusual social behaviour . the new findings show an association between the activity of the ofc and the mental valuation process underlying choice behaviour , according to the scientists . " a concrete possibility is that various choice deficits may result from an impaired or dysfunctional activity of this population [ of neurones ], though this hypothesis remains to be tested ," says padoa - schioppa . my at how does over it against with as why t more down doing did as against did theirs herself whom and were there up these was out them these on am from a how both is on and t his
