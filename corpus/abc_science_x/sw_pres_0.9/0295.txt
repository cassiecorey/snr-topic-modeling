solar roof tiles would provide an alternative to conventional solar panel systems a roof tile that harnesses solar energy to heat water and generate electricity , has been invented by an australian industrial designer . the plastic tile is filled with solar cells and connects to a house ' s hot water system and electrical wiring . sebastian braat , a graduate of the university of western sydney , says the tiles are designed with urban dwellings in mind - particularly the new generation of so - called " mcmansion " style suburban homes . " my project is focussing on getting the technology into the city and easing the power burden our housing estates are rapidly creating ," he says . the tiles consist of a clear polycarbonate chassis containing a water vessel and photovoltaic cells . the tiles can be manufactured to match a variety of roof tile styles . between 12 and 18 % of thermal energy that hits the cells is converted into electricity . the remainder is used to heat the water . braat says he runs a coolant through the water in the tiles , which goes to a heat exchanger . the heat exchanger transfers the heat to a regular hot water storage tank . creating an energy surplus meanwhile , the solar cells generate electricity as direct current that goes to an inverter connected to the house ' s power box , which remains connected to the electricity grid . " the idea of being grid connected is that you generate loads more power than you need during the day and that gets fed back into the grid ," he says . " that means the house in effect is generating its own power and generating the excess into the grid . " if the house uses more than it generates the user gets charged , if not they get a credit from the power company ." how many tiles does it take ? braat says it takes about 200 tiles to generate a maximum of 1 . 5 kilowatts - more than enough for an average three - bedroom suburban house over a year . dr dong chen , a research scientist with csiro manufacturing and infrastructure technology , who wasn ' t involved in the design , says it makes sense to use roof tiles , or any exposed parts of a house , for solar heating . he says braat may need to look at how efficient the tiles are , and the pitch of the roof may affect this . chen says the inventor will also need to look at the cost of the tiles , including their maintenance , and how safe they are . he says it ' s also possible the roof could leak because the tiles may involve a number of small joints . only i will each is does should before after there some any some her his again until down into it about once both these with
