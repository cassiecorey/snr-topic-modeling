could automated answers to your it questions help reduce frustration when things go wrong ? the next time you email the it help desk , you may find yourself dealing with a computer , not a human . if a new system that australian researchers are developing takes off , ' intelligent ' computers will generate their own answers to your queries . the research by computer scientists dr yuval marom and professor ingrid zukerman of monash university in melbourne will be presented at the international joint conference on artificial intelligence in hyderabad , india next month . " help desk operators are generally dealing with the same thing over and over again ," says marom . and he says many emails can be answered by mixing and matching parts of generic responses , which the researchers ' software will generate . it can also help automate answers that require a more personalised response , says marom . the software was developed by analysing patterns between a set of 30 , 000 genuine pairs of questions and answers from an email help desk and generalising relationships between them . the emails came from the large international computer hardware company involved in the australian research council linkage grant that funded the research . the software defines several categories of questions that can be answered by generic responses , such as standard advice on how to arrange for a computer to be repaired . then there are questions that require more specific answers . these involve the system directly matching the words in the question to answers in the database , using similar technology to google . but unlike google , the customer can enter in a much longer query , describing the problem in detail and what they have already done to try and solve it . speed and accuracy marom says the benefit of automated responses is that they can be obtained at " google speed " instead of having to wait longer for a human to get around to typing a response . but how accurate are the answers ? marom says the system can be set so that it only fires off an automated answer when it has a certain level of confidence the answer is accurate . but customers will tolerate some inaccuracy or incomplete answers as long as they are sufficiently knowledgeable , he says . for example , if the system gives the customer the right webpage for downloading some software but tells them the wrong procedure , the customer might still find the automated answer useful . and if they get fed up they can always opt out and contact a human instead with the click a button , says marom . so far ratings by staff in marom ' s department suggest the automated answers are pretty good when compared to the answers humans give . but he says the next step is to evaluate the system online with a real - life email help desk . accuracy and jobs marom says that automated help desk software will cost jobs . but he says some humans will always be required to answer questions the system is not confident of answering . exactly how many humans will depend on where the confidence levels are set as it ' s a trade - off . if the confidence level is set too high , the system requires more humans to answer the harder questions . if the confidence level is set too low , it could risk annoying customers . marom says the system could be applied in many areas from tax queries to health queries . although of course , he says , the level of confidence for answering health queries would have to be pretty high . i we such than as from at whom my don themselves between few down
