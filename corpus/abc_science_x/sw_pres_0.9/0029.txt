maybe he should have had sex nervous public speakers should first have penetrative sex to ease the stress , according to a uk study . but masturbation is unlikely to have the same effect , the study published in the latest issue of the journal biological psychology suggests . professor stuart brody , a psychologist at the university of paisley , compared the impact of different sexual activities on blood pressure when a person later undergoes a stressful experience . brody asked 24 women and 22 men to keep a diary of their sexual activities for two weeks . the volunteers then underwent a stressful ordeal that involved making a speech in public and doing mental arithmetic out loud . volunteers who had had penetrative sex during the previous week or so had the least stress , and their blood pressure returned to normal fastest after their test . penetrative sex was far more effective in this regard than masturbation or oral sex . but those who had abstained completely from any sexual activity had the highest stress levels and blood pressure of all . brody also did a psychological profile of the volunteers to see whether they had an anxious or neurotic character , and evaluated their work stress and satisfaction with their partners . even when such factors were taken into account , sexual behaviour was clearly the best explanation for the stress responses . " the effects are not attributable to the short - term relief afforded by orgasm but , rather , endure for at least a week ," brody told new scientist magazine . he believes that penetrative sex may release a special ' pair - bonding ' hormone called oxytocin , which accounts for the calming effect . each from t up after under then now and s most at has where to our myself over until had our same
