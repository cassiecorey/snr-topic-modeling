new research suggests that a fall in methane emissions , partly attributed to diminishing wetlands , was only temporary china ' s booming economy and the wetlands of the northern hemisphere have emerged as key factors in what could be a future escalation in emissions of the greenhouse gas methane , according to new research . a study of methane emissions published in the journal nature today reports that atmospheric methane has increased over the past seven years after dropping during the 1990s . the paper says china ' s growing economy , including its flourishing coal industry , may be behind an increase in methane emissions from human activity . but this has been offset by a drop in natural emissions from swamps , bogs and wetlands , which are drying out as a result of prolonged drought . " if the drying trend is reversed and emissions from wetlands return to normal , atmospheric methane levels may increase again , worsening the problem of climate change ," says one of the report ' s authors , australian researcher dr paul steele . steele , a senior research scientist at csiro marine and atmospheric research , says the paper isn ' t making any firm predictions . " but we are pointing to the prospect [ that emissions will increase ]" he says . the methane menace steele says methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide . some 6 million tonnes of methane are emitted into the air each year , although the atmosphere can rid itself of some of this through chemical processes , including the oxidative effects of hydroxyl radicals . methane can be emitted as a result of natural or human activity . the primary natural source of methane is rotting wetland vegetation and belching by sheep and cattle . it ' s also produced by decaying landfill and exploitation of fossil fuels , including drilling for oil and coal mining . captured and marketed , methane can be turned into an alternative energy source , but poorly managed it escapes into the atmosphere where it can contribute to global warming . it ' s estimated to have been responsible for a fifth of the enhanced greenhouse effect over the past 200 years , steele says . he says it ' s unclear how much atmospheric methane comes from natural sources and how much from human activity . " we might know the total fairly well but we don ' t have a very good handle on how to partition the total amongst the range of sources ," he says . but in an accompanying editorial dr jos lelieveld , director of the max planck institute for chemistry in germany , says about two - thirds of global methane currently comes from human activity . he says atmospheric methane grew at a rate of more than 10 % per decade before 1980 but dropped to almost zero by the 1990s . coal mines and wetlands steele says one of the effects of prolonged drought has been a drying up of wetlands , particularly in the northern hemisphere . " bogs and swamps emit methane because they ' ve got all this rotting decaying vegetation at the base of the water ," he says . " if they dry up , then the emission of methane stops or slows down ." the economic growth and coal mining activity of asian countries like china , largely driven by the hunger for electricity , appears to be making up for any deficit . " coal mining can release methane to the atmosphere without safeguards ," steele says . " we don ' t know if they ' re being applied [ in china ' s mines ] and to which effect ." to be you very here those than having doing each theirs until himself only very by theirs above but have if
