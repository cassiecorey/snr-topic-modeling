microbiologists have found the bacteria resonsible for preparing fart - free beans beans cooked with a pinch of bacteria means diners can tuck in without the explosive results , scientists say . researchers from venezuela say two strains of bacteria are the key to producing fart - free beans . they show how lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum can be added to beans so they cause minimal distress to those who eat them , and to those around them . marisela granito of simon bolivar university in caracas and colleagues report their results in the journal of the science of food and agriculture . flatulence is caused by bacteria that live in the large intestine that break down food not already digested higher in the gut . the gas the bacteria produce is emitted from the body as a fart . granito and colleagues found that adding these two gut bacteria to black beans , or phaseolus vulgaris , before cooking makes them even less likely to cause flatulence . " legumes , and particularly phaseolus vulgaris , are an important source of nutrients , especially in developing countries ," granito ' s team writes . " in spite of being part of the staple diets of these populations , their consumption is limited by the flatulence they produce ." smart cooks know they can ferment beans , and make them less gas - inducing , by cooking them in the juices from a previous batch . but granito ' s team wanted to find out just which bacteria were responsible . cooking up a storm when the researchers fermented black beans with the two bacteria , they found it decreased the soluble fibre content by more than 60 % and lowered levels of raffinose , a compound known to cause gas , by 88 %. they fed the beans to rats and then analysed the rats ' droppings to ensure that the beans were digested and kept their nutritional value . when pre - soaked in l . casei , the beans stayed nutritious and produced few gas - causing compounds , the researchers report . " therefore , the lactic acid bacteria involved in the bean fermentation , which include l . casei as a probiotic , could be used as functional starter cultures in the food industry ," the researchers write . " likewise , the cooking applied after induced fermentation produced an additional diminution of the compounds related to flatulence ." only should before not after they be those they over about at
