passenger air travel is growing at the rate of around 5 % a year and could account for 15 % of man - made co2 emissions by 2050 restrictions on night flights could ease the aviation industry ' s fast - growing contribution to global warming , say uk scientists . dr nicola stuber and fellow meteorologists at the university of reading report their findings in today ' s issue of the journal nature . at certain altitudes , aircraft produce contrails - condensation trails caused when the plane ' s hot exhaust hits the chilly atmosphere . these contrails have a surprisingly big but also complex effect on the climate . because they are clouds , they trap heat that is emitted by the earth ' s surface , creating a " greenhouse effect " that adds to warming . yet during daytime , these clouds have a cooling effect because they are white and thus reflect some of the sun ' s energy back into space . in certain conditions , contrails can exist for several hours . stuber and team estimate the radiation caused by contrails at a busy flight corridor in southeast england . using high - resolution aircraft flight data and routine weather balloon data , they looked at " persistent " contrails : wakes that remained for an hour or more after the aircraft had flown over . night flights account for only 22 % of britain ' s annual air traffic but contribute between 60 to 80 % of the greenhouse effect from contrails , the scientists found . winter flights warm more stuber and team also found that flights during the winter months could contribute more to global warming . " we also found that flights between december and february contribute half of the annual mean climate warming , even though they account for less than a quarter of annual air traffic ," says stuber . although there are fewer flights during the winter months , the conditions needed to form contrails - the right temperature , amount of moisture in the air and aircraft altitude - are found more often then . a growing problem global emissions of man - made co2 are between 6 . 2 billion and 6 . 9 billion tonnes per year . added to this are around 1 . 5 billion tonnes from land use . commercial aircraft account for only a small contribution compared with power stations , industry and road traffic . however , passenger travel is growing at the rate of around 5 % a year , which means that this share will grow fast . a 1999 estimate by the un ' s intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) found that the airline industry accounted for 2 % of man - made co2 emissions in 1992 . but it would rise to as much as 15 % by 2050 . environmentalists are angry , complaining that airlines get a free ride when it comes to environmental taxes . changing altitude could also help in addition to rescheduling night flights for the daytime , planes could diminish their contribution to global warming by changing their altitude . a study published last year in the journal transportation research suggests that the regions of " ice - supersaturated " air where contrails form is only about 500 metres thick . the goal would be to fit sensors on aircraft that could inform pilots where this layer lies , thus enabling them to shift altitude accordingly . here where yourselves during when having under into an my any over both he we these by being have as ours other through be are above having
