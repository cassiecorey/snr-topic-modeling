soil harbours bacteria that contain antibiotic resistance genes . so is this where hospital superbugs get their protective genes from ? bacteria in dirt may be ' born ' with a resistance to antibiotics , which could help shed light on the problem of drug - defying superbugs , canadian researchers say . they tested hundreds of different bacteria found in soil and discovered that every one had some resistance to antibiotics , meaning they had evolved a mechanism for evading the effects of the drugs . the findings , published today in the journal science , could help to explain why bacteria so quickly develop resistance to antibiotics , and why drug companies must constantly develop new ones . " it explains where these things come from in the first place ," says dr gerry wright , of ontario ' s mcmaster university . " this work could prove to be extremely valuable to the drug development process ." wright ' s team dug up 480 strains of streptomyces bacteria and tested them for resistance to various antibiotics . " without exception , every strain ... was found to be multi - drug resistant to seven or eight antibiotics on average , with two strains being resistant to 15 of 21 drugs ," the scientists write . a logical place to start these particular bacteria do not infect people , but wright believes the findings almost certainly apply to other species of microbes . " it turns out that streptomyces make lots of antibiotics ," wright says . " anything that ends in ' mycin ' comes from streptomycin : vancomycin , streptomycin ." that was why they chose this group of bacteria . " we were curious to see where these things might come from in the first place , so it seemed that was a logical place to start . i expect lots of these [ drug - resistant ] genes are peppered all over the microbial community ," wright says . the scientists exposed the bacteria to known antibiotics and then searched for genes that were activated when the microbes survived . " we found old mechanisms and new mechanisms ," wright says . " we found a brand - new resistance mechanism to an antibiotic called telithromycin ," he says , referring to aventis ' drug ketek , which has only recently been approved in some countries . ketek was designed to overcome resistance to antibiotics , but one of the bacteria wright tested evolved a way to prevent it from working . developing resistance almost as soon as penicillin was introduced in the 1940s , bacteria began to develop resistance to its effects , prompting researchers to develop many new generations of antibiotics . but their overuse and misuse have helped fuel the rise of drug - resistant superbugs . the us centers for disease control and prevention says 70 % of infections that people get while in the hospital are resistant to at least one antibiotic . wright says his findings do not get doctors off the hook . he says they still must prescribe antibiotics only when they are needed , and stress to patients the need to use them properly . soil bacteria live in a constant kind of arms race , making antibiotics to protect themselves against other bacteria , and then evolving antibiotic resistance to evade the antibiotics made by other bacteria . " their coping tactics may be able to give us a glimpse into the future of clinical resistance to antibiotics ," wright says . who had having of she did me or more again about does both through
