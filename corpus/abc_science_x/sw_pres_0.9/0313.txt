poison ivy , a species introduced to australia and now a weed , will grow faster and become more poisonous with increased co2 levels add another item to the list of health threats posed by global warming : poison ivy that ' s more poisonous , and lots more of it . when scientists increased co2 to the levels expected to be seen at the middle of this century , poison ivy ( toxicodendron radicans ) grew more than twice as fast . the plants also produced more of a type of urushiol , the substance that causes an allergic reaction , the researchers report online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . " this is bad news for those of us who suffer from poison ivy ," says lead author dr jacqueline mohan of the marine biological laboratory in woods hole , massachusetts . mohan and her team studied plots of a forested area surrounded by pvc pipes that pumped out co2 , allowing them evaluate the effects of the greenhouse gas in a real - life forest environment . they compared poison ivy growth over a six - year period in three co2 - enriched areas and three areas with normal air . under the high - co2 conditions , the poison ivy plants grew 150 % faster every year than the control plants . the plants also contained 153 % more of the urushiol compound that causes an allergic reaction . more than 80 % of the world ' s population will develop an itchy rash if exposed to poison ivy . over the past two decades , mohan notes , scientists have observed increased worldwide growth in vines , which is in some cases choking out the regrowth of trees . vines benefit from extra co2 , she explains , as the gas fuels photosynthesis . unlike trees , vines have to devote relatively little energy to growing wood , and can instead pump the extra photosynthesis energy into leaf production .
