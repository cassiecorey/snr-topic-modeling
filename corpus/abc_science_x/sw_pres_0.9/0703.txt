wild emmer wheat , shown here , is more nutritious than some types of domestic wheat . so scientists have crossbred new and old strains to improve levels of protein , zinc and iron scientists have found a way to boost wheat ' s nutrient content by reintroducing a gene that was ' lost ' over the years as the wild plant was domesticated . writing in the journal science , the researchers say they used conventional breeding methods to bring the gene into cultivated wheat varieties , enhancing their protein , zinc and iron value . the gene , which professor jorge dubcovsky from the university of california , davis and colleagues have identified , has became nonfunctional for unknown reasons over the years . this occurred as humans cultivated the wild wheat , known as wild emmer wheat ( triticum turgidum ssp dicoccoides ). wheat represents one of the major crops feeding people worldwide , providing about 20 % of all calories consumed . the world health organization says that upward of 2 billion people get too little zinc and iron in their diet , and more than 160 million children under the age of 5 lack adequate protein . " we really can produce wheat with more protein and more zinc and iron ," dubcovsky says . " so if that is grown in a developing country or is used as food aid , it will really provide more of those needed things in places where it ' s necessary ." same taste in making the wheat more nutritious , the researchers did not change how it tastes , dubcovsky says . " we ' re not changing the composition or anything very dramatic in the grain ," he says . " i don ' t think a simple step like this will solve hunger in the world . i ' m not that naive . but i think it ' s heading in the right direction ," dubcovsky says . the gene made the grain mature more quickly while also boosting its protein and micronutrient content by 10 - 15 % in the pasta and bread wheat varieties with which the researchers worked . " what this gene does is it uses better what is in the plant already , so rather than leave the protein and the zinc and iron in the straw , we ' ve moved a little bit more into the grain ," dubcovsky says . the wheat varieties bred by the scientists are not genetically modified , which could help them become accepted commercially , they say . " we didn ' t do it by genetic modification . the normal wheat crosses perfectly well with the wild wheat . so we just crossed it after normal breeding ," dubcovsky says . the research team includes scientists from the us department of agriculture and the university of haifa in israel . dubcovsky heads a consortium of 20 public wheat - breeding programs called the wheat coordinated agricultural project . annual wheat production is estimated at 620 million tonnes of grain worldwide . than himself her nor can nor itself such what had i theirs itself over than when both were above now own again
