this gully deposit , which scientists say is evidence of water on mars , formed sometime between august 1999 and february 2004 . so does this mean that water is still flowing today ? photographs of mars show features that most likely were made by water flowing on the planet today , says the us space agency . " no one expected what we found today ," says dr kenneth edgett , a scientist with malin space science systems in san diego . " we are talking about liquid water that is present on mars right now ." the images were taken by nasa ' s mars global surveyor , which had been studying the red planet for a decade before an apparent mission - ending failure last month . the discovery raises the prospect that life could exist on mars today , says dr michael meyer , lead scientist for nasa ' s mars exploration program . the agency has mounted a series of increasingly sophisticated missions to look for signs of past water on mars in hopes of identifying areas that could have been suitable for life to form . " maybe we no longer have to think about following the water , but watching the water ," edgett says . the conclusion that water flows on mars today is based on photographs the global surveyor took of gullies etched in the martian soil . two sites in particular caught researchers ' eyes because there were noticeable changes between pictures taken six years ago and ones snapped in 2004 and 2005 . both show the gullies had filled with a light - coloured deposit , which is believed to be frozen water . scientists believe the water emanated from deep within the planet and gradually welled up toward the surface . once it encountered the frigid martian air , however , it froze , forming an ice dam . water continued to build up underground until there was enough pressure to burst the ice cap and allow a jet of water to flow down the channels . the amount of water is about what would be needed to fill five to 10 swimming pools , edgett says . the findings will be followed up by a new higher - resolution camera aboard nasa ' s mars reconnaissance orbiter , which began its mission last month . the global surveyor team also found new impact craters , raising the prospect that meteorite hits are a concern as nasa begins to think about sending human explorers to mars . theirs herself will under did once in other itself from some own when an be most in them were they he yours
