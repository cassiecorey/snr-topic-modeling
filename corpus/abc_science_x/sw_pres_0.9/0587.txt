this year ' s ozone loss can be explained by the temperatures above antarctica reaching the lowest recorded in the area since 1979 antarctica in 2006 suffered its highest recorded single - year loss in ozone , says the european space agency . ozone measurements made by the agency ' s envisat satellite shows a loss of 40 million tonnes on 2 october , exceeding the previous record of 39 million tonnes set in 2000 . ozone loss is calculated by measuring the area and depth of the so - called ozone hole in the stratosphere , about 25 kilometres above earth ' s surface . this year ' s ozone hole measures 28 million square kilometres , which is nearly as large as in 2000 , and the depth of the ozone hole is 100 dobson units , a measurement of the thickness of the layer , which rivals a record set in 1990 , the agency says . ozone filters out dangerous ultraviolet rays from the sun that damage vegetation and can cause skin cancer and cataracts . the layer has been badly damaged by industrial chemicals , especially chlorine and chlorofluorocarbons ( cfcs ), scientists say . the chemical reaction that thins ozone reaches its peak with colder high altitude temperatures in the southern hemisphere winter . " such significant ozone loss requires very low temperatures in the stratosphere combined with sunlight ," says the agency ' s atmospheric engineer dr claus zehner . " this year ' s extreme loss of ozone can be explained by the temperatures above antarctica reaching the lowest recorded in the area since 1979 ." last week , the world meteorological organization ( wmo ) gave notice that the seasonal ozone hole in 2006 was heading for a record . the ozone level globally has lowered by 0 . 3 % a year over the past decade . cfcs , mainly aerosol gases and refrigerants , and other ozone destroyers were controlled by an international treaty , the montreal protocol signed in september 1987 . but there is already so much of the pollution stored in the atmosphere that large ozone holes are expected to persist for the next couple of decades , the wmo says . the ozone layer over the antarctic will only be completely replenished 15 years later than predicted , by 2065 , according to the wmo and un environment programme . ozone in the stratosphere is protective . at ground level , though , ozone , as a chemical reaction between exhaust fumes and sunlight , is a pollutant that can be dangerous for people with bad respiratory or heart problems . or yourselves only after does don am at herself me against having all hers after down to after so
