this person of european descent is most likely to have wet , gooey earwax . now scientists know why geneticists say they know why people from some parts of the world have wet , gooey earwax and others have the dry , flaky stuff . they describe online today in the journal nature genetics how a single gene controls its consistency . human earwax is a secretion that traps insects , cleans the ear and prevents the outer parts of the auditory canal from drying out . but cerumen , to give it its scientific name , has long puzzled researchers , who have debated why different populations have a different consistency . for example , dry earwax is more common in people from china and other countries in eastern asia . and people of european or african descent are more likely to have the wet variety . dr koh - ichiro yoshiura , from nagasaki university and colleagues say mutations in a single gene hold the key . by looking at japanese people with different types of earwax , they identified the gene abcc11 , which codes for a type of cell channel . this channel acts as a kind of gate to control the flow of molecules , which in turn determines wax type . a mutation in this gene alters the channel ' s structure and reduces its activity , affecting the wax consistency . people who inherit two copies of the mutant gene , one from each parent , have dry earwax . any other combination gives you goo . the authors compared the gene with earwax genes from 33 different populations around the world , plotting a time - map of where and when the gene mutated . they conclude that the change in the channel type first occurred in northeast asia , a change that then spread throughout asia , and to native american and inuit populations with asian origins . s the him itself
