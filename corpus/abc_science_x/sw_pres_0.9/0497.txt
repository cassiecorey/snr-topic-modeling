chocolate , citrus or stinky ? researchers are identifying the fungi that give regional varieties of coffee their distinctive taste fungi are the secret to tasty coffee , says a brazilian researcher who is the first to identify the moulds that give coffee its distinctive range of flavours and aromas . dr martha taniwaki of brazil ' s institute of food technology presented her research at the international mycological conference in cairns this week . taniwaki says while the characteristics of the bean partly determine taste and aroma , naturally occurring fungi also put the zing in your favourite brew . " we are doing a project to correlate the presence of certain species of fungi in coffee with coffee flavour ," she says . the research team collected raw coffee beans from farms in sao paulo and minas gerais in brazil , disinfected them , incubated them for seven days , and isolated the fungi . then the team got down to the pleasant part of the experiment . they roasted , ground , brewed and drank the raw samples , rating them for body , aroma , acidity , bitterness , astringency and sweetness . some of the flavours associated with moulds included floral , citric , caramel , chocolate and toast . the fungi occur naturally inside the coffee been and are associated with regional characteristics caused by soil , climate and humidity . while the pleasant taste - producing fungi are not harmful to health , others can be toxic , and these often produce rancid , stinky , smoky , woody or fermented bouquets . tanawaki says her research is currently focused on isolating the various fungi and how they are metabolised . but it may be possible to use the knowledge to produce ranges of coffee with a particular flavour , potentially complementing the traditional bottles of vanilla or hazelnut flavourings found at your local cafe . " we can encourage the good fungi to grow and use it to produce good flavours , like wine or other food like cheese where you use mould or yeast to ... give a special flavour ," she says . professor paul gadek , an australian plant molecular biologist and head of tropical plant sciences at james cook university , says taniwaki ' s research has implications for australia , where coffee is a growth industry . he says it would be interesting to find out which species of fungi are found in australian coffee beans . " what are the characteristics that we can grow regionally to generate distinctive flavours ?" each her by about are he when yourself up while will yourselves because itself a whom himself if most
