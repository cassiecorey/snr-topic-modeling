sitting in cramped conditions on a long - haul flight isn ' t the main risk factor for dvt , researchers say . the cabin air quality may be to blame low cabin air pressure and poor oxygenation enhance the risk of deep - vein thrombosis ( dvt ) in susceptible passengers , a study suggests . until now , dvt has been most widely associated with remaining inactive for long periods , like in the cramped conditions of an aircraft cabin . but a study in today ' s issue of the lancet journal suggests there may be additional risk factors . dvt occurs when a clot forms in leg veins during periods of sedentary activity . the clot can then migrate to the heart , lung or brain , sometimes days or weeks later , and inflict a heart attack or stroke . even though the phenomenon has been known since world war ii , it has in recent years become a major issue for the airline industry , through lawsuits in which people who have had dvt place the blame on cramped economy seating in long flights . the airlines retort that dvt can occur long after a flight , which thus makes it impossible to establish a link , and point out that clotting can occur in other forms of sedentary activity , even from sitting and reading a book . the latest research puts the ball back into the airlines ' court , pointing the finger at cabin air quality as a potential risk factor . a team led by professor frits rosendaal of leiden university medical center in the netherlands , monitored levels of a key clotting protein called thrombin - antithrombin ( tat ) complex among 71 healthy men and women aged 20 - 39 . a total of 40 % of the people in the study were selected as they took the contraceptive pill , had a gene variation called factor v leiden , or both , conditions which greatly increase the risk of blood clotting . up , up and away the volunteers were taken onboard a specially - chartered boeing 757 for a non - stop eight - hour flight . it cruised at around 11 , 000 metres with a cabin pressure that corresponds to an altitude of 1800 - 2100 metres . blood samples were taken before , during and after the flight . a couple of weeks later , the same group underwent the same tests , but this time at a movie marathon , watching comedy and action films for eight hours . they were not allowed to drink alcohol , take aspirin or wear elastic stockings during the flight or the movies , and were asked to remain seated as much as possible . the group was monitored for the final time during eight hours of regular daily activity . after the flight , the concentration of tat complex rose by about 30 % on average across the group . it fell by about 2 % after the cinema , and by almost 8 % after the ' daily life ' experiment . the post - flight rise was overwhelmingly concentrated in just 11 of the 71 individuals , especially those who took oral contraceptives and also had factor v leiden . the findings suggest that " flight - associated factors " are the cause behind increased clot formation after a long trip , say the team , which conducted the study for the who . the researchers put the ring of suspicion around hypobaric hypoxia , a combination of low cabin pressure and a low oxygen level compared with terrestrial air conditions . who ' s most at risk ? the data also provides a useful pointer for medical help to those most at risk . there already exists an array of simple techniques or over - the - counter drugs for combatting dvt . these include cutting out alcohol on a flight , stretching one ' s legs , taking an aspirin and wearing compressive stockings that improve blood circulation . there is also a powerful anti - clotting prescription drug called heparin . this medication has side - effects , which means it should be targeted at those most at risk , such as women on the pill and with factor v leiden , cancer patients and recent surgery patients , says dr hans stricker , a doctor at the charity hospital in locarno , switzerland , in a commentary . previous studies have found a two - to - fourfold risk of dvt after air travel , while a study in 2003 estimated that dvt may occur among one in every 100 frequent long - haul air travellers , in business class as well as economy . there was once s other same because the when again had she nor you such have until their can will me but into am yours don out themselves are these and any with
