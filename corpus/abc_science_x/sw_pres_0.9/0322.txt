the discovery of 11 , 000 year old figs shows people became farmers much earlier than we once thought dried - up figs found in israel may have been the first cultivated crop more than 11 , 000 years ago , researchers say . the discovery , published in the journal science , pushes back the earliest estimates of when agriculture began by 1000 years . and it suggests that , centuries before people figured out how to plant barley and other crops , they knew how to propagate fruit trees for sweet treats , say researchers professor ofer bar - yosef of harvard university and israeli co - authors . "[ some ] 11 , 000 years ago , there was a critical switch in the human mind , from exploiting the earth as it is to actively changing the environment to suit our needs ," says bar - yosef , a professor of anthropology . " people decided to intervene in nature and supply their own food rather than relying on what was provided by the gods . this shift to a sedentary lifestyle grounded in the growing of wild crops such as barley and wheat marked a dramatic change from 2 . 5 million years of human history as mobile hunter - gatherers ." people were known to have cultivated figs for thousands of years but this finding surprised even experts . " it is generally accepted that the fig tree was domesticated in the near east some 6500 years ago ," says bar - yosef ' s team . " here we report the discovery of nine carbonised fig fruits ... stored in gilgal i , an early neolithic village , located in the lower jordan valley , which dates to 11 , 400 to 11 , 200 years ago ." a special type of fig the figs are a variety that produces a large , sweet fruit , as opposed to the wild type , the researchers say . in this variety , known as parthenocarpic figs , the fruit develops without insect pollination and is prevented from falling off the tree , which allows it to become soft , sweet and edible . but because such figs do not produce seeds , they cannot reproduce unless people propagate them , perhaps by planting shoots or branches . " dried figs similar in size and structure imported from iran are found today in the markets of london ," the scientists say . dried figs the carbonised figs were not distorted , which , the researchers say , suggests they may have been dried for human consumption . " once the parthenocarpic mutation occurred , humans must have recognised that the resulting fruits do not produce new trees , and fig tree cultivation became a common practice ," bar - yosef says . " in this intentional act of planting a specific variant of fig tree , we can see the beginnings of agriculture . this edible fig would not have survived if not for human intervention ." at the same site researchers found foods that must have been gathered , such as acorns and wild oats . he i herself because herself an doing most where before be over at once these hers more did me again who here
