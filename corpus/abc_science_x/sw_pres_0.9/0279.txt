will new copyright laws protect online artists ? the federal government ' s proposed changes to australian copyright law fail to address issues facing digital artists , experts say . attorney general philip ruddock announced the reforms this week , saying they would make the law fairer for consumers and tougher on copyright pirates . but damien o ' brien of the queensland university of technology law school , says the revised laws profess , but essentially fail , to keep track with developing technologies and emerging markets . " it doesn ' t look like they ' re very radical at all ," he says . " they seem fairly conservative ." he says the new laws will let people tape their favourite tv show or download music onto their mp3 players . but he says they won ' t make life any easier for the creators of so - called internet and video mashups , which combine content from a number of different sources to produce something new . o ' brien , who has co - authored a paper called mashups , remixes and copyright law published on the university website , says most mashups made by unauthorised use of copyright material will remain illegal under the proposed laws . mashups are an example of remix culture , which has roots in the postmodern tendency to cannibalise texts from various sources and is being driven by technology that makes this easier to do than ever before . for example a website could combine music from one source with images from another source and a search function from somewhere else . mashups are common in music videos and websites . for example , pop star kylie minogue has used legal mashups in her music videos while the website chicagocrime mixes police data with google maps . meanwhile , the ispecies search links data from genbank , academic literature from google scholar and images from yahoo image search . " the challenge ... is the extent to which mashup and remix artists should be allowed to borrow , in a seamless manner , from the past to create the future ," o ' brien writes in his paper . " for the first time in history creativity ... is subject to regulation ." professor matthew rimmer , an expert in copyright law at the australian national university , agrees the proposed laws don ' t do much to address issues in the latest technologies . he says the changes go some way to recognising the use of copyright works for critique and humour . " but it ' s not a carte blanche ," he says . o ' brien says it ' s disappointing that the reforms didn ' t include an open - ended " fair use " clause , which would be one way of mashup artists and others using copyright material legally . creative commons and mashup guilds one way to address restrictions placed on mashup artists is through the concept of a creative common , says jessica coates of the creative commons project run from queensland university of technology . under the concept , artists can license their work for use in certain ways , including a mashup . " the idea is that [ licences ] can be used by owners to make their work more widely available ," coates says . " if you ' re trying to do innovation in a digital realm it can be very hard because you ' re using reproductions all the time ... so the idea with a creative common licence is to try to get material out into the common realm as long as it isn ' t used for commercial purposes ." mashup guilds are another solution , says o ' brien . " mashup artists can form guilds to protect themselves against copyright holders who threaten to sue them ," he says . " it ' s the idea that if they form a group they can try and counterbalance the threat of litigation ." testing the bounds rimmer says mashup artists may enjoy operating on the fringes of the law . " one reason that mashups have attracted such interest and popular acclaim is that they partly depend on the illegality , they depend on breaching the normal controls ," he says . " there are always going to be people who don ' t seek permission and there ' s always going to be an innovative culture going on beyond the limits of the law ." a draft bill including the reforms will be released shortly , the government says . as you now a through by him why myself between at by before at ourselves off under any are no all have where through an too they of does me i any of
