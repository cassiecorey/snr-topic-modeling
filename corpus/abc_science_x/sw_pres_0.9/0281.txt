two miners walk free from a tasmanian goldmine after being trapped a kilometre underground , highlighting the dangers of mine work australian researchers are developing a computerised system that monitors the performance of miners and tells management if workers are getting tired . the system , designed to improve safety for haul truck operators , will be discussed at the national conference of the cooperative research centres association this week , shortly after the beaconsfield mining disaster in northern tasmania , in which one miner was killed and two others were trapped for two weeks . university of sydney phd student stewart worrell , who is being funded by crcmining , says the sensing device wouldn ' t have made a difference in the beaconsfield rockfall because fatigue wasn ' t an issue . but he says the goldmine accident , which took the life of miner larry knight and trapped his workmates brant webb and todd russell , highlights the danger of working in mines . worrell says the technology is all about fatigue management . he says fatigue statistics are under - reported , but us figures for 2001 - 2003 show there are eight fatigue - related fatalities in mines each year . he says the system uses sensors fitted to the trucks and analyses data collected during haul operations , like the ability of the driver to keep to a straight line and driver speed . " we have sensors attached to trucks which can monitor the truck ' s position on the road and detect when other trucks and vehicles are nearby ," he says . " the software analyses how a driver ' s performance changes over the duration of the shift and from there we can determine when there are threats and alert the driver . " we can detect if the truck ' s driving off the road or if there ' s a potential collision . " we might say ' this guy ' s driven over the centre of the road a couple of times so it ' s time to have a break '." data stored on each truck is also automatically downloaded to a central database when the haul truck returns to the drop - off area . there , it ' s filtered and refined and the statistics are reported to mining management , which can then use the information to upgrade safety or predict the impact of any planned changes . the system is already in place in two west australian mines and other operations in australia and internationally are considering taking it up , worrell says . he says the technology is particularly suited to a mining environment , which tends to be in an enclosed area , but it ' s also being considered for train drivers . of further was against after
