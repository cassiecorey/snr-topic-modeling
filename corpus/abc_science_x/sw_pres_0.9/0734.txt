africa is suffering from a double blow : malaria and hiv . now scientists say that one could exacerbate the other malaria may be helping to spread hiv across africa , the continent hardest hit by aids , scientists say . the way the two diseases interact greatly expands the prevalence of both among people in sub - saharan africa , a team of scientists say today in the journal science . malaria , a mosquito - borne disease caused by a parasite , greatly boosts viral load , the amount of hiv in the blood of infected people , they say . this makes them more likely to infect a sexual partner with hiv . " higher viral load causes more hiv transmission , and malaria causes high hiv viral load ," says lead study author dr laith abu - raddad of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle and the university of washington . abu - raddad , an aids researcher , estimates that malaria has helped hiv infect hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of people in sub - saharan africa . at the same time , hiv fuels malaria ' s spread because hiv - infected people are more susceptible to malaria as a result of hiv ravaging the immune system , the body ' s natural defences , the researchers say . aids and malaria are concentrated in sub - saharan africa . and abu - raddad says scientists were puzzled when they realised that the risky sexual behaviour by people in the region was not by itself sufficient to explain the swift spread of hiv , so other factors must be involved . they focused their work on kisumu , a kenyan city by lake victoria where hiv and malaria are both common . they say 5 % of hiv infections can be blamed on the increased hiv viral load due to malaria , and 10 % of adult malaria cases can be blamed on hiv . since 1980 , 8500 more people became hiv positive , and there were 980 , 000 more episodes of malaria ( a person can get it more than once ) in a city whose adult population is 200 , 000 , the study found . public health efforts the findings have implications for public health efforts , abu - raddad says , showing the importance for authorities to tackle these diseases together . of the 39 . 5 million people worldwide infected with hiv , 24 . 7 million are in the poor countries of sub - saharan africa . about 2 . 1 million of the world ' s 2 . 9 million aids deaths in the past year were also in this region . malaria kills more than a million people annually , mostly young children in sub - saharan africa . the researchers produced their results with a mathematical model using hiv and malaria infection data gathered in malawi by dr james kublin of the hutchinson center . this enabled them to quantify for the first time the synergy between malaria on hiv and its toll on people . scientists previously determined that a lack of male circumcision and the incidence of genital herpes also were facilitating the spread of hiv . abu - raddad notes that circumcised men are much less likely to get hiv , and that genital herpes opens a door for hiv to infect a person . abu - raddad says malaria now can be considered a third serious factor facilitating the spread of hiv . the two diseases drive one another even though they have different modes of transmission - malaria by mosquito and hiv predominantly by sexual intercourse - abu - raddad notes . he says once a person with hiv gets malaria , his or her viral load goes up and stays higher for six to eight weeks , making the person far more infectious to others . off themselves most what between was again in will so too just same where by that on been a an his and only does
