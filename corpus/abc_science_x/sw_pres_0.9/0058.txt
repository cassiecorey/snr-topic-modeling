this kentia or thatch palm grows near its sister species , the curly palm . so how did the two species arise when there are no geographical barriers between them ? one of the world ' s best examples of sympatric speciation , when two species from a single ancestor form in the absence of a geographical barrier , has been found among the swaying palm trees on australia ' s lord howe island . researchers have found two sister species of palms living side by side on the tiny world heritage listed island 580 kilometres off australia ' s east coast . the two species , the kentia or thatch palm ( howea forsteriana ) and curly palm ( h . belmoreana ), appear to have diverged after they began flowering at different times of year , probably as a result of differing soil preferences . the international team of researchers , including those from the uk ' s royal botanic gardens , kew , reports its findings online today in the journal nature . it ' s generally accepted that evolution occurs by one species breaking into two by the process of allopatric speciation . this might occur when , say , a mountain range separates a species and the two populations change gradually until they become so different they can no longer interbreed . but there are also theoretical reasons to believe that a species can split into two within its own area , a phenomenon known as sympatric speciation . the researchers used a range of techniques to show that the palm species are sisters and indeed diverged much more recently than the island ' s creation by volcanic activity 6 . 4 - 6 . 9 million years ago . they calculate that the palms ' common ancestor probably arrived from mainland australia as long as 4 . 5 - 5 . 5 million years ago . and more recently , h . forsteriana diverged from its related species , an ancestor of h . belmoreana . soil is the key they note that the flowering times of the palm trees differed on different soils , indicating the ancestors of the two species may have adapted to different soil types . they add that perhaps living on those different soil types modified the palm trees ' flowering times , reducing their chance of interbreeding . " that ' s probably what kick - started the speciation process and resulted in them finally being two separate species ," says associate professor david rowell , from the australian national university , canberra . " this paper is very clever because it uses lord howe island , which is very small , and where it is very unlikely that a species would be split into two , and so therefore it seems to be very strong evidence that sympatric speciation has occurred in this case . " that being the case , it lends strength to the models , hypotheses and theories that people have put up about how evolution works ." fishy clues to new species meanwhile , german researchers have discovered another case of apparent sympatric speciation , this time in two species of fish in lake apoyo crater , in nicaragua . a report in today ' s nature says the lake is just 5 kilometres across and less than 23 , 000 years old . but dna profiling shows that , during that time , it was colonised by the species amphilophus citrinellus , which gave rise to a . zaliosus . then her its which what
