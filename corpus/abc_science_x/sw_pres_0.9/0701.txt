silicon has been converted into a superconductor , but at very low temperatures . if this could be reproduced at room temperatures , then we could build super - efficient computer circuit boards scientists say they have treated silicon , the material of choice for semiconductors , so that it paradoxically becomes a superconductor , a material that offers no resistance . this potentially has huge uses in the efficient transfer of energy , whether that ' s on a large scale like electronic cables or on a smaller scale , like in a computer chip . but superconductivity in the treated silicon occurs only at 0 . 3 & deg ; k , or 0 . 3 & deg ; c above absolute zero . this means the novel material has no practical use and is only of theoretical interest right now . dr etienne bustarret of france ' s national centre for scientific research ( cnrs ) in grenoble and colleagues converted the silicon by ' doping ' it with high levels of boron , using a pulsed laser at normal pressure . they publish their research today in the journal nature alongside a commentary that describes the findings as " a breakthrough ". superconductivity has been found in only a number of materials which , at very cold temperatures , allow electricity to flow through them without offering any resistance or losing some of the energy as heat . scientific but also industrial interest in superconductors is huge , as superconductive cable and dynamos would be many times more energy - efficient than traditional copper and other conductors . in addition , superconductor computers could be many times faster than today ' s . their semiconductors would not be hampered by heat , one of the biggest problems facing designers today who are tasked with crowding ever more circuits onto a chip . exotic oxides , cooled by liquid nitrogen , have provided the best transition temperatures to superconductivity , with temperatures as high as 160 & deg ; k . it each ourselves some itself whom until your this ours
