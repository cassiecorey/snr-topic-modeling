adding an immune system booster to diluted vaccines may mean a little vaccine goes a long way much smaller doses of vaccines may be needed to combat outbreaks of bird flu , tuberculosis and sars than once thought , canadian research shows . the research by a team at the university of british columbia could mean more shots will be available . the team led by professor wilfred jefferies says standard doses can be reduced 100 - fold and still be safe by adding an immune system booster commonly found in the human body . the study shows that when the immune system booster is added at low doses to vaccines and injected into mice exposed to rabies , measles and smallpox , an immune response kicks in to protect them from infection . the so - called tap molecules deliver peptides inside cells from the body ' s immune system or vaccines . if this transporter is switched off , as in cancerous cells , disease fighters cannot be moved where they need to go within the cell to do their job . the results of the seven - year study were published in a recent issue of the journal plos pathogens . " this new paradigm is shown to be applicable to many viruses , including poxviruses , and could significantly advance the creation of new vaccines and improve those that already exist ," the scientists say . this could prove especially important if the h5n1 bird flu , expected by many to be the next worldwide pandemic , begins to pass between humans . what happens in a bird flu outbreak ? bird flu has killed some 85 people since emerging in asia in 2003 . experts say it could kill millions if it mutates into a form easily passed between humans . it could take up to six months to develop a vaccine should human - to - human transmission occur . with smaller dose sizes , a hundred times more vaccine shots could be made within the same period of time . " we ' re hoping it will be incorporated into a number of different vaccines ," says jefferies . " it ' s powerful because we think it can make general vaccines much better ." smaller doses will also make some vaccines , including that for smallpox and anthrax , less toxic and therefore better tolerated by those with weaker immune systems , jefferies says . hiv patients , in particular , could benefit , as well as up to an estimated 20 % of the population who react badly to vaccines . " some pathogens don ' t currently have effective vaccines ," says co - author timothy vitalis . " i hope the technology can be used to solve some of the needs in controlling infectious diseases ." how do you boost a vaccine ? jefferies first imagined the possibility of this application for vaccines after noticing that tap is turned off in cancer cells , meaning that the body ' s natural immune defense does not recognise that it needs to attack these cells . he found that when tap was added to the cancerous cells the immune system suddenly ' switched on ' and fought back . " tap is a key molecule in the creation of immune responses ," says jefferies . " this molecule fought viruses when it was found in normal amounts in the cell . i thought , ' if a little bit is good , is a lot [ of tap ] even better ?" researchers say they are not sure why the tap molecules are turned off in cancer cells , but hope further study may eventually lead to a new cancer treatment too . but that is still years away . jefferies says the team is currently trying the method out with prototype vaccines that could lead to clinical trials in the next two years , depending on funding . the research was primarily funded by the canadian institutes of health research .
