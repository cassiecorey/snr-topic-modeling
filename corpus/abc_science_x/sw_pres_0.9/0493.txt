a relative of this ancient marine organism used to dig through the mud , forming a network of tunnels trilobites , the extinct marine creatures famous to fossil - hunters everywhere , may have once done digging of their own , say uk and swedish researchers . rocks found in a swedish limestone quarry contain the remains of trilobites inside networks of tunnels , which appear to have been subsurface thoroughfares for the little bug - like organisms . " it ' s very rare to find a trilobite in a burrow ," says amherst college ' s associate professor whitey hagadorn , an expert on tracks , burrows and other ' trace ' fossils that can give important clues to a long - lost species ' behaviour and environment . there ' s only one other such fossil known , he says , and even that one doesn ' t show evidence that the tunnels were much more than single - use , one - way streets that collapsed after the animals made their way through the muck . " the fact that they form open networks , that is new and different ," says hagadorn . such sand - filled tunnels are common in the fossil record , he says , and have generally been attributed to soft - bodied animals that left behind no hard parts . but in recent years , palaeontologists have begun to suspect that trilobites may have also done some digging . finding trilobites inside tunnel remains in sweden ' s 465 - million - year - old holen limestone is , therefore , a fitting but unexpected hint about how the ubiquitous creatures fit into the palaeozoic ocean ecosystem . dr lesley cherns of cardiff university says these particular fossils were found by accident . " we sat down to lunch and i noticed that there were trilobites in these burrows ," says cherns , who co - authored a paper in this month ' s issue of the journal geology . a life underground the trilobites were probably killed by something like a sudden upwelling of oxygen - poor water or some other quick and deadly event , cherns explains . the tunnels were then soon buried by a thick layer of mud that sealed them off from scavengers and helped to preserve the evidence . no - one is quite sure what the trilobites were doing underground . they could have been hiding from the nautilus - like predators that cruised the palaeozoic oceans , says cherns . or they may have used the water flowing through the tunnels to help oxygenate their gills , like some modern lobsters do , she says . hagadorn has other explanations . " they could have been going down to eat , reproduce , hide ... who knows ? " hopefully this will motivate people to go out and look for more of these ." that could eventually answer some of those questions , he says . theirs who into who who own on further just some off on
