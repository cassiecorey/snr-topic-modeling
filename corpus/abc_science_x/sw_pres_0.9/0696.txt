green turtle returning to the sea after laying a clutch of eggs on the beach at enu island in indonesia scientists have conducted the first genetic census of endangered green turtles throughout southeast asia and australia , providing a conservation tool . " the green turtle is on the red list of endangered species internationally , so we wanted to be able to identify if there were particular groups that might need specific conservation efforts ," says phd student kiki dethmers from the university of queensland . her work on the turtle chelonia mydas appears in the november issue of the journal molecular ecology . turtle populations are shrinking for a range of reasons , she says . some are hunted for food , others are accidentally caught in fishing nets , while others still are affected by a loss of habitat or viral diseases . dethmers and her colleagues gathered skin or blood samples from turtles nesting at 27 different sites in malaysia , the philippines , micronesia , indonesia , papua new guinea and australia . from each sample they extracted a mitochondrial dna , genetic material that is passed down from mother to child . " mitochondrial dna is inherited through the female line , and females come to the beaches to nest , so our study was based on sampling the female population ," dethmers says . the results show that there are just 17 distinct genetic groups within the region . some groups were made up of a single nesting beach . but in other cases , nesting sites in different locations turn out to be genetically related . some of the groups were substantial , such as the 125 , 000 related turtles that nest on western australia ' s northwest shelf . others , like some groups in malaysia , might contain just a few hundred turtles . the information dethmers and her colleagues have gathered could be vital for future conservation efforts . " the turtles ' situation varies from one area to another ," she says . " our data would be useful for example if one of the groups is particularly threatened , because it would give you an idea of how many turtles are being affected . " this can help you make predictions about whether that is going to make a certain population go extinct ." an do but them that or each hers as herself a itself that theirs him we i an how your during
