pericles probably died of typhoid fever , as did as many as one - third of his fellow athenians modern dna analysis of ancient dental pulp suggests that typhoid fever caused the plague that helped to end the golden age in athens , scientists say . the dna collected from teeth from an ancient greek burial site is similar to a modern organism that causes typhoid fever , an infection spread by contaminated food or water . " studying the historical aspects of infectious disease can be a powerful tool for several disciplines to learn from ," says dr manolis papagrigorakis of university of athens , a co - author of the study published in the international journal of infectious diseases . " we believe this report to be of outstanding importance for many scientific fields , since it sheds light on one of the most debated enigmas in medical history ." up to one - third of athenians are thought to have died from the plague that spread to greece from ethiopia , egypt and libya in 430 - 426 bc . several diseases including smallpox , bubonic plague , anthrax and measles have been suggested as the cause of the plague , one of whose most prominent victims was the athenian golden age leader pericles . the plague is thought to have changed the balance of power between athens and sparta , ending athenian dominance . the scientists describe how they extracted dna from a mass burial pit in a cemetery dating back to the time the plague struck greece . papagrigorakis and his team say the dna sequences resembled salmonella enterica serovar typhi , the organism that causes typhoid fever . being on out such then doing at about t there were are having hers will an above into was
