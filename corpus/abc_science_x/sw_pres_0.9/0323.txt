the milky way has asymmetrical spiral arms , some longer than others our galaxy is a much wilder looking tentacled beast than suspected , say astronomers who have used a new technique to map the milky way . radio astronomers used data from a painstaking galaxy - wide survey of hydrogen gas clouds throughout the milky way . they found that instead of being a clean , symmetrical spiral , our home galaxy has extra long arms sprouting out on one side and is warped and armless on the other . the odd layout could be the result of colossal cannibalistic galactic collisions or intergalactic ' tides ', say the researchers online on the journal science . astronomer professor leo blitz of the university of california at berkeley says the most surprising thing about the spiral arms on our half of the milky way " is that we could see spiral structure all the way to the edge of the [ galactic ] disc ". the long , elegant , spiral arms are visible , despite a galaxy full of dust , because hydrogen gas emits radio waves that penetrate the dust . the distances to the various arms could be worked out by the doppler shift in their radio waves . this is similar , in principle , to how the tone of a train ' s horn sounds higher - pitched when it ' s approaching than when it ' s receding . far side of the milky way in contrast to the near side of the milky way , the far side appears less orderly . instead of having clearly defined curved arms there ' s a messy bulging area , explains co - author evan levine . " it ' s bent like a vinyl record in the sun ," levine says . " that would show up in a map like this ." as for what causes the weird warping , it could be the result of galactic collisions . " this lack of symmetry often occurs as galaxies eat little galaxies ," blitz says . another possibility is that the bulge is caused by the gravitational tug of the milky way ' s small satellite galaxies . visible from the southern hemisphere the most obvious of these satellite galaxies are the magellanic clouds , which are visible to the naked eye from earth ' s southern hemisphere . " the magellanic clouds are very prominent , like the tides of the earth ," says astrophysicist professor frank shu of the university of california at san diego . earth ' s oceans bulge with tides because of the external gravitational tug of the moon . likewise , the magellanic clouds may cause the bulge in the far side of the milky way , he explains . more details about the milky way ' s structure are likely to be forthcoming , says levine . blind spots their new map has a few blind spots caused by the motion of our own solar system inside the milky way . these blind spots show up on their map as an empty circle at the centre of the galaxy and as two blank wedges on opposite sides of our solar system . it ' s possible that more advanced analyses of the data will glean meaningful information from the hydrogen emissions of those areas as well , says levine . for his part , blitz is pleased to be able to see so much of the galaxy after many years of trying . he recalls that in 1982 he published another paper in science describing only a part of a single spiral arm . " it ' s like trying to figure out the shape of a forest when you ' re sitting in the middle of it ," says blitz . below up her too between own what from each up yourself don out all t be no these its
