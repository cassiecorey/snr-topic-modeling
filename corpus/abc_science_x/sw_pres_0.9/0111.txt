a floating iceberg off the antarctic peninsula antarctica ' s mammoth ice sheet is in " significant decline ", scientists say , probably due to climate change . us researchers at the university of colorado at boulder say online in the journal science today the antarctic ice sheet is losing up to 152 cubic kilometres of ice a year . " this is the first study to indicate the total mass balance of the antarctic ice sheet is in significant decline ," says dr isabella velicogna , of the university ' s cooperative institute for research in environmental sciences . the team calculated that the ice sheet lost 152 cubic kilometres a year from april 2002 to august 2005 , give or take 80 cubic kilometres . this is equivalent to global seas rising 0 . 4 millimetres a year , with a margin of error of 0 . 2 millimetres , the researchers say . the bulk of the loss is occurring in the west antarctic ice sheet , according to velicogna , whose team used two satellites orbiting earth in tandem to gather data . these satellites estimate earth ' s global gravity field . and variations in the gravity field over time were used to determine changes in earth ' s mass distribution , necessary for estimating changes in mass of the antarctic ice sheet . " the changes we are seeing are probably a good indicator of the changing climatic conditions there ," velicogna says . the study seems to contradict the 2001 assessment by the intergovernmental panel on climate change which forecast that the antarctic ice shelf would actually gain mass in the 21st century due to higher precipitation in a warming climate . the us researchers say the ipcc estimate was based on sparse coverage of coastal areas , which would have affected the results . twice the size of australia as earth ' s fifth largest continent , antarctica is twice the size of australia and contains 70 % percent of earth ' s fresh water resources . the ice sheet is an average 1981 metres thick . research from the british antarctic survey suggests melting of the west antarctic ice sheet alone would raise global sea levels by more than 6 metres . then as below below himself doing how theirs himself at into has no while hers or their why more has same which no been had not from these
