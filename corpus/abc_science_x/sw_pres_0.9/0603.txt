scientists have used computers to analyse how shakespeare used certain words and phrases and have come up with a unique linguistic signature a computational fingerprint that uniquely characterises william shakespeare ' s writing style is helping to dispel any lingering doubts that he penned his own plays . the method could analyse not only plays attributed to shakespeare but anonymous or controversial writings by other authors . " people will take these programs and use the design to go to the 19th century and talk about lord byron ," says professor arthur kinney , director of the massachusetts center for renaissance studies at the university of massachusetts , amherst . kinney leads the research with australia ' s professor hugh craig , director of the centre for literary and linguistic computing at the university of newcastle . the researchers built a massive database containing tens of thousands of words from shakespeare ' s works as well the works of other playwrights of his time . then they used a method called computational stylistics to analyse the usage , occurrence , spelling and placement of phrases , as well as common and rare words . for example , the word ' gentle ' appears almost twice as frequently in works by shakespeare than in works by other writers . and shakespearean drama frequently finds the word ' farewell ' preceded by ' hail '. a computational fingerprint is created from known works and then compared with the fingerprints of unknown works to see if there is a match . doubts controversy over whether shakespeare , an ordinary , working class man from the countryside , could have authored such remarkable writing began percolating in the middle of the 19th century . those who doubt his ability suggest that another , more educated man , such as the earl of oxford , edward devere , penned the plays . why would the earl attribute them to shakespeare ? to deflect criticism , some claim . during the early part of the 1600s , the gathering of a large crowd at a theatre signalled political unrest and made government officials nervous . and christian groups , such as the puritans , found the theatre immoral . but there has been plenty of evidence to suggest that shakespeare did write the plays . for one , shakespeare apparently wrote plays until 1611 ; the earl of oxford died in 1601 . also , at least four different publishers put shakespeare ' s dramas to print . if he had not been the author , they would have all had to keep the secret . " the more people you had to have involved [ in the conspiracy ], the more likely it would have been that somebody would have blown the whistle ," says professor gary taylor , director of history of text technologies at florida state university . kinney and craig ' s computational method adds scientific credence to the mix . " the more different kinds of data you have pointing to the same conclusion , the more confidence you have in that conclusion ," says taylor . the team is writing a book by me , william shakespeare , which will be available in late 2007 and will contain their findings . were him more ours why i herself are own for just whom been about them to each both yourself is does through am we while did over
