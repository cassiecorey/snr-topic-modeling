putting babies to sleep on their backs allows them to respond to their arousal reflexes an abnormality in part of the brain that controls breathing , arousal and other reflexes may be what causes sudden infant death syndrome , a finding that could lead to a preventive treatment , a study says . the discovery could explain why babies lying face down are more likely to die of sids . in that position an infant ' s reflexes , including head turning and arousal , are harder to trigger when breathing is challenged , says the report from children ' s hospital boston and harvard medical school . the study , published in this week ' s journal of the american medical association , was based on autopsy data from 31 infants who had died from sids and 10 who had died from other causes between 1997 and 2005 in california . in the sids infants , a look at the lowest part of the brainstem , the medulla oblongata , found abnormalities in nerve cells that make and use serotonin , one of the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cells . serotonin and how it is processed in the brainstem may help coordinate breathing , blood pressure , sensitivity to carbon dioxide and temperature , the report says . when babies sleep face down or have their faces covered by bedding , they are thought to breathe exhaled carbon dioxide back in , depriving them of oxygen . when that happens the carbon dioxide increase would normally trigger nerve cells in the brainstem , which in turn stimulate respiratory and arousal centres in the brain . " a normal baby will wake up , turn over , and start breathing faster when carbon dioxide levels rise ," says dr hannah kinney of the boston hospital , an author of the paper . but babies with the defect die because the reflexes are impaired , she says . public health campaigns aimed at reducing the risk of sids have advised parents to put infants to sleep on their back , and to avoid soft bedding , sharing a bed with an infant , smoking during pregnancy and smoking around a baby after birth . among the sids infants in the new study , 65 % were sleeping prone or on their side at the time of death , indicating a need for continued public information on the problem , the study says . the findings may spur development of a diagnostic test to identify infants at risk , or perhaps some day a drug or other type of treatment to protect infants with abnormal brainstem serotonin systems , the authors say . " this finding lends credence to the view that sids risk may greatly increase when an underlying predisposition combines with an environmental risk , such as sleeping face down , at a developmentally sensitive time in early life ," says dr duane alexander , director of the us national institute of child health and human development , which helped to pay for the study . by down between same s down
