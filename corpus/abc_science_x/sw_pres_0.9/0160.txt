chocolate may give you short - term pleasure if you crave it . but it ' s not an antidepressant , as many people think chocoholics can happily eat chocolate for pleasure , but for those who are stressed and clinically depressed , the high is short - lived and chocolate may even deepen the downer , a review shows . the findings , which will be published in the journal of affective disorders , fly in the face of the myth that chocolate is an antidepressant . the analysis , which is the most comprehensive literature review on how chocolate affects mood , shows that the motivation behind eating chocolate determines which neurotransmitters are activated , and hence your mood . the review ' s australian authors , from the black dog institute at the prince of wales hospital in sydney , identified two groups of chocolate eaters based on motivation . they identified the cravers , who eat chocolate as an indulgent pleasure , and the emotional eaters , who use chocolate in a bid to alleviate depression . professor gordon parker , executive director of the black dog institute and lead author , says cravers see chocolate like a good glass of wine , and anticipating and eating the treat releases ' feel good ' neurotransmitters . " chocolate craving as an indulgent pleasure seems to stimulate the dopamine system in the brain , and provides an enjoyable experience ," he says . " but the emotional eaters , people who eat chocolate to relieve boredom , stress or clinical depression , are looking for an opioid effect to improve their mood ." for them , at best chocolate only provides temporary relief , he says . but this is quickly followed by a return to or a worsening of their earlier negative state . consuming sweet foods is thought to release the neurotransmitter beta - endorphin in the hypothalamus , which is said to have an opiate effect on the body . but why the chocolate high is so transient and insufficient to sustain mood in those who eat it for emotional reasons remains unknown . busting the myth the theory that chocolate acts as an antidepressant comes from the common belief that a serotonin deficiency causes chocolate cravings , but the review found no support for this hypothesis . " it is true that chocolate acts on the same neurological system as serotonin . but you ' d have to eat a truck load of chocolate before you have had the equivalent of one antidepressant tablet ," parker says . " our review rejects any possibility that chocolate desired as a way of relieving stress or when feeling down has any antidepressant benefit ." stimulants such as caffeine , theobromine , tyramine and phenylethylamine , are also present in concentrations too low to have any significant psychoactive effect , the review says . for more information about depression , including fact sheets , support
