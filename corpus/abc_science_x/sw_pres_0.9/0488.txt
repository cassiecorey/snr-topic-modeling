our moon may qualify for the title of ' planet ' if it continues to move away from the earth the proposed new definition of a planet has got scientists talking , some saying it means even our moon could one day be labelled a planet . astronomer dr charles lineweaver of the australian national university says he is generally in favour of the draft international astronomical union ( iau ) definition , but it has some potential problems . " according to the new definition of planets , our moon ... will become a planet in the future ," says lineweaver . under the draft definition , which astronomers will vote on next week in prague , a planet must orbit a star , while not being itself a star , and it must be massive enough for its own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape . under this definition , charon would no longer be a satellite of pluto . rather both would qualify as planets , of the pluton type . central to this double - planet system is a common centre of gravity , or barycentre , that exists in free space above the surface of pluto . by contrast , our moon would remain a satellite under the new definition because the barycentre of the system is located below the earth ' s surface . but lineweaver says as the moon is moving further away from the earth , this means the barycentre will one day be above earth ' s surface . " the moon will have to be about 40 % further away than it is now for it to become a planet ," he says . " based on an extrapolation of the current recession of the moon , this will happen in about 5 billion plus or minus 1 billion years ." under your will been theirs up have through nor before with
