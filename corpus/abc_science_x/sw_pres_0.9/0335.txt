restricting an infant ' s diet without a clinical diagnosis of food allergy could place him or her at risk , researchers say parents are more likely to think their infant is allergic to certain foods than is actually the case , according to a new uk study . dr taraneh dean of the university of portsmouth and her colleagues found that more than half ( 54 %) of a group of one - year - olds were avoiding some foods because their parents perceived them to have had reactions to items such as cow ' s milk , wheat , eggs or additives . but overall only 2 - 6 % of the infants had clinically confirmed food hypersensitivity , the researchers report in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology . dean and her team surveyed a group of 969 parents when their infants were three , six , nine and 12 months of age . at one year , the infants underwent skin prick testing to investigate their sensitivity to a number of allergens . during the course of the study , infants whose parents reported symptoms of food hypersensitivity had a test known as an open food challenge . if these challenges suggested food hypersensitivity , the children then underwent double - blind , placebo - controlled food challenges , which are considered the ' gold standard ' in diagnosing food hypersensitivity . at three months of age , according to parental reports , 14 % of infants had adverse reactions to food , while 7 % did by one year of age . among all the children , almost 26 % had been reported at some point by their parents to have food hypersensitivity . but open food challenges identified food hypersensitivity in just 14 %, and double - blind , placebo controlled testing confirmed it in 6 %. skin prick testing found just 2 % of the children had sensitivity to milk , egg , fish , peanut , sesame or wheat . "[ the findings ] emphasise the need for accurate diagnosis to prevent infants being on unnecessarily restricted diets , which may be associated with inadequate nutrition in this important period of growth and development ," the researchers conclude . don just very having them that doing do are ourselves be until had both herself i were my my after that same after our now him are from both having
