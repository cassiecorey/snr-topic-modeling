australia is developing the world ' s first koala sperm bank zoos around the world will soon be able to breed their own koalas without having to fly in breeding stock from australia , researchers say . they say new technology to preserve sperm will allow koala sperm to be exported from australia for the first time . university of queensland reproductive biologist and team leader dr steve johnston says the researchers have been able to extend the shelf life of the sperm to 40 hours . they ' ve done this by diluting the semen in a special ph balanced solution containing nutrients and antibiotics , and keeping it chilled . the team this week unveiled eight koala joeys born from artificial insemination with the diluted semen . being able to dilute the semen is the first step in being able to provide frozen specimens internationally and interstate , johnston says . this is because fresh koala semen only lasts a couple of hours and the fragility of the cells means they don ' t easily survive freezing and thawing . the team now plans to set up the world ' s first koala sperm bank . what do koalas and camels have in common ? johnston says koalas , like camels , have a special factor in their sperm which triggers ovulation in the female . " what we found was ... there ' s a combination between the mating itself and the factor in the semen which causes the [ brain ] to release luteinising hormone , which results in the ovulation process ," he says . diluting the semen without affecting the ovulation factor was a major challenge for researchers , he says . " diluting is a first step because if you ' re going to freeze something you have to put it into a diluent which allows you to put cryoprotectants in the fluid to protect the sperm against freezing ," he says . " the other thing is when you dilute the sperm you don ' t have to use as much , you don ' t waste as much sperm when inseminating ." low sperm count koalas have a relatively low sperm count with only about 100 million sperm per ejaculation , compared with echidnas , which have 10 times that amount . johnston says being able to send a frozen sperm sample internationally will make it easier to introduce genetic diversity to koala populations . and setting up a sperm bank will help conservation efforts in australia and enable samples to be screened for common koala diseases like chlamydia and retroviruses . but don ' t hold your breath about buying your very own koala sperm online , johnston says . " the queensland government is making sure that none of that will happen ." other why ours doing yours we yours they being each than over some i because t do their does and does about here theirs
