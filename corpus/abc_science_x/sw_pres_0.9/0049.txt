a book at bedtime doesn ' t guarantee children become better readers in the long run , researchers say . their genes play a bigger role genes , rather than reading to young children at home , have a greater influence on how they learn to read once they reach school , researchers say . the study , published in the latest issue of the journal of research in reading , is the first to demonstrate the influence of genes on potential reading ability in children younger than six . the study of pre - school age twins from australia , the us , norway and sweden followed into their early school years , found genetic variability accounted for most of the differences in skills that predicted later reading ability . these skills included understanding the sounds in words , familiarity with letters and verbal fluency . australian researcher brian byrne , professor of psychology from the university of new england in armidale , stresses that the amount of time carers spend reading to children at home is important . but the research shows the significance of supporting pre - school age children who are having difficulties with letters and words . " if a child is reading poorly in part because they are not as genetically well - endowed as other children , we know we will need to work harder and devote more resources to get them up to scratch ," says byrne . by the end of their second year at school , the australian children in the study show almost no trace of the influence of their home environment on reading ability , he says . and the influence of genetic variability actually increases as children get older , he adds . " we don ' t know which genes are involved but some of the genes in question affect brain development , maybe even embryonically . my guess is that in about five years , we will have identified a suite of actual genes that are driving this ." identifying children with problems byrne says the study highlights the importance of identifying children much earlier who might develop reading disorders , especially dyslexia . " there is evidence that early and focused intervention for potential reading disorders in children with family histories of dyslexia can lead to grade - level performance in the early school years ," he says . " our findings should act as a spur to continued research , to adoption of the best evidence - based teaching practices and to early identification of children at risk for reading disability ." is her
