light - detecting fibres could one - day be used to capture images from space move over digital cameras . imaging with special light - detecting fibres may be on its way . researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) have developed a crisscrossing web of transparent fibres that senses the direction , intensity and phase of light in 3d . it does this without lenses , filters or detector arrays typically used for the task . the lightweight fibres could be used to make space telescopes that unfurl sail - like imagers , say the scientists . alternatively , interactive computer screens made with the fibres could respond to light instead of mouse clicks . and fibres in electronic clothing could one - day sense the environment better than the wearer . " we have shown already that these very simple fibre arrays can extract images without a lens ," says yoel fink , an associate professor of materials science at mit . fink , with postdoctoral associate ayman abouraddy and colleagues , publish the results in the latest issue of the journal nature materials . in conventional imaging systems , the lens is a crucial component , as it focuses the light onto the detector surface , whether that is a light - sensitive film or computer chip . but in fink ' s system , a software algorithm does the work of the lens after light hits the photo - detecting fibres . " it ' s a completely new way of doing things ," says eli yablonovitch , professor of electrical engineering at university of california , los angeles . fibres have three elements the fibres are 1 millimetre in diameter and have three elements : a semiconducting core flanked by metal conductors , all encircled in an insulating shell of a polymer . weaving the fibres together produces a screen - like product with unique coordinates for each location where two fibres intersect . with this method , scientists can pinpoint where on the grid light is shining . placing one screen in front of another , or forming one screen into a sphere as the team did in laboratory tests , provides even more detail . light passes through a coordinate on the facing screen and through another coordinate behind . so the scientists determine where the light came from by drawing an imaginary line through the two coordinates . at the same time , the fibre is collecting information about the light , including its intensity and the frequency of the light waves . a software algorithm then calculates how the light would change if it passed through a lens and uses the answer to generate a picture of the light ' s source . light from all directions whereas conventional imaging systems have a limited field of view , fink ' s system can sense light coming from all directions . " the beauty of this is that they are able to make this three - dimensional detection and to do so with an object that is essentially transparent ," says malvin teisch , professor of physics and electrical and computing engineering at boston university . fink ' s team is working on fibres that can sense a wider range of light wavelengths , to produce colour images , as well as ones that can read heat and sound . once during yourselves by just yours i me same these on over than yourself his when between to once which was too can a from was again the will having he have other out most
