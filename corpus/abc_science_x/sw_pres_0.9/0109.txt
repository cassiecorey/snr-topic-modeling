bounty bay on pitcairn island shows the island ' s typical steep rocky shoreline the original polynesian community on the pitcairn islands died out because it lost touch with its neighbours who provided crucial resources , an australian archaeologist says . dr marshall weisler of the university of queensland will discuss his research on the reliance of pitcairn islanders on the neighbouring mangareva or gambier islanders at a conference in mexico later this year . "[ pitcairn is ] the kind of island that can only have people on it in the long run if it ' s being resourced from outside periodically ," says weisler , who has been studying pitcairn since 1990 . " it wasn ' t sustainable in the long run because the trading connections between the pitcairn group and mangareva stopped ." the uk - governed pitcairn islands , are a group of four small rugged and relatively barren islands in a remote part of the western pacific . today , they are home to a handful of descendants of fletcher christian who led the mutiny on the bounty in 1789 . the two main islands in the group are pitcairn and henderson , which were originally settled in around 800 to 900 ad , he says , by " a couple of dozen " polynesians from the neighbouring island of mangareva . but by the time the spanish explorer ferdinand queros sailed by in 1606 , the islands had been abandoned . surviving on pitcairn weisler spent several months at pitcairn to work out why . he says archaeological evidence collected suggests early pitcairn inhabitants ate seafood and seabirds such as the booby , and used earth ovens to cook . he says they put a fair bit of pressure on the islands ' resources . for example , some species of land birds went extinct during the occupation . through any she his she how this be if or me she our with now at such until down until am nor itself such
