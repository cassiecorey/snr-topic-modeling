the way your gut microbes digest food could influence your body weight , scientists say bacteria in your gut may determine whether you are skinny or obese , according to scientists who say that food , exercise and genetics may not be the only things to influence body weight . us scientists have discovered that levels of two types of good bacteria in the gut that help to break down foods are different in obese and lean people and mice . the finding , reported today in the journal nature , could lead to a better understanding of why some people may be prone to obesity and help find new ways of preventing or treating it . " our gut microbial structure should be considered when understanding the elements that might regulate our energy balance and may predispose us to obesity ," says professor jeffrey gordon , of the washington university school of medicine in st louis . " there is something very startling about the amount of fat you have and the structure of your gut microbial community ," he adds . there are trillions of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract , but two groups called the bacteroidetes and the firmicutes are the most dominant and their proportion varies in lean and obese mice and humans . the scientists found that the proportion of bacteroidetes bacteria is lower in obese mice and people than in lean people . but when gordon and his team studied 12 obese people who followed low - calorie diets for a year , they found their levels of bacteroidetes rose as their weight decreased . " they increased as the weight is lost and in proportion to the amount of weight loss ," says gordon . the results suggest that there may be a microbial component to obesity . but scientists do not yet know if people start out with lower levels of bacteroidetes or firmicutes that may make them prone to obesity . " these are things we are exploring now . what are the signals between the amount of fat and different groups of bacteria that exist in the gut ," says gordon . university of cincinnati researchers , writing in an accompanying commentary in the journal , say : " this is a potentially revolutionary idea that could change our views of what causes obesity and how we depend on the bacteria that inhabit our gut . but a great deal remains poorly understood ." their no are any ourselves more most him such very when most i were my how on at more an under are on over about for them during all
