the last human chromosome to be sequenced , chromosome 1 , is the biggest and contains the most genes scientists have reached a landmark point in one of the world ' s most important scientific projects by sequencing the last chromosome in the human genome . chromosome 1 contains nearly twice as many genes as the average chromosome and makes up 8 % of the human genetic code . it is packed with 3141 genes and linked to 350 illnesses including cancer , alzheimer ' s and parkinson ' s disease , according to a report today in the journal nature . " this achievement effectively closes the book on an important volume of the human genome project ," says dr simon gregory who headed the sequencing project at the uk ' s sanger institute . the project started in 1990 to identify the genes and dna sequences that provide a blueprint for human beings . chromosome 1 is the biggest and contains , per chromosome , the greatest number of genes . " therefore it is the region of the genome to which the greatest number of diseases have been localised ," adds gregory . the sequence of chromosome 1 took an international team of 150 scientists 10 years to complete . researchers around the world will be able to mine the data to improve diagnostics and treatments for cancers , autism , mental disorders and other illnesses . final chapter the human genome has about 20 , 000 to 25 , 000 genes and the sequencing of chromosome 1 has led to the identification of more than 1000 new ones . " we are moving into the next phase which will be working out what the genes do and how they interact ," says gregory . the genetic map of chromosome 1 has already been used to identify a gene for a common form of cleft lip and palate . it will also improve understanding of what processes lead to genetic diversity in populations , gregory says . the scientists also identified 4500 new snps , single nucleotide polymorphisms , variations in human dna that make people unique . snps contain clues about why some people are susceptible to diseases like cancer or malaria , the best way to diagnose and treat them and how they will respond to drugs . the how same should at they not few yourselves after are am under did very a our off their will through all as an through further were not
