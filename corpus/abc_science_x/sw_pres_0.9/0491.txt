could the hobbit really be one of us after all ? a new paper has inflamed the debate over the hobbit ' s origins , with one researcher criticising the scientific journal that published the research . a paper in today ' s issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science ( pnas ) is the second this year to conclude that the hobbit is just a sick human . indonesian researcher professor teuku jacob , from gadjah mada university , and an international team argue that the hobbit is a microcephalic pygmy rather than a new species of hominid . " all the odd things about it aren ' t things which indicate another species ," says co - author and anatomist dr alan thorne , a visiting fellow at the australian national university . " it happens to be an individual [ human ] with major , probably genetic , deformities ." thorne says the team reached its conclusions by comparing 140 anatomical features of the hobbit specimens with those of human specimens . he says none of these features were outside the normal range for humans , in particular australomelanesians , which is his research speciality . thorne says previous comparisons of the hobbit had been with inappropriate western european populations . study and journal criticised but two of the original australian discoverers of the hobbit , professor peter brown and professor mike morwood from the university of new england , have lashed out at the researchers , rejecting arguments put forward in the latest paper . brown also criticises the journal itself for publishing the research . brown says the paper ' s conclusions are " unsupported by any published evidence " and that the paper makes " misleading comments " about previously published papers . australian national university taxonomist professor colin groves , who was not involved in the research , also rejects the pnas paper . " most of their claims of pathology are not substantial ," says groves , who has a paper due out in the journal of human evolution rejecting the microcephaly theory . unethical conduct ? brown says putting aside the scientific argument itself , pnas should not have published the research because of what he says is the research team ' s " unethical scientific practice ", a claim the authors reject . one of the sticking points is whether correct permission was obtained to study the precious hobbit bones . the pnas article states that the researchers were permitted to study the hobbit materials in accordance with a research agreement between the indonesian national research centre of archaeology and the university of new england . but brown and morwood say the researchers breached the agreement by removing the material from the archaeology centre in jakarta before the australian researchers had managed to complete their analysis . it was removed without the agreement of both parties and without any conditions for proper credit , says morwood . brown is also critical that thorne had a flight to indonesia paid for by an australian tv company to examine the material . but thorne says there ' s nothing improper about this . " the fact that my fares were paid by a television company is simply a function of the fact that i ' m now retired and someone wants to pay my airfares i ' m not going to knock it back ," he says . brown also says the material was damaged beyond repair while being studied . thorne says he didn ' t see the material after it was returned from jacob ' s lab but when he saw it , it was in fine condition . scientists behaving badly or a misunderstanding ? overall , brown thinks the conduct of the pnas authors amounts to bad behaviour . " i can ' t think of a more extreme example of unethical scientific practice ," says brown , " for pnas to reward their behaviour casts aspersions on the journal ." thorne says he doesn ' t understand the claim . he says he was invited to look at the material by jacob , whom thorne had met many times over his decades of research in indonesia . " there was nothing unethical about that at all ," he says , adding that the pnas paper had five referees , including experts in anatomy , pathology , growth and development . journal stands by its paper a spokesperson for the journal confirms the article was peer - reviewed prior to submission and also by a member of the pnas editorial board before being accepted for publication . pnas declined to comment on brown ' s allegations , instead referring abc science online ' s questions to the study authors . more ours has them doing with other once by not s up in against just why but that than
