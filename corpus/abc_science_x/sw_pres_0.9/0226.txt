gm cotton fights back against the helicoverpa armigera caterpillar . but this transgenic cotton has its drawbacks , say some scientists ( see related stories below ) research that led to genetically modified cotton , australia ' s first transgenic broadacre crop , has been awarded a prestigious award . three csiro scientists were last night presented with an atse clunies ross award for their work on bt cotton . they were among researchers in the fields of environmental science , metallurgy , information technology and physics to be presented with an award , in recognition of their " outstanding achievements in the application of science and technology for the social and economic benefit of australia ". csiro ' s plant molecular biologist dr danny llewellyn , plant breeder and agronomist dr greg constable and entomologist dr gary fitt were awarded jointly for their work in combating the moth helicoverpa armigera , the most destructive pest to broadacre crops . csiro licensed a gene from us biotechnology company monsanto that produced a toxin from the bacteria bacillus thuringiensis or bt . the researchers then introduced the gene into australian cotton plants . when the h . armigera caterpillar eats the transgenic cotton plant , the toxin attaches to its gut and poisons it . this alternative approach to pest management has reduced the use of chemical pesticides by 90 %, saving farmers about a $ 180 million a year on spraying , the researcher say . " it used to cost a $ 200 million annually to spray cotton crops with pesticide to control the moth but now they only use about 10 % of the insecticide they used to use ," says constable , the team leader . " the main issue was insecticide could contaminate land , air and water so this is safer for the environment and everyone as it only kills the moth , without harming other helpful insects , creatures or humans ." other award winners were : * environmental scientist dean cameron from biolytix technologies in brisbane for developing a waste treatment system that uses worms , beetles and microscopic organisms to recycle sewage and household waste into safe irrigation water and compost . * professor ron sacks - davis from melbourne information technology company inquirion , which creates information retrieval and text database management programs that searches tens of millions of pages per second . the programs have been used by us and australian intelligence agencies for antiterrorism purposes and for drafting legislation * perth metallurgist dr gerald roach from alcoa world alumna for reducing the cost of alumina production , environmental impacts and energy use and improving product quality . his research improving ore extraction efficiency has reduced bauxite waste by hundreds of thousands of tonnes annually . * a lifetime achievement award was presented to perth physicist emeritus professor dr john de laeter , ao , whose career began as a high school teacher . he was instrumental in developing five research centres in western australia , and in raising a $ 28 million for the scientific community and research . former clunies ross award winner , joint winner of the 2005 nobel prize in physiology or medicine professor barry marshall , who discovered that the bacteria helicobacter pylori , rather than stress , causes stomach ulcers , was guest speaker at the awards ceremony . all her his me too under doing while and on who that a he will when be
