the galaxy cluster abell 2029 is composed of thousands of galaxies , shown in this xray image , and an amount of dark matter equivalent to more than a hundred trillion suns dark matter particles are zooming around the universe a million times faster than anyone predicted , uk astronomers say . they ' ve calculated that this mysterious substance , which governs how stars and galaxies move , is moving at a speedy 9 kilometres per second . the university of cambridge researchers have also worked out how dark matter likes to clump together and surprising details of how hot it is , data essential in modelling how galaxies form . a preliminary report is available on arxiv , the online website operated by cornell university . dark matter is mysterious because it doesn ' t emit radiation , making it difficult to spot . indeed , no - one has detected it and not all scientists are convinced it exists . " the best evidence for dark matter is that there are stars in our sky ," says professor gilmore , director of the institute of astronomy at cambridge , which made the latest calculations . " without it they ' d be flying off into space ." dark matter is the mass needed to hold stars in their given places as they move around galaxies ; the faster they move the more mass is needed . " kepler and newton were able to weigh the sun just by knowing where earth was and how fast it was moving ," says gilmore . " we did the same thing , only in three dimensions , finding the ' weight ' of dark matter by measuring the place and speed of a very large number stars in several dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way ." hanging out in clumps the results were surprising . aside from their speed , the researchers calculated the smallest clump of dark matter that could exist , 1000 light - years across . these results imply that dark matter is hotter than predicted , meaning that what astronomers call ' cold ' dark matter may not be so cold after all . at 10 , 000 & deg ; c it ' s still cool by astronomical standards . but it ' s warm enough to solve two problems that have plagued standard models of how galaxies form : that there are too few dwarf galaxies and why dark matter has not concentrated in the centre of galaxies . gilmore says he was initially wary of the results , which together seemed too simple to be plausible . the discovery of a super - dim galaxy by dr beth willman from new york university , gave the team an opportunity to successfully test its predictions . these if of can each on both no being very is in that on some now between was me both same a there your out what where
