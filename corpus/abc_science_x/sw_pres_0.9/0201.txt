graffiti is the modern equivalent of cave art , an expert says . both are produced by young men with adrenaline and sex on their minds testosterone - fuelled boys created most prehistoric cave art , according to a book by one of the world ' s authorities on this type of art . the theory contradicts the idea that adult , tribal shaman spiritual leaders and healers produced virtually all of it . it also explains why many of the images drawn in caves during the pleistocene , between 10 , 000 and 35 , 000 years ago , somewhat mirror today ' s artwork and graffiti , largely produced by adolescent males . " today , boys draw the testosterone subjects of a hot automobile , fighter jet , jedi armour , sports , direct missile hit , etc - all of the things they associate with the adrenaline of success ," says professor r dale guthrie , author of the nature of paleolithic art . " i think the full larder [ of ] success of the excitement and danger of killing a giant bison or auroch in the pleistocene was the equivalent of the testosterone art today ," says guthrie , who is an emeritus professor in the institute of arctic biology at the university of alaska fairbanks . he says that many of the cave art images of animals are rather graphic , showing , for example , speared animals with blood pouring out of their mouths and noses . but hunting and animals were not the only things on the cave artists ' minds . guthrie has also noticed that males were drawn with no defined sexual parts save for a simple line designating the penis . few men were even represented , but the images of women in caves tell a different story . " female images dominate and are nude , almost every one full - figured above and below ," says guthrie . " unlike the other animals , the sculpted , engraved and painted human females and female parts are sometimes done schematically , distilling and inflating the primary and secondary sex characters ." learning to draw guthrie also determines that several cave art images are incomplete , overlapping , brief and rudimentary , as though the people who created them were still learning to draw . this type of sketching dominates cave walls , which also display a handful of works that appear to have been drawn by well - practiced artists , who were probably adults . perhaps the most convincing piece of evidence for the new theory consists of 200 handprints that were left in the caves next to the art . these prints were produced by people who chewed ochre , held up a hand , and then spit the colorful orange - yellow spew all over the hand , leaving a wall imprint . guthrie analysed the handprints and then compared the results with earlier research on male and female hands . the hand lengths , palm widths and the finger widths and lengths mostly match hands that would have belonged to boys aged nine to 17 . some teen female handprints were identified in the caves , but young male prints were more common . other handprints resulting unintentionally from people leaning against muddy cave walls , as well as footprints , also suggest that young boys were creating the cave art , according to guthrie . paul martin , professor of quaternary biogeography at the university of arizona , says he is inclined to agree with the new theory and findings . "[ guthrie ] has an extraordinary knowledge of wild animal ecology globally , and especially in the northern hemisphere ," martin says . " in addition , he brings detailed knowledge of late pleistocene fossils to his study of cave art . finally , like many zoologists , especially those with children of their own , he is an astute observer of human behaviour . " if he finds that much cave art reflects teenage or preteen preoccupations , i am prepared to believe him ," he says . were below are in most over we same on whom yourselves at been such the the do
