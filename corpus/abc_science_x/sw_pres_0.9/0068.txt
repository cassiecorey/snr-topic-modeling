a new type of pulsar that spits out radio waves intermittently , rather than regularly , has been discovered scientists have discovered a strange new type of pulsar that emits intermittent bursts of radio waves . and there are lots of them out there . in a paper in the journal nature today , an international team of astronomers estimates there could be up to half a million of these weird flashing ' dead ' stars . the scientists are calling them rrats , or rotating radio transients . unlike ordinary pulsars , which can emit regular pulses of radio waves , rrats emit short millisecond bursts of radio waves in between dark spells that may last several hours . this makes them very difficult to find , says co - author dr dick manchester , from csiro ' s australia telescope national facility , who has been hunting pulsars with the parkes radio telescope for the past seven years . " these things are so sporadic that most searches , like the survey we conducted , would have missed them . we only looked at each patch of the sky for 35 minutes so we were lucky to find any ," he says . " this means there must be a huge population out there , many more than ordinary pulsars ." while there are about 100 , 000 ordinary pulsars in the milky way , astronomers estimate there are at least 400 , 000 rrats . this latest research could mean that scientists will have to come up with new ideas for the way so many rrats have formed . birth of a pulsar pulsars are believed to be formed in supernovae , the cataclysmic explosion that signals the end of the life of a massive star . as the core collapses to a superdense neutron star it spins very rapidly , sending a beam of radiation that sweeps out like a searchlight . if the beam is pointing towards earth each ' pulse ' can be detected , hence the name pulsar . " we knew that rrats were pulsars , even though the pulses were isolated , just a single burst and then they might shut up for an hour or two ," says manchester . " but it was only by timing them over a four year period that it was realised that they had much longer periods than normal and that they were slowing down ." magnetic , reborn or just plain weird ? the paper suggests that rrats are young super magnetic pulsars barely 100 , 000 years old . but manchester is not ruling out the possibility that they may be ' zombies ', old pulsars suddenly brought back to life by growing magnetic fields or ordinary pulsars radiating in an unusual way . " that ' s what makes it exciting ," he says . " there are so many possibilities ." ourselves who am each until this then her other t what such own herself and and about your me been into theirs yourselves before of being s off doing them now ours
