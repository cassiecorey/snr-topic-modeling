recurrent miscarriages could be prevented if women prone to thrombophilia are given the correct treatment , new research finds women who have had recurrent miscarriages should be checked for a tendency to develop blood clots as treating the condition halves their risk of further pregnancy loss , a new study has found . australian researchers followed 220 couples who had had at least three miscarriages . they found that screening the women for thrombophilia , a tendency to develop blood clots , and giving them prophylactic anti - thrombotic therapy halved their future chances of losing a pregnancy . professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the university of adelaide , gus dekker , says the women were screened for thrombophilia , insulin resistance and elevated homocysteine levels . " we found that if you do nothing , these women can expect a 30 % to 35 % chance of a further miscarriage ," he says . " but if you treat them , the pregnancy loss rate is halved to 15 %. there is light on the horizon for women who have recurrent miscarriages as proper analysis and treatment can increase the chance of having a healthy baby from 70 % to 85 %." anti - thrombotic therapy includes aspirin plus low molecular weight heparin . treatment for elevated levels of homocysteine , which is another risk factor for clotting , is vitamins including folate and vitamin b12 . professor dekker presented findings at the recent human reproductive health through the ages conference in adelaide . he says the data , literature and the researchers ' own experience indicate that screening identified major risk factors in 50 - 60 % of recurrent miscarriage cases . " we can modify most of these risk factors such as insulin resistance and thrombophilias ," he says . he advises these women should be referred to an obstetrician with a special interest in the area . dekker says women who had had three miscarriages or women in their mid - 30s who had had two , and did not have a condition known as a blighted ovum , could be referred . women with a personal or family history of thrombophilia could also be referred , as could women with a history of pre - eclampsia or unexplained preterm birth . " most thrombophilias affect the early development of the placental circulation so treatment to prevent thrombosis and possibly provide an anti - inflammatory effect , can stop the process ," he says
