the future is nuclear , says a new report into australia ' s rich uranium resources new nuclear technology will cut waste so significantly that we may no longer need to dump it underground , according to an australian government report . the report , tabled in parliament this week , also says australia should lift restrictions on uranium exploration , mining and export because at present nuclear power is the only " reliable and proven " way of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . " advanced nuclear reactors and spent fuel reprocessing technologies are now being developed which will significantly reduce the quantity and toxicity of nuclear waste ," says the report , australia ' s uranium - greenhouse friendly fuel for an energy hungry world . " these technological advances could potentially obviate the need for geological repositories altogether ." the new generation of reactors could also reduce the isolation period needed for waste to " just a few hundred years ". but dr mark diesendorf of the institute of environmental studies at the university of new south wales , has dismissed these comments as " propaganda for the nuclear industry ". he says the 440 nuclear reactors operating around the world today are " almost identical " to those of 25 years ago . " this is speculation about future reactors that are not on the market ," he says of comments made in the report . reducing waste nuclear waste consists of spent uranium , plutonium and other by - products , which critics like diesendorf say needs to be managed for up to hundreds of thousands of years . professor stephen lincoln , an expert in nuclear energy and uranium from the university of adelaide , says it ' s possible to recycle some of this waste by turning it into a mixed uranium - plutonium oxide , or mox . " so instead of just using uranium oxide in the fuel rods you use mixed uranium and plutonium . that burns up the plutonium but it also produces nuclear power ," he says . professor leslie kemeny , australian foundation member of the international nuclear energy academy and a consultant nuclear physicist , says three reactors around the world are already using this so - called mox . kemeny says we ' ll also get better at developing ways of using waste from nuclear reactors , not only as an energy source but for use in industry and hospitals . " i firmly believe ... everything that is taken out of the reactor core to be put into a waste depository is highly valuable ," he says . improving safety kemeny says new technology will not only cut back waste , but will make nuclear reactors safer . he says pebble - bed reactors are being developed that package the uranium in graphite balls rather than iron rods , making waste easier to handle . " with the generation iv reactors you will go for a fuel element that is enriched particles of uranium interspersed with silicon and carbon in a small ball or hexagonal shaped fuel element ," he says . " you can circulate these balls in and out of the reactor or just drop in a set of orange - sized or tennis ball - sized and take out ones that have been there a long time ." and because pebble - bed reactors are cooled by gas like helium or carbon dioxide they reduce the risk of overheating and a chernobyl - style meltdown , he says . but deisendorf says according to his calculations pebble - bed reactors would produce 13 times more nuclear waste than conventional ones . " you don ' t have rods but you have 13 times the quantity of nuclear waste because you ' re embedding the fuel in pebbles , and the pebbles occupy a lot of volume and it all becomes highly radioactive ," he says . lincoln says while pebble bed rectors are " fine in principle ", none are currently being used to generate power and the fuel is more expensive to produce . " when you bring in any new technology it ' s got to be proved and tested and the final analysis is , is it commercially competitive in terms of producing electricity by comparison with the currently used reactors ?" he says . lincoln says no degree of technological sophistication will ensure 100 % safety at nuclear reactors and adds it ' s difficult to imagine a reactor so advanced that it produces no waste at all . " it ' s true that modern reactors are better in that respect , they produce less waste . but they ' re always going to produce it ," he says . " it ' s still quite a significant issue because at this point in time there is not one single permanent storage for high - level nuclear waste ." is ours very with while because about between more
