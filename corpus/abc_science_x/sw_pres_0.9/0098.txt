an acidic burp can give you heartburn symptoms reflux doesn ' t have to be extremely acidic to give you that burning feeling , a new study shows . in fact , burping can result in heartburn even when no liquid accompanies the gas up the oesophagus , dutch researchers report . dr aj bredenoord and colleagues from st antonius hospital in nieuwegein , the netherlands , report their findings in the latest issue of the journal gut . the researchers monitored 32 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease , or gerd , who had stopped taking their acid - suppressing medication . they were monitored for 24 hours using traditional ph testing as well as a technique called impedance . impedance allows researchers to evaluate how far reflux extends up from the stomach , measure the volume of reflux , and evaluate acidity with greater precision . " it ' s a completely new way of looking at reflux ," bredenoord says . the acid test there were 1807 episodes of reflux , 203 of them causing symptoms . episodes that caused symptoms showed a larger increase in acidity within the oesophagus , more acidity , and extended further up the oesophagus . the volume of reflux in heartburn - causing episodes was larger than for those that caused no symptoms , while the liquid also took longer to clear from the oesophagus . nearly 15 % of reflux episodes were caused by more weakly acidic reflux material . just gas the researchers also identified 426 gas - only reflux episodes , 12 of which caused symptoms . symptoms were more likely with gas reflux if they were accompanied by a rise in acidity . "[ the findings show that ] if you only focus on looking at whether these symptoms are related to acid , you will certainly miss a few patients who symptoms are also related to weakly acid reflux ," bredenoord says . and volume of reflux , as well as its acidity , plays a role in whether it causes symptoms , he adds . new drugs he points out that some drug companies are developing medications designed to reduce the number of reflux episodes , rather than targeting acidity , as all currently available gerd drugs do . this could be helpful for the minority of patients whose symptoms are due to more weakly acid reflux , he says . for more information on heartburn and reflux , see the consumer information section of the gastroenterological society of australia website . me ourselves a have
