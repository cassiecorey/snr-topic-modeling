anger and hostility may affect hormones that in turn disrupt the immune system , causing chronic lung inflammation angry and hostile middle - aged men suffer accelerated wear and tear of their lungs , a new us study shows . in 1986 , harvard school of public health doctors recruited 670 men aged 45 - 86 , with the average age of 62 . the researchers assessed the doctors ' hostility using a yardstick test called the cook - medley scale and their lung power , determined by the volume of air expelled in a second . the volunteers were tested three times over the next 8 . 2 years on average . after filtering out factors that could distort the result , such as smoking and education , the researchers found that the men ' s hostility rating was closely linked to lung capacity . they reported the results in the journal thorax . those who became more hostile suffered a more rapid decline in lung power than counterparts whose temperament remained unchanged or became more positive . every point increase in hostility was associated with a loss of 9 millilitres in the air expulsion test . previous research has linked hostility and anger with heart disease , asthma , hypertension , irritable bowel syndrome and other disorders , although the exact causes are unclear . one theory is that anger and hostility affect hormone processes that in turn disrupt the immune system , causing chronic inflammation that damages tissue . but dr peter lehrer of the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey says that an association between hostility and lung function does not necessarily equate to cause . " personality , as well as physiology , can change over time , and deterioration in health and physical function can lead to negative emtions as well as vice versa , including for respiratory disease
