compounds isolated from mangoes could be used to treat metabolic disorders , early research suggests a mango a day may one day protect against diabetes and high cholesterol , a preliminary study suggests . the study is analysing how individual components of the luscious summer favourite affect human cells . and early results , presented at the australian health and medical research congress in melbourne this week , suggest that some mango components act on the same pathways that diabetes and cholesterol drugs target . university of queensland phd student ashley wilkinson says the study , the first of its kind , aims to find unique ingredients in mangoes and other tropical fruit like paw paws . " there ' s been a lot of research looking at nutritional bioactives but it ' s focused on more temperate fruit and vegetables like broccoli and grapes . and there hasn ' t been any research looking at tropical fruit in the context of looking at modulating cellular processes ," she says . dr sarah roberts - thomson of the university ' s school of pharmacy , who is supervising the work , says early results suggest some compounds in mangoes work by activating or inhibiting groups of receptors known as peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors , or ppars . " we don ' t know yet how the whole thing ' s going to play out but we know some of the individual components activate these receptors or even inhibit them ," she says . " that could end up with positive nutritional health benefits for diabetes and high cholesterol ." ppars are also increasingly being linked to colon and breast cancer , and the study will investigate whether compounds in mangoes can also kill cancerous cells . one of the compounds the researchers are focusing on is quercetin , a chemical also found in onions . another is norathyriol , a by - product of mangiferin , which is found in a range of fruits and traditional antidiabetic herbs . gut bacteria convert mangiferin into norathyriol , wilkinson says . once converted , it appears to have an even more potent affect on ppars . preliminary findings also suggest that mango skin , often a component of mango juice , is particularly rich in these compounds , roberts - thomson says . a long way down the track these compounds could be isolated to form alternative treatments for metabolic disorders like diabetes and high cholesterol , she says . the study is being conducted with the queensland department of primary industries . down just s our to up about by there then ourselves what of should some a for when all after themselves my been over theirs between further them no be
