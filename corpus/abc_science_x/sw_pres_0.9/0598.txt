an active galaxy with a supermassive black hole near its centre spewing out matter across the cosmos our cosmic neighbourhood is flush with supermassive black holes busily devouring nearby stars and other matter , say scientists who have unveiled the first complete census of black hole activity in the local universe . the survey , which took nine months of observations with nasa ' s swift satellite , was presented at a recent american astronomical society meeting in san francisco . the survey uncovered more than 200 supermassive black holes within 400 million light - years of earth , says dr jack tueller with nasa ' s goddard space flight center . these objects , also known as active galactic nuclei or agn , are millions or even billions times as large as the sun and occupy a region of space about the size of our solar system . as they gobble up nearby matter , the black holes generate x - rays and many other forms of energy . other black holes also spew out jets of particles , which a related research project has determined are made up of protons and electrons . despite their violent activity , many agn are obscured by surrounding gas and dust . swift , a satellite whose main mission is to track gamma - ray bursts , spends its off - hours scanning the sky for high - powered x - rays . this radiation can be detected despite light - absorbing material that often hides the black holes . " it ' s hard to believe the whole sky is peppered with black holes ," says university of maryland researcher dr craig markwardt . scientists know that nearly every massive galaxy , including our own milky way , has a supermassive black hole near its centre . but they do not know why only a few percent appear to be actively consuming matter . most black holes , including our own , are dormant and were not surveyed in the swift census . but those black holes that are active play a key role in the universe . the survey will help scientists understand one of the fundamental processes by which energy is distributed in the universe . " you can ' t understand the universe without understanding black holes ," says dr richard mushotzky , also with nasa ' s goddard centre . " perhaps as much as 20 % of all of the radiated energy in the universe arises in one way or another from agn activity ." high - energy jets another phenomenon of black holes is the jetting of highly energetic particles , which are commonly seen radiating from quasars and other objects at nearly the speed of light . scientists have long debated whether the long streams , which can flow for hundreds of thousands of light - years across the sky , contain electrons , their antimatter partners positrons , or a mix of electrons and protons . new research concludes the streams are made up of protons and electrons . the jets are believed to be one of the primary methods for redistributing matter and energy in the universe . " black hole jets are one of the great paradoxes in astronomy ," says nasa ' s dr rita sambruna , also with goddard . " how is it that black holes , so efficient at pulling matter in , can also accelerate matter away at near light speed ? we still don ' t know how these jets form . but at least we now have a solid idea about what they ' re made of ." have such s t can where on at who yours is where him once while an hers being or can did from of this a you than himself over again its them ourselves our
