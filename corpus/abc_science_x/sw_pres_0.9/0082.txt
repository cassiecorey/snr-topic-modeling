leaves with jagged edges like these maple leaves allow better uptake of nutrients at the start of the growing season , when temperatures are cooler leaves with ' toothed ' edges help trees , shrubs and other plants cope with the cold , us researchers say . and studying leaves from ancient and existing plants could help to reveal past and present climates , they say in the current isssue of the international journal of plant sciences . they say these climates are critical for determining periods of global warming and other profound temperature changes . dr dana royer , who authored the study with dr peter wilf at pennsylvania state university , says that the jagged , pointy edges on leaves are packed with xylem , a tissue that transports water and nutrients in sap . most of the liquid evaporates by leaving the teeth through minuscule pores . " in the springtime when leaves are just starting to leaf out , leaves with teeth are , on average , losing more water than leaves without teeth ," says royer , now an assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences at wesleyan university . " this loss of water helps pull more sap up from the roots . thus trees with toothed leaves probably have a higher rate of sap flow early in the spring than toothless leaves . " this is important because it delivers nutrients to the developing leaves , helping to ' jumpstart ' their photosynthetic season . as you move to colder and colder climates with shorter and shorter growing seasons , it becomes increasingly beneficial to have teeth ," he adds . what transpires ? the researchers measured such moisture evaporation , or transpiration , and photosynthesis activity for leaves on 60 woody species from two regions with differing climates : pennsylvania and north carolina . they determined that both energy - gathering activity and transpiration increased at jagged leaf edges by up to 45 % during the first 30 days of the spring growing season . leaves without teeth did not exhibit such a marked increase . the scientists also found that plants native to colder climates , like those in pennsylvania ' s south central york county , had toothy edges that were especially active . but possessing teeth may not always be advantageous for leaves since the teeth also promote more water loss . plants in drier regions seem to be better off if they have fewer teeth or are toothless . not everyone agrees another theory , proposed by taylor field at taylor university , holds that leaf teeth serve as a sort of ' release valve ' that prevents too much sap from collecting in the leaf . professor judith totman parrish , dean of the college of science at the university of idaho , says she thinks the jury is still out on why plants have leaf teeth . " i think the authors have identified a very interesting problem and have made progress toward trying to answer it . as to whether this is the ultimate answer , that remains to be seen with further studies , but the authors have kicked off a promising line of research ," parrish says . royer says the research is important because " we on earth today are experiencing rapid climate change . a problem with trying to understand our current climate change is that it is an unreplicated experiment ". more up after their why any off of for or me him a or to them nor both same were this its as
