designers and engineers are sharing information online about how to build a better car , free from patents and profit margins the open source movement responsible for software like linux and the browser firefox is proving contagious . now a german entrepreneur is applying the same approach to designing a car . former bmw employee markus merz , who now owns an automobile consulting firm in dingolfing , germany , calls his project oscar , shorthand for open source car . the idea behind open source development is to allow anyone to copy , modify and redistribute ordinarily secret information about a technology without paying royalties to the original developers . the project , which merz calls his hobby , is bringing together automobile engineers , designers and other experts on online forums to exchange ideas on how to improve mobility , specifically car design . the hope is that , unrestrained by patents and other conventional restrictions such as profit margin , marketing and technology , a community of experts will come up with fresh solutions . " we [ usually work ] in front of the computer to generate stuff that people in front of a computer will use . it ' s boring ," says merz . " it would be a great idea to combine the idea of open source with the idea of hardware , and a car is hardware that is interesting ." designers share ideas online a website serves as headquarters for the concept car . participants interact according to a few simple rules about performance specifications . for example , the car will be about 4 metres long and 2 metres wide , and will have four doors . it will be powered by electricity and have a maximum speed of about 150 kilometres per hour . participants discuss their ideas on online forums organised into four main topics : integration , which includes design , package and distribution ; modules , which includes discussion of the body , engine and safety systems ; tools , which includes conversations about computer - aided design tools and simulations ; and network , where participants discuss potential partnerships . a group of technicians heads each forum to ensure that the best ideas are moved forward to computer modelling and testing . from there , anyone , including car manufacturers , will be encouraged to build the car . there will be no patents , and no proprietary data . " the most effective tool you can have to get anything done is passion and creativity and that needs to be unleashed , and then it ' s much more powerful than money ," says lukas neckerman , head of automotive business development at a financial services company in munich . oscar is also a hobby for neckermann , who is responsible for communications . encouraging creativity mechanical engineer achim schillak agrees that people have a desire to contribute their ideas to innovative projects , and if they can ' t do that in their current occupation , they will find another outlet . schillak wrote a case study about oscar while he was studying business management at new york university . but he believes that there are some limitations applying the open source approach to cars . " after design studies and calculations , you have to build a prototype and crash test it and that is a major difference to developing some software ," says schillak . and oscar is not set up to build the car . but merz has faith that any of several small auto manufacturers could eventually take the concept to its 3d form . " the greatest success for me would be if i can ride in this car ," says merz . until should from being yourselves against our themselves into both in each do yours here has after itself having not a
