this komodo dragon was a ' virgin birth ' at london zoo recently . another batch is expected at chester zoo this christmas flora , a pregnant komodo dragon living in a uk zoo , is expecting eight babies in what scientists say could be a christmas virgin birth . flora has never mated , or even mixed , with a male dragon , and fertilised all the eggs herself , a process culminating in parthenogenesis , or virgin birth . " nobody in their wildest dreams expected this . but you have a female dragon on her own . she produces a clutch of eggs and those eggs turn out to be fertile . it is nature finding a way ," says kevin buley of chester zoo . he says the incubating eggs could hatch around christmas . parthenogenesis has occurred in other lizard species , but buley and his team says this is the first time it has been shown in komodo dragons , the world ' s largest lizards . scientists at the university of liverpool discovered flora had had no male help after doing genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being put in an incubator . the tests on the embryos and on flora , her sister and other dragons confirmed that komodo dragons can reproduce through self - fertilisation . " those genetic tests confirmed absolutely that flora was both the mother and the father of the embryos . it completely blew us away because it [ parthenogenesis ] has never been seen in such a large species ," buley says . a komodo dragon at london zoo gave birth earlier this year after being separated from males for more than two years . scientists thought she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male . but after hearing about flora ' s eggs , researchers conducted tests that showed her eggs were also produced without male help . " you have two institutions within a few short months of each other having a previously unheard of event . it is really quite unprecedented ," says buley . the scientists , reporting the discovery today in the journal nature , say it could help them understand how reptiles colonise new areas . a female dragon could , for instance , swim to another island and establish a new colony on her own . " the genetics of self - fertilisation in lizards means that all her hatchlings would have to be male . these would grow up to mate with their own mother and therefore , within one generation , there would potentially be a population able to reproduce normally on the new island ," buley says . is yours yourselves her again himself by most of for my should his himself between our who that myself
