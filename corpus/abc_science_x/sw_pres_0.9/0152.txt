the technique may one - day be used to search earthquake rubble for survivors , the researchers say a laser - like beam of light shone at a unique solid makes the material appear to disappear , according to a new study . the effect , reported in a recent issue of the journal nature materials , occurs at infrared light wavelengths , so it can ' t be seen with the human eye . "[ but ] if it worked in the visible light with molecules that make up your hand , when the laser hit your hand , your hand would go transparent ," says team member professor chris phillips , a physicist at imperial college london . " and then if you turned the laser up a little more , the scene you ' d see through your hand would become brighter ," as the effect amplifies light in the beam , he says . phillips and his colleagues from the university of neuch & acirc ; tel , switzerland , think the method could one day work in visible light and lead to new technologies that help see through rubble to search for victims at a disaster site or observe internal body parts obscured by bone . the scientists accomplished their feat with materials used to make semiconductor chips . normally , electrons that make up atoms in these materials interact with light beams in a benign way . but phillips and his team re - engineered the material to contain artificial atoms , specially patterned crystals a few billionths of a metre long . because the atoms are artificial , the scientists could adjust the activity of the electrons , which have wavelike characteristics . when the light beam was shone onto the material , it influenced the wavelike patterns of the electrons inside the artificial atoms so that they cancelled each other out and created a new , transparent material that was half matter and half light . the scientists went on to amplify the light beam , even though 80 % of the artificial atoms stayed in a state of so - called low excitation . this contradicts a theory posed by albert einstein that says in order to amplify the light in a laser beam , the majority of the atoms must be in state of high excitation . " they have shown this can now be implemented in a solid - state medium , which could be very important for more practical applications ," says lene vestergaard hau , professor of applied physics at harvard university . in the future , the researchers aim to become better at controlling and amplifying the light beam so that they may not need a specially patterned structure to make the see -
