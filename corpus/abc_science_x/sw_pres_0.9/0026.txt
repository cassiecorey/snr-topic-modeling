vikings are continuing to surprise us . they didn ' t have horned helmets , as this image suggests . and now it seems they filed their teeth , possibly as a status symbol viking warriors filed deep grooves in their teeth , and they probably had to smile broadly to show them off , according to new finds in four major viking age cemeteries in sweden . caroline arcini of sweden ' s national heritage board and colleagues analysed 557 skeletons of men , women and children from 800 to 1050 ad . she discovered that 22 of the men bore deep , horizontal grooves across the upper front teeth . " the marks are traces of deliberate dental modifications ... they are so well - made that most likely they were filed by a person of great skill ," arcini writes in the american journal of physical anthropology , a journal of the american association of physical anthropologists . traces of teeth mutilation have been found in all parts of the world except europe , with the practice reaching its peak from 700 to 1400 ad , during the height of the viking age . the vikings were the first europeans to have displayed this custom , perhaps because they picked it up during their travels . " this discovery is important as it shows that signs of cultural contact may happen between people over vast distances ," arcini says . however , the reason for and the importance of the furrows remain mysteries . " the only things that the people have in common are that they were men and that majority had died when they were quite young . the filed furrows were made in more or less the same area of the teeth in all individuals ," arcini says . the marks were cut deep into the enamel and occurred often in pairs or triplets . " to show their furrows , the individuals would have had to smile quite broadly ," arcini says . the researcher speculates that the marks could have been some sort of decoration or a badge to indicate class or military rank . " maybe they were warriors , although no skeletal injuries have been detected ," arcini says . a status symbol ? pia bennike , at the university of copenhagen ' s biological anthropology laboratory , agrees : " they did it on purpose , to mark that they belonged to a special group . or maybe they were slaves . this is a very unique and interesting find ." one hypothesis is that they could show an individual ' s ability to resist pain . they could have also represented some kind of achievement . " maybe this is the explanation for multiple furrows or deeper ones ," arcini says . the tools that the vikings used for handicrafts were made both of iron and stone . an experiment on a medieval tooth showed that with a lot of force and a file of steel , it takes about 20 minutes to cut a mark like the those of the vikings in the enamel . " how long it took on a living person is really difficult to know . even if the filing did not hurt , it most certainly must have been unpleasant ," arcini says . too above has once will she had her
