an inner ear as you have never seen it before university of sydney ' s key centre for microscopy and microanalysis , will report its findings in the journal acta oto - laryngologica . the scientists revealed the detailed structure of the inner ear , from a guinea pig , using a new method called x - ray microtomography . " it ' s ct [ computed tomography ] scanning for microscopy , basically a ct scanner for a microscope ," says jones . like hospital ct scanning , the method images internal structures in 3d using x - rays . structures , like bones , absorb more x - rays and are more visible than those that absorb less . the 3d image is built up by taking a series of ' slices ' of the solid object . but x - ray microtomography can take many more slices that a hospital ct scanner . this provides much higher resolution , allowing scientists to image the delicately thin structures of the inner ear . the image the scientists generated shows the stapes ( red ) the saccular macula ( yellow ) and the utricular macula ( blue ). it also shows the coils of the cochlea and the fluid - filled semicircular canals that help an animal keep balance . " this structure is actually embedded in the most dense bone in the body , the temporal bone , and normal hospital medical ct doesn ' t have enough resolution to see these ," says jones . secrets of an ancient eyeball one of the first studies jones was involved in that used the new technique was the imaging of 410 million - year - old fossilised fish eyeballs . the project , carried out with palaeontologist dr carole burrow from the university of queensland , was the first use of x - ray microtomography to investigate small vertebrate fossils . up only if same same few once being but was
