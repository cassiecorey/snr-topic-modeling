the new test is based on a stain that detects the protein keratin . vaginal cells , seen here , don ' t express the protein , giving a characteristic yellow colour . but skin cells and some mouth cells do , so they stain magenta and red a new forensic technique that tells scientists which cells come from which parts of the body could help solve sex crimes , its developers say . a new zealand phd student has found a simple way of identifying whether cell samples collected for dna testing come from the skin , mouth or vagina . " all it really involves is a couple of stains and some microscope slides of the cell samples and you get some lovely different coloured cells ," says claire french , from the university of auckland . currently , dna from cells found at a crime scene can link a person to the crime but cannot provide evidence about which part of the body the cells came from . the technique french has developed involves staining epithelial cells , the outer layer of body surfaces and organs , which are easily shed or secreted . the stain reveals different colours , corresponding to the presence of the protein keratin . skin cells express keratin and stain magenta ; vaginal cells don ' t express keratin and stain orange ; and cells in the mouth vary depending on their location , and stain red . sue vintiner , a forensic scientist with new zealand ' s environmental science and research ( esr ), says the technology could have practical applications . " i ' ve been involved in cases where we ' ve been unable to scientifically prove that an object ... has been used to violate someone in a sexual assault or whether it was just touched by the alleged victim ," she says . " claire ' s work could change that ." its developers say the technology could be used to develop a portable , histological staining kit for routine use at crime scenes and in forensic laboratories . the research , which will soon be presented at the european academy of forensic sciences conference , has received strong support from the new zealand police . claire ' s findings have also earned her new zealand ' s mcdiarmid young scientist of the year award . the intellectual property underpinning the research has been jointly protected by esr and the university of auckland . her his out i each
