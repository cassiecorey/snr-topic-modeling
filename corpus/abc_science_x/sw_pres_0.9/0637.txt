sequencing the honey bee genome could improve the search for genes linked to social behaviour scientists have unravelled the genetic code of the honey bee , uncovering clues about its complex social behaviour , heightened sense of smell and african origins . the results , published in the journal nature , makes the bee the third insect to have its genome mapped and joins the fruit fly and mosquito in the exclusive club . the honey bee , or apis mellifera , evolved more slowly than the other insects but has more genes related to smell . " in biology and biomedicine , honey bees are used to study many diverse areas , including allergic disease , development , gerontology , neuroscience , social behaviour and venom toxicology ," says professor gene robinson , director of the university of illinois and one of the leaders of the project . " the honey bee genome project is ushering in a bright era of bee research for the benefit of agriculture , biological research and human health ," he adds . with its highly evolved social structure of tens of thousands of worker bees commanded by the queen , the honey bee genome could also improve the search for genes linked to social behaviour . but the consortium of scientists , which includes australians , says a comprehensive analysis of the honey bee and other species will be needed to understand its social life . the queen lives 10 times as long as workers and lays up to 2000 eggs a day . despite having tiny brains , honey bees display honed cognitive abilities and learn to associate a flower ' s colour , shape and scent with food , which increases its foraging ability . the scientists who analysed the genetic code have discovered the honey bee originated in africa and spread to europe in two ancient migrations . " the african bees ' spread throughout the new world is a spectacular example of biological invasion ," the scientists write . the number of genes in honey bees related to smell outnumber those linked to taste . the insects also have fewer genes than the fruit fly or mosquito for immunity . honey bees use pheromones , substances secreted by glands , to distinguish the gender , caste and age of other bees , according to the scientists . " this dna sequence is a major step towards answering a basic question of social evolution . at the genomic level , what does it take to engineer an advanced colonial insect ?" says professor edward wilson , of harvard university in a commentary on the research . had above who above these below was of while t further once doing and their because too of on where what too once that he him their
