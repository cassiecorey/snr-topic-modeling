adult ( top ) and juvenile ( bottom ) umoonasaurus , one of two new species of ancient marine reptile scientists have identified two new species of ancient marine reptile that swam in an australian outback sea 115 million years ago . the reptiles , named umoonasaurus and opallionectes , belonged to the plesiosaurs group which included a predator like a killer whale from the jurassic period , says palaeontologist dr benjamin kear from the university of adelaide . kear , whose team studied 30 opalised fossils mainly from around the outback mining town of coober pedy in south australia , publish their research in the latest issue of the journal palaeontology and online in the journal biology letters . kear says the long - necked marine reptiles swam in the shallow water of an inland sea that once existed in central australia . freezing polar water covered large parts of australia 115 million years ago when the island continent was much closer to antarctica . the umoonasaurus was about 2 . 4 metres long and had three crest - like ridges on its skull . " imagine a compact body with four flippers , a reasonably long neck , small head and short tail , much like a reptilian seal ," kear says . the team named the reptile after the aboriginal name for coober pedy , umoona . the opallionectes was 6 metres long , with masses of needle teeth used to trap small fish and squid . its name means ' the opal swimmer from andamooka ', the scientists say . kear says most of the fossils found were of juvenile creatures , leading the scientists to believe they had discovered a seasonal breeding ground for the ancient reptiles . its same with through you
