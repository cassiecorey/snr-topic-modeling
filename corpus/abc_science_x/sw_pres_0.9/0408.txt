the researchers could not directly link smoking marijuana with lung cancer . but they found evidence of precancerous changes in the lung like oxidative stress , damaged tumour - fighting cells , and dna and tissue changes smoking marijuana can cause changes in lung tissue that may promote cancer , according to a review of decades of research on marijuana smoking and lung cancer . still , it is not possible to directly link pot use to lung cancer based on existing evidence . dr reena mehra of case western reserve university in cleveland , ohio and her colleagues publish their review in the current issue of the archives of internal medicine . " given the widespread use of marijuana , its use for what are believed to be medicinal purposes , and the increasing abuse and dependence on this substance , it is important to examine potential adverse clinical consequences ," the researchers write . to investigate whether marijuana smoking might lead to precancerous changes in the lungs or lung cancer , mehra and her team reviewed 19 studies . analyses of sputum and lung tissue performed in some of these studies found more cancer - promoting changes in pot smokers than in cigarette smokers or non - smokers . these changes included oxidative stress , dysfunction of tumour - fighting cells , changes in tissue structure and dna alterations , the researchers report . but none of the studies they analysed found evidence that marijuana smoking actually caused lung cancer , after factoring in the effects of tobacco use . " we must conclude that no convincing evidence exists for an association between marijuana smoking and lung cancer based on existing data ," mehra and her team write . increased risk nevertheless , the researchers add , the precancerous changes seen in studies included in their analysis and other factors do suggest that smoking pot could indeed boost lung cancer risk . other factors that could make pot smokers prone to lung cancer , the researchers say , include the fact that they generally inhale more deeply and hold smoke in their lungs longer than cigarette smokers , and that marijuana is smoked without a filter . it is known , they add , that marijuana smoking deposits more tar in the lungs than cigarette smoking does . the failure to find a marijuana - lung cancer link may have been due to methodological flaws in existing research , rather than the absence of such a link , the researchers say . doctors should advise their patients that marijuana does indeed have potential adverse effects , they conclude , including causing precancerous changes in the lungs . for more information about drugs and their side - effects , see the druginfo clearing house website run by the
