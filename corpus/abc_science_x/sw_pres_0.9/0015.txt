remote peoples can describe and understand geometrical concepts related to circles , triangles and parallel lines , scientists show . so , is geometry hard - wired in the brain ? amazonian hunter - gatherers who lack written language and who have never seen a maths book do well on basic geometry tests , researchers say in a study that suggests geometry may be hard - wired into the brain . adults and children alike showed a clear grasp of concepts such as where the centre of a circle is and the logical extension of a straight line . this was despite not having words for these concepts , the researchers report today in the journal science . professor stanislas dehaene of the college de france in paris and colleagues tested 14 children and 30 adults of an amazonian group called the munduruku , and compared their findings to tests of us adults and children . " munduruku children and adults spontaneously made use of basic geometric concepts such as points , lines , parallelism , or right angles to detect intruders in simple pictures , and they used distance , angle , and sense relationships in geometrical maps to locate hidden objects ," they write . " our results provide evidence for geometrical intuitions in the absence of schooling , experience with graphic symbols or maps , or a rich language of geometrical terms ." geometry is an ancient field and dehaene ' s team postulated that it may spring from innate abilities . " many of its propositions -- that two points determine a line , or that three orthogonal axes localize a point -- are judged to be self - evident and yet have been questioned on the basis of logical argument , physical theory , or experiment ," the researchers write . there was no way the munduruku could have learned these ideas , they add . " most of the children and adults who took part in our experiments inhabit scattered , isolated villages and have little or no schooling , rulers , compasses , or maps ," they write . " furthermore , the munduruku language has few words dedicated to arithmetical , geometrical , or spatial concepts , although a variety of metaphors are spontaneously used ." playing by the rules they designed arrays of six images , each of which contained five conforming to a geometric concept and one that violated it . " the participants were asked , in their language , to point to the weird or ugly one ," the researchers write . " all participants , even those aged 6 , performed well above the chance level of 16 . 6 %." the average score was nearly 67 % correct , identical to the score for us children . " the spontaneous understanding of geometrical concepts and maps by this remote human community provides evidence that core geometrical knowledge , like basic arithmetic , is a universal constituent of the human mind ," they conclude . if has while under from until s but your after of which how below over above hers before below some their then same on being himself of have then to after what
