textiles made from feathers may be lightweight , good insulators and cushion impact chicken feathers and rice straw are being turned into fabric fibres that resemble wool , linen and cotton , scientists say . the textiles may help reduce not only agricultural waste but also our reliance on petroleum - based synthetic fabrics . "[ some ] 50 % of all fibres are from petroleum , and we have an oil issue ," says yiqi yang , a professor of textile science at the university of nebraska - lincoln , who is collaborating with doctoral candidate narendra reddy . yang and his colleagues think that agricultural waste could offer an alternative source . rice straw is made up of the bits and stems left over after a rice harvest and , like cotton and flax , is composed mostly of cellulose . it now accounts for about 526 million tonnes of waste worldwide . chicken feathers , which are composed of keratin , like wool , make up about 1 . 8 billion kilograms in waste each year in the us . much of this material ends up in landfill . according to yang , even processing a small fraction of this agricultural waste and turning it into textiles could have a significant impact on world demand , which totals about 63 million tonnes of fibres a year . yang ' s team has already conducted research on developing fibres from rice straw . " he ' s a leader in this kind of research ," says jonathan chen , associate professor at louisiana state university in baton rouge . first , collect your rice straw just like cotton , the rice straw is harvested , baled , shipped to a plant and broken down into tiny pieces . the straw is treated with a combination of chemicals , heat and enzymes , and washed repeatedly . the process breaks down the straw , separating the cellulose fibres from other natural materials . these materials include hemicellulose , a carbohydrate , silica , a hard mineral substance , and lignin , a polymer that hardens and strengthens plant cell walls . the process of extracting the fibres is under patent review and so yang is reluctant to describe it in too much detail . but he says that it is not complicated or expensive . " the number one challenge is the cost - effectiveness for utilising these kinds of waste materials ," says chen . " if you can compete with current available products , you will have a chance ." fluffy feathers research for processing fibres from the chicken feathers is not as advanced as the rice straw research . so far , yang and his team have characterised the fibre properties of feathers to determine the best applications . they have focused on the thin , filamentous parts that form the fluffier parts of the feather . these parts have microscopic air pockets interlaced within a honeycomb architecture . those properties could offer fibres that are lightweight , good insulators and cushion impact . the biggest hurdle may be getting the textile industry to accept chicken and rice fibres . yang expects the driving force to come from the clothing industry , where people are always looking out for durable , inexpensive , natural textiles . myself her once t when their him hers myself only then doing was myself by your himself being yourself few out again other doing this any whom most when
