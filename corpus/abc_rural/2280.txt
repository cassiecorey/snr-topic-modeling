WA fishers welcome new illegal fishing laws
The fishing industry in Western Australia has welcomed new laws to toughen the nation's defences against illegal fishing.
The Royal Australian Navy has been given permission to shoot at uncooperative illegal fishing vessels to disable engines or rudders but not sink them.
Kimberley Professional Fishing Association spokesman Alan Fraser believes it will be a better deterrent.
"There's been a lot of talk of action being taken and money and resources being expended on trying to solve this problem, but really up until now our efforts have been pretty dismal," he said.
