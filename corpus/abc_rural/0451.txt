Fears new marine park boundaries will force out fishermen
The fishing industry says new boundaries for proposed marine parks off the coasts of Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia will not restrict commercial fishing as much as first thought.
After complaints about the draft boundaries, Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell has now finalised the plans for the marine protected areas, which will cover 200,000 square kilometres of ocean.
Although the Government will provide $220 million compensation, Ross McGowan from Seafood Industry Victoria is worried about fishermen who will be forced out of the industry.
"For us to sit here and say 'it's minimised' is all well and good. But the end of the day these marine protected areas will have a significant impact on some individuals, so significant that they will have to get out of the industry," he said.
