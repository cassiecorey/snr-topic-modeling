Farmer hopes for prosthesis for three-legged cow
You may have seen a three-legged dog or even a three-legged cat, but what about a three-legged cow?
Tasmanian dairy farmer Geoff Heazlewood was devastated when he recently found one of his best cows had broken her leg after falling in a river.
It turned out amputation was the only option and he says while the is cow recovering well, she could do with some extra help getting around.
"I would dearly love to hear from somebody that was used to making prostheses and we could perhaps put a prosthesis on her," he said.
