Ord River Irrigation Scheme expansion approved
The long-awaited second stage development of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme in Western Australia's far north has been given the green light.
Tenders have been called by the WA Government, which has settled environmental and native title issues surrounding the development.
The expansion of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme will make 16,000 hectares of irrigated farmland available.
The Government says it is seeking expressions of interest for development of between 7,000 and 16,000 hectares of land.
Resources Minister John Bowler says land could be available for planting as soon as 2008.
"We believe we can quadruple the amount of hectares placed under agriculture in irrigation," he said.
"This will make the Ord Valley one of the most significant agricultural areas in Australia."
