Bracks names new Agriculture Minister
A former motor mechanic is set to become Victoria's new Agriculture Minister.
Premier Steve Bracks has announced a major shake-up of his Cabinet after his third term election win.
Member for Ripon Joe Helper will be sworn-in to replace Bob Cameron, who moves to the police portfolio.
Mr Helper admits he has been given the role at a challenging time, as many farmers struggle with the drought.
"I've certainly got a lot to learn, there's no question about that," he said.
"I look forward to getting out and listening to farm businesses, to farmers, to communities and farming organisations.
