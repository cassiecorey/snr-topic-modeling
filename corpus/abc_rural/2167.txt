Pig tracing may go high-tech
The pig industry is considering launching an electronic system to trace animals.
The industry has already set up a traceability system called Pig Pass, where producers who export pigs fill out national vendor declaration forms.
But Bill Salter from producer group Australian Pork Limited (APL) says they are now looking at a paperless system with swipe cards instead of individual animal tags.
"The system would work on the basis of having everyone involved in Pig Pass actually being registered on the APL database," Mr Salter said.
