NFF encourages support for farmers
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says critics of the Federal Government's extension to its drought support are ignoring economic reality.
Environmental scientists from the Wentworth Group and the Australia Institute say the $350-million extension to the relief program is encouraging farmers to stay on unviable land.
But NFF president David Crombie says farmers must be supported, so when the drought breaks they are ready to quickly ramp up production.
"I mean Australian agriculture contributes something like $103 billion into the Australian economy, $30 billion in exports, 1.6 million jobs, we're achieving productivity growths of 3-4 per cent. Australian agriculture is very important to Australia," he said.
