Giant pumpkins attract tourists
Giant pumpkins were a major attraction at the weekend's Kununurra Agricultural Show in Western Australia's far north.
Just under 5,000 people came to see the Ord Valley's produce, including tourists travelling across Australia's north.
Two pumpkins tied for the title as the show's biggest, weighing in at 55.9 kilograms.
The oversized vegetables caught most by surprise, including Gumi from Osaka, Japan.
