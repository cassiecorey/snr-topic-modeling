Winemakers pay tribute to Len Evans
One of the great names of the Australian wine industry has died at the age of 75.
Wine judge and writer Len Evans is credited with bringing Australian wines to prominence on the world stage, by encouraging a move away from fortified varieties into other blends.
In 1968, Mr Evans founded the Rothbury Estate in the Hunter Valley with Murray Tyrrell.
Mr Tyrrell's son, Bruce, says his father's friend was instrumental in building Australia's wine export industry.
"He was certainly a very important cog in what wheel, there's no question or doubt about that," he said.
"Len was a larger than life personality, and he was one of those people that no door was ever locked to, because if it was, he just opened it and walked through it.
