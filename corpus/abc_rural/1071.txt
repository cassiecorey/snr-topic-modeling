Councils say water initiative hurting rates revenue
New South Wales local councils say they are facing a dramatic drop in rates revenue as a result of the National Water Initiative.
Under the water reform process, land and water titles are being separated which is expected to cause a drop in rates for irrigated land.
Councils now have to come up with a new rating formula to make up the difference.
The Nationals' Member for Murrumbidgee, Adrian Piccoli, is calling on the State Government to give councils more time and more help to make the changes.
"The Victorian Government has postponed the implementation of these new council rating structures by two years," he said.
