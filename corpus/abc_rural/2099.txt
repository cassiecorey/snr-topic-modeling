Severe frosts prompt call for financial help
Tasmanian apple, pear and cherry growers are calling for financial assistance following record severe frosts in the past two months.
Fruit Growers Tasmania has started talks with the state and federal governments, asking them for interest rate subsidies and to waive the asset test for Centrelink support.
President Tim Reid says some growers have lost 90 per cent of their crops and many will not have a positive cash flow until the harvest in early 2008.
