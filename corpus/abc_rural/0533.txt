Live trade to Egypt may re-start soon
The Federal Government has confirmed it is working on a plan which could see the livestock export trade to Egypt reopen in a matter of weeks.
The trade to Egypt was banned in February when the 60 Minutes program aired footage showing animals being treated outside industry standards.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says his investigations proved the cattle were not Australian, but he shut the trade because the humane handling of Australian animals could not be guaranteed.
The Minister now says industry is forming a plan which will animals treated better.
"There may well be some Australian stockmen or vets or locally employed and trusted staff," he said.
But RSPCA National President Hugh Wirth says more than increased supervision is needed.
"You can do all the supervising you like, it's not going to change the fact that the abattoir workers have a great deal of difficulty dealing with Australian cattle."
Around 12,000 head of cattle were exported to Egypt last year worth around $10 million.
The cattle industry says the findings of a new report add weight to the argument to resume the live cattle trade with Egypt, with appropriate monitoring.
Cameron Hall from Livecorp says the report has found Australia has the highest animal welfare standards in the world.
"There needs to be appropriate systems and appropriate monitoring to ensure some of the reasons that the trade was halted and suspended in the first place, cannot continue and particularly we can guarantee levels of assurance that the animals that we market into those countries are processed and handled with a level of care that we would expect," he said.
The report was commissioned by Livecorp and Meat and Livestock Australia.
The first shipment of live cattle out of the far north Queensland city of Townsville in three years is due to leave at the weekend.
