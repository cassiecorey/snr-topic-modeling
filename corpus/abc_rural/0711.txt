Food origin labelling standards come into effect
From today it is compulsory for retailers to identify the country of origin of fresh food.
Fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts and seafood will have to be clearly labelled.
Mike Redmond from the Virginia Horticulture Centre in South Australia says the industry will now push for labelling of frozen, packaged and processed food.
"Look it's about giving the consumer the right to choose whether they're going to buy an Australian product and all the good things that go with that like all our food safety standards which are some of the most rigorous in the world, and they get to choose," Mr Redmond said.
