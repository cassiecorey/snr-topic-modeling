Graincorp says lower harvest estimate 2 million tonnes
Grain handler, Graincorp, is sticking by its forecast harvest of two million to four million tonnes across eastern Australia, despite the worsening drought.
The latest figures show 94 per cent of New South Wales is now affected by drought.
But Graincorp's central regional manager, Murray Wilkinson, says some areas are producing better yields than expected.
"North Queensland and Moree are going to exceed those forecasts that we had in to make-up the numbers, and it looks as though Dubbo will as well," he said.
"At this stage we're up to one point two million tonnes in the system and I suppose the lower end of the forecast is looking promising at this stage."
Only two per cent of New South Wales is now rated as having satisfactory conditions.
