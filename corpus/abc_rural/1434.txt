Clean Seas eyes onshore tuna breeding success
South Australian company Clean Seas believes it might be only a year away from becoming the first to crack the secret of breeding tuna onshore.
The problem lies in trying to replicate breeding conditions in the wild, where tuna travel vast distances to find warm water to spawn.
Marine biotechnologist Abigail Elizur says the company is drawing on knowledge from around the world to try to speed up the process.
"I hope that by the end of the year or the start or the beginning of 2007 we will already have spawning and we certainly will try and apply all the previous knowledge," she said.
