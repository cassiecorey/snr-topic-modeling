Farmers taking on environmental reforms: survey
A new survey shows more farmers are changing their management styles to address environmental problems.
A survey by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics of 1,700 broadacre and dairy farmers shows 80 were willing to accept lower profits in some years to help the environment.
Economist Andrew Hodges says the number of farmers involved in Landcare has also risen to 41 per cent since the last survey in 2001.
"Around 60 per cent of farmers reported that they had some kind of degradation issue on their farm," he said.
"Farmers, once they have identified that they've got a degradation issue, are responding really well to those problems.
