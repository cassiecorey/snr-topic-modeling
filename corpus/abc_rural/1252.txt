Irrigators fined for stealing water
Two irrigators in south-west New South Wales have been fined for stealing water.
The state's Department of Natural Resources claims a farmer at Euston was found to have extracted more water than he was entitled to, while an irrigator at Barham tampered with a meter on a water pump.
Department spokesman Peter Wells says the breaches were discovered during routine monitoring and prompted follow-up investigations.
"In a drought it's more important than ever that everyone sticks to the rules because the rivers are very stressed the other users are typically on low or nil irrigation requirements," he said.
