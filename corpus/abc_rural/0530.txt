Court rules against AWB over 'apology' document
A Federal Court judge has ruled against wheat exporter AWB, in its fight to keep a so-called apology document confidential.
The document was prepared on the advice of US-based public relations consultant, and was mistakenly included in evidence AWB tendered to the Cole inquiry.
Justice Neil Young took just 10 minutes to rule, AWB had no claim for legal professional privilege, and rejected the company's efforts to keep the document confidential.
Justice Young also found Commissioner Cole had every right to rule on the legal status of the document, a point disputed by AWB.
