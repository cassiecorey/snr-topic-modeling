Submissions sought on chemical spray drift
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is calling for submissions on its plan to reduce chemical spray drift on farms.
Producers, insurance companies and other farm industry representatives had their say on the proposals at a forum in Canberra yesterday.
The authority's David Loschke says the plan includes national regulations for labelling and handling pesticides.
"There's a range of approaches on existing labels, quite a bit of variability and that's something we want to change," he said.
"We want to bring them all into a much more uniform sort of approach and an approach that the states with their powers of enforcement can use effectively to control their uses."
Submissions are due on October 6.
