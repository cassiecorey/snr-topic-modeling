Animals continue to feel cyclone's impact
Native and feral animals are showing up on farms looking for food more than five months after cyclone Larry crossed the north Queensland coast.
The cyclone damaged 15,000 homes, disrupted farming and devastated bushland.
Atherton Tablelands dairy farmer James Geraghty says he has never seen such an explosion of wildlife.
"A mate's got cassowaries coming onto his lawn," he said.
"There's a six-metre python living in a bloke's house in Cairns because he's got nowhere to live in the scrub.
"Pigs and dogs we haven't seen the numbers of what you call feral animals outside the scrub for a long long time.
