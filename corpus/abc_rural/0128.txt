WA prepares for cyclone Glenda
Western Australia's Pilbara region is bracing for severe winds and heavy rainfall as cyclone Glenda tracks down the coast.
The cyclone has been upgraded to category five and is north of Port Hedland, with warnings of wind gusts up to 200 kilometres an hour.
Weather forecaster Gavin Edmonds says by late tomorrow or Friday morning cyclone Glenda will be very close to the Pilbara coast.
"It is a very large system, one of the strongest cyclones we have seen off our Australian coast line," Mr Edmonds said.
"The estimated wind gust in near the centre are up to 300 kilometres an hour, exactly the same as Larry was prior to it approaching the coast line.
