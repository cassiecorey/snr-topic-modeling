Santa gets helping hand from businessman
An anonymous Sydney businessman has donated $150,000 to buy Christmas hampers for drought affected families in western New South Wales.
The donor says he wanted to let struggling families know that people in the cities do care about them.
Jamie Simmons from Broken Hill's Christian City Church hopes it will make a little difference.
