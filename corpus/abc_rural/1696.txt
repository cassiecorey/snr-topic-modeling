Ute muster extra special for WA couple
Thousands of people are heading for Deniliquin in southern New South Wales for the national ute muster.
It will be an extra special trip for Western Australian vegetable grower Rob, who will kick off the weekend by marrying his fiance Iris.
Rob says it was a deep passion and love of utes that brought them together.
"We were going to get married before we come on the trip but then one of our friends decided well why don't you get married at the ute muster," he said.
"So we've organised it for the day before and we've been down the track a couple of times before and finally we've sort of met somebody that's got exactly the same interests, she's more into the truck than me at times, and well it's, fun."
