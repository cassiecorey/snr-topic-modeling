Website to help drought-stricken farmers
A website is being launched for drought-stricken farmers in Victoria to help each other through the summer.
Farmers will be able to use the Internet to advertise available feed or labour with the site expected to be up and running within two weeks.
Doug Chant from the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria says the site will put farmers in touch with a wide network of people and resources.
"Basically it will be feed that will be available, farmers that have feed whether it be hay, silage, grain, will have the opportunity of putting it on the web," he said.
"Anything to do with helping farmers through these very difficult times, it gives other farmers in other parts of the state the opportunity of being able to help out."
