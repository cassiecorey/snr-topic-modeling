New mulesing alternative may help make lambs fatter
Australian Wool Innovation says alternative mulesing methods are helping lambs to gain weight faster.
Mulesing involves removing a fold of skin around the breach area, and has been targetted by animal welfare groups as inhumane.
AWI has been trialling a clip and an injection system, which removes wool from the breach and tails of lambs.
Spokesman Scott Williams says lambs with the clips grew to 26 kilos, while the mulesed lambs grew to 24 kilos, but he is warning growers about getting too excited.
"The growers we're working with recognise that we're in the research and development phase," he said.
