Labor's ethanol pledge gets mixed response
There has been a mixed response in Queensland to Labor's election promise to make all petrol include 5 per cent ethanol.
Premier Peter Beattie says the mandate would increase to 10 per cent after 2010.
The Premier says the 5 per cent mandate will increase the use of ethanol 20-fold, to over 200 million litres, in a year.
The Opposition says it was their policy five years ago.
Grain growers on the Darling Downs say it is good news, as they have plans to build an ethanol plant at Dalby which will consume 400,000 tonnes of sorghum and produce 160 million litres.
The petrol companies Caltex and BP are less supportive of a mandate and the RACQ says there is no evidence that ethanol blends are being sold at prices below normal petrol.
