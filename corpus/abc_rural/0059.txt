Japan's mad cow case worries cattle industry
The Cattle Council is worried about a consumer backlash against beef in Japan, after the latest outbreak of mad cow disease.
Japan has confirmed its first case of the disease in cattle specifically raised to provide meat.
All 22 previously confirmed cases of the disease were in dairy cattle.
Council President Bill Bray says Japan is our biggest customer for beef exports, and the Japanese consumer is very conscious of food safety.
"It is a concern, it's a wagyu cow that's some 14 years old and it is the 23rd case that's been identified in Japan," he said.
