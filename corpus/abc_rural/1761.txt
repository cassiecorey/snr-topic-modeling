Landcare conference to focus on climate change
Climate change is high on the agenda at this week's International Landcare Conference, which has opened in Melbourne.
More than 1,000 farmers in Landcare, academics and representatives from natural resource groups from Australia and across the globe have converged on Melbourne, for the week-long conference.
The theme for the conference is "building communication networks to create future landscapes, lifestyles and livelihoods".
Top of the agenda is climate change and the balance between agriculture and the environment.
Kicking off proceedings today is Land and Water Australia's chairman, Bobbie Brazil, looking at if Landcare is an ancient myth or modern dreaming.
Landcare leaders will be recognised for their work at tomorrow night's National Landcare awards, presented by the Governor-General Major General Michael Jeffery.
A Canadian environmental lobbyist has told the Landcare conference that Australia would not be in a drought at all, if people used water more wisely.
Maude Barlow, who is writing a book called the Global fight for the right to water, says Australians need to change their attitudes towards water saving.
"I think the current drought situation is a reflection of over use and abuse of water," she said.
