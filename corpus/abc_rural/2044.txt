Fruit growers halve watering times
Victoria's fruit growers are cutting their watering times by half to ensure water supplies will last the season.
Extreme water shortages, particularly in the Goulburn Valley, mean orchardists have had to find ways to stretch their irrigation water.
Senior horticultural adviser Henry Schneider says new watering techniques for stonefruit are proving successful.
"Peaches respond very well to regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) it's a matter of just irrigating those peaches as you would on the normal intervals, say once a week but cut the irrigation time in half," he said.
