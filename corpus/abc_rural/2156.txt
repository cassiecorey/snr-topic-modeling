MLA holds Adelaide AGM
The livestock industry's peak national body, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), is holding its annual general meeting in Adelaide today.
Around 250 producers and industry representatives have finished the producers forum which covered the current and future direction of the red meat industry.
Many apologies were received from farmers, both local and interstate, who have been affected by bushfires and could not attend.
Four resolutions will be voted on at the AGM regarding the election of MLA directors, followed by a question period where the recent NLIS poll scandal and the process of registering voters from levy paying producers is expected to be raised.
At the same time, more than 150 cattle producers have rallied on the Western Downs in Queensland, in a direct boycott of the MLA meeting.
The Australian Beef Association (ABA) says it is protesting against laws and regulations that destroy the viability of producers.
The rally has seen producers travel from as far as Western Australia to attend the Queensland rally and chairwoman Linda Hewitt says she is going to call on the Australian Government to undertake a full review of Meat and Livestock Australia.
The rally has already seen a group of graziers hear from experts on depression and a psychiatrist who is highlighting the need for help at the farm gate.
Speaker Danny Beer from the US cattle producing organisation R-Calf has spoken about its support for country of origin labelling in the United States.
