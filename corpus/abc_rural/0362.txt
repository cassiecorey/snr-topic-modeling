Resource boom behind zinc mine's reopening
The booming base metals price has led to the reopening of an old zinc mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
Canadian company Teck Cominco will reopen its underground mine near Fitzroy Crossing because of a recent hike in zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange.
Teck Cominco exploration general manager Wayne Spilsbury says zinc is performing well after a three-year price glut.
"We were watching the stocks of zinc in the LME warehouses and making sure those numbers were coming down before we made a decision to reopen. There is now an under supply, but that has only turned up in the last year or so."
In South Australia, junior zinc explorer Terramin Australia has also benefited.
