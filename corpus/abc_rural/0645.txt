Tas apple industry facing challenges
The future of apple growing in the Apple Isle is being re-examined, in the light of increased global competition, a high dollar and increasing production costs.
Fruit Growers Tasmania has held a growers meeting to discuss the challenges.
One of the more well-known orcharding families, the Drieesen brothers at Castle Forbes Bay, is opting out of the industry after 50 years.
Jos Driessen says the land, overlooking the scenic D'Entrecasteaux Channel, will be sold to sea changers.
"My plans for the future are to retire. I've been losing the passion to grow apples. I think it's becoming a more difficult industry to be in," he said.
