Debate intensifies about fuel alternatives as oil prices rise
Oil prices are not getting any better with the price of West Texas crude jumping again last night to $US72 a barrel.
As prices go up, debate is intensifying about fuel alternatives.
Bruce Robinson from the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas says Australia could halve its transport fuel usage by minimising its dependence on cars.
He says fuel taxes should be increased similar to the system introduced by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in United Kingdom in the 1980s.
"If we continue to provide very cheap petrol and to give excise free petrol to everyone and subsidise it as happens in Queensland then we are just going to continue down the oil dependence [road]," he said.
"The enormous legacy Margaret Thatcher has left to Britain, she's given the price signals that oil is going to be more expensive then they are not nearly so dependent on cheap fuel as we are."
The higher price of crude oil is causing investors to take a closer look at the biofuels industry.
A new ethanol plant opens in the US every 10 days and around the world millions of dollars are being poured into biofuel projects to reduce dependence on oil.
Agribusiness investment adviser Shane Kelly says Australian investors are also keen to back a local ethanol industry.
"It's fair to say that as oil prices increase, the interest in ethanol plants has increased markedly," he said.
