Vaile to concentrate on winning back Nationals' seats
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile is defending the state of the Nationals after announcing a reshuffle to allow him to spend more time at home.
Mr Vaile will swap his Trade portfolio for Transport, with former agriculture minister Warren Truss to now represent Australia in international trade talks, including attempts to restart the Doha trade talks.
Mr Vaile says his job now is to concentrate on winning back seats and delivering improved infrastructure to rural Australia.
"What I'm doing is putting myself back on the ground in Australia on a permanent basis to ensure we have our best opportunity at the next election to increase our numbers," he said.
