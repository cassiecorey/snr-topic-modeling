Chile pushes for Australian wine industry cooperation
Australian researchers will soon be sharing information with one of our wine industry's major international competitors.
Charles Sturt University in New South Wales has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Institute of Agricultural Research in Chile.
Speaking through an interpreter, the Chilean Agriculture Minister Alvaro Rojas said the two countries could work together to develop Northern Hemisphere markets.
"The countries, especially in the Southern Hemisphere like New Zealand, Australia and Chile, need to be working together," he said.
