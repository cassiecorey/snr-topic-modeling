Use of brown coal could reduce greenhouse emissions, study shows
A research project into the use of brown or dirty coal could reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions from power generation to close to zero in the next decade.
The Monash Energy and Anglo Coal project in Victoria is exploring the feasibility of drying, gasifying and then liquefying coal into a new synthetic low emission fuel.
With 80 per cent of Australia's power generation coming from coal, Jeff Cochrane from Monash Energy says there will be important benefits for the environment
