Wheat, barley forecasts drop due to dry conditions
The big dry has led the Emerald Group to dramatically lower its wheat and barley forecasts.
The commodity management company is predicting a crop of 16 million tonnes of wheat, possibly rising to 19 million under ideal spring conditions.
Barley production is expected at six million tonnes, and a canola crop of one million tonnes.
Executive director Mike Chaseling says lower wheat and barley forecasts have had a big impact on prices.
"It's been a spectacular rally here, basis levels have driven up relative to US futures dramatically in the last month or so," he said.
"Barley prices are up $60 for the month, there's been a spectacular rally here.
"Barley is trading in and around $230 a tonne, port less rail, right through most port zones in Eastern Australia and a bit higher in northern port zones.
