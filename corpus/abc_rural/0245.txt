Dairy Farmers restructure goes ahead despite profit
Despite posting a half-year profit of $4.7 million, the Dairy Farmers Co-operative will push on with a restructure involving the closure of four plants.
The Bomaderry factory, in the south-east of New South Wales, shuts down today, while the Toowoomba plant, in southern Queensland, will close by the end of this month with the loss of 12 full and part-time jobs.
Chief executive Rob Gordon says changes across the business are expected to save $42 million a year.
