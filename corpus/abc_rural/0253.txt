WA wine producer secures large UK contract
Palandri wines of Margaret River in Western Australia has just secured the state's single largest export ever into the United Kingdom.
Eighty thousand cases will go to 1,800 British supermarkets.
Palandri's Gordon Grant says WA is being recognised as producing a unique, quality wine for under $24.
He says the contract is significant for bulk producers of generic wines.
"It's really starting to gain ground, the buyers in particular are staring to see Western Australia as something very different to the other material they have got on their shelves," he said.
