AWB executive announces retirement
AWB senior executive Jill Gillingham has announced her retirement, two days after giving evidence at the oil-for-food Inquiry.
The inquiry heard that Ms Gillingham acted as the go-between for former AWB boss Andrew Lindberg and American public relations expert Peter Sandman in the drafting of the so-called apology document.
She was also involved in negotiating $750 million a year worth of grain handling and storage contracts, and in co-ordinating AWB's response to the UN's Volcker inquiry.
