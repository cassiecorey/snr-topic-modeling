PETA takes aim at Middle East
Animal rights group PETA says it will target Middle Eastern countries for the first time, as part of its campaign to stop live exports from Australia.
The group says it will reveal alleged abuses in slaughterhouses in several Gulf countries at a press conference next week in Dubai.
