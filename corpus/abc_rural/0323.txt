Credibility damaged
In another development, a survey shows the credibility of the Federal Government and wheat exporter AWB has been damaged by the oil-for-food scandal.
Roy Morgan Research has surveyed more than 650 people living in rural and metropolitan areas about their perceptions of AWB and the Government since the Cole inquiry began.
Director Gary Morgan says the public is not accepting the message being pushed by the Government about its knowledge of the deals and most have questions about AWB.
"Sixty-five per cent said they did not act ethically, only 12 per cent said they did," Mr Morgan said.
"We asked the question: 'Do you think the Prime Minister John Howard acted ethically on this issue or not'.
"Fifty-four per cent said no, he did not act ethically, 29 per cent said he did, 17 per cent were undecided.
"We asked the same question about Alexander Downer. Fifty-six per cent said 'he did not act ethically'.
