Frost-tolerant crops a possibility: scientists
Scientists believe grain growers could one day be able to sow frost-tolerant cereal crops.
The Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics in Adelaide is studying the genes of Japanese barley, which has frost-tolerant properties.
Frost damage is believed to cost South Australia's and Victoria's barley industries more than $30 million per year.
Professor Geoff Fincher says this research could eventually have applications for other crops.
