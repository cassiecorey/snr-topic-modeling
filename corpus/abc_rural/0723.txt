Eastern states begin to offload stock
We heard yesterday about WA graziers offloading stock with the dry conditions, 
and the trend is also starting to appear in western New South Wales and the Victorian Mallee.
About 8,000 ewes and wethers were offered at a special sheep sale at Swan Hill yesterday.
Livestock agent Cameron Mckay says many farmers in the region are supplementary feeding their stock and desperately need rain.
"Western New South Wales probably had a better start than the Mallee but now with continuing dry conditions the feed that has germinated is drying up and the frosty conditions it's also not helping growing conditions at all," he said.
There was a very slight recovery in wool prices this week, with the benchmark eastern market indicator up one cent to 728 cents a kilogram clean.
