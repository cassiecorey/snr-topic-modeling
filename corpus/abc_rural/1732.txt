North-west WA worried about biosecurity risks
In far north Western Australia, farmers who want to develop new luxury bed and breakfast accommodation in the Ord River irrigation area will now have to take biosecurity risks into account.
The Shire of Wyndham East Kimberley is amending its Town Planning Act to protect the region's agriculture, which is highly regarded because of its isolation.
It is worried about the threat of pests and diseases that could be brought in by tourists.
Vaughan Davies from Tourism Western Australia says it is the first time biosecurity has played such a major role.
