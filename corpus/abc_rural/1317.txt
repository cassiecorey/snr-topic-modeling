Future growth in agriculture depends on exports: ABARE
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says most of the future growth in Australian agriculture will depend on exports.
The peak commodity forecaster has released a report showing agriculture's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen from around 3.6 per cent in the early 1980s to 2.7 per cent in the years leading up to 2005.
That is mainly due to the growth in the services, mining and manufacturing sectors.
ABARE spokeswoman Lisa Elliston says while agriculture continues to expand, it needs to focus on international markets because the domestic market is so small.
"In particular that means that we have to focus on things like barriers to trade, so that we have tariffs and import quotas that continue to be an important issue," she said.
