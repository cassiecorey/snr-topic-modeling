Wimmera farmers say AWB should have released apology letter sooner
Wheat growers say AWB could have taken the heat of the accusations it had paid kickbacks to the former Iraqi Government, by publishing a letter of apology before the Oil for Food Inquiry.
The Inquiry yesterday released a document prepared by former AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg in December, which said the company was truly sorry it did not challenge the payments, despite warning signs, and it should have done better.
Farmers in Victoria's Wimmera region say by trying to block the letter's release through the Federal Court, AWB has only raised further questions about what it was trying to hide.
"I would have believed that if it had have been presenter prior to the Cole Inquiry it may have defused quite a lot of the heat and argument within the Cole Inquiry itself," one farmer said.
"In hindsight AWB should have published a very similar letter, if not the same letter early on in the piece and the witch-hunt might not have gone on to the extent that it has," another farmer said.
A rural public relations consultant agrees that the apology document should have been released earlier.
Mark Paterson from Currie Communications says it would have made a big difference to AWB's reputation.
"Looking at the draft statement of contrition, it's an excellent letter of apology," he said.
"Yes it admits guilt, but what it shows is that AWB is human, and at no point at any time during this whole process have they demonstrated any humility at all."
Meanwhile, eight wheat exporters, including Cargill, Glencorp and AWB have bid for the latest tender to supply 3 million tonnes of wheat to India.
AWB has confirmed it will make an offer to supply 1.2 million tonnes of the contract, while the other companies are believed to have offered for smaller amounts.
