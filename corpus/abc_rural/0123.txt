Milk prices increase angers WA farmers
Western Australian dairy farmers are angry at milk price increases announced by dairy company Fonterra, because they say they are not enough.
Fonterra owns the state's biggest milk processor, Peter and Brownes (PB).
Farmers say the increase of 1.6 cents per litre, as well as an extra two cents a litre for production is too little, too late.
Northcliffe farmer Alan Walker says farmers should demand a fairer price.
"I would like PB suppliers to all to send a letter there, just to say how they've been treated," he said.
"The way to look at it is if only five people send a letter over there, then we may as well get back to work because nobody's worried.
"But if 105 people send a letter over there, I think the Fonterra board would have to look at that quite seriously and come back and renegotiate this situation."
