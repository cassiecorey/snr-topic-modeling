Bankers 'not forcing farmers' off land
The Australian Bankers Association has defended the banks' record in dealing fairly with drought-stricken farmers, following an appeal from Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile.
Mr Vaile has written to the major banks urging them not to foreclose on farm loans.
The bankers association's rural policy director, Stephen Carroll, says foreclosures are at a historically low level, because farmers are not waiting to be told before deciding to quit the land.
"The banks are not in the business of forcing people to get out of their businesses or to sell assets,'' he said.
