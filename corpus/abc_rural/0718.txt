Tassie growers want higher forward grain prices
Tasmanian grain growers are unhappy with forward contracts for feed grain for the coming harvest.
Crosby Lyne from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says average wheat and barley feed grain prices at $190 to $195 a tonne are not on parity with mainland prices, even allowing for freight.
He says the island's forward grain prices should be higher, given lower world production and dry conditions putting pressure on yields.
"We believe Tasmanian grain growers aren't being offered enough for their grain for the coming harvest," he said.
