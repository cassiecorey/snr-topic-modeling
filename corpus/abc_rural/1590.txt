Locust plague predicted for WA
Just when Western Australian farmers thought this season could not get any worse, authorities are worried about a locust plague.
Locust hatchings have been detected in 36 shires in the northern agricultural region.
The Department of Agriculture says rainfall last week will help them to thrive.
Entomologist Kevin Walden says a large locust outbreak would have a devastating effect on production in the west this year.
"If the outbreak is as big as what we've predicted, then it's going to be over a large proportion," he said.
"Even the hopper can eat approximately its own body weight per day in vegetation.
"And given when you get hopper bands that go across paddocks, basically they'll almost clean the paddock out of all vegetation that's there."
