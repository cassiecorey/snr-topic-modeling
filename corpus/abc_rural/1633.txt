DNA tests used in cattle-duffing case
Police in Queensland have used DNA evidence to crack one of the state's biggest cattle-duffing cases in years.
A mother and son from a north Queensland grazing family have been convicted in the Mackay District Court for stock theft.
The Queensland Stock Squad used DNA from the tails of 276 cattle allegedly stolen from four north Queensland properties to trace the animals back to their original owners.
Squad spokesman Terry Hanly says although the testing cost $15,000, it was worth it.
