NSW cherry growers to push for southern market
New South Wales cherry growers will renew a push today to get their fruit into southern Australian markets by raising the issue when the Prime Minister visits Goulburn.
The producers have been stopped from getting fruit into these markets because of concerns over fruit flies.
National Cherry Growers president, Ian Hay, says despite international markets accepting fruit fly management protocols, southern states will not accept them.
"If we can do protocols to get fruit safely overseas, surely we have got to be able to move it across the country as well," he said.
"If we don't make sure we have tidied up that homework here in Australia, those countries to protect their borders and decide they won't need a tariff, they will just turn around and say, 'hey you can't even get cherries out of NSW into Victoria.'
