Warm days cause grape vines to bud
The warmer than usual days and cold nights across Australia's south have caused grape vines to burst into life well ahead of normal spring budding.
Chardonnay vines have begun waking from their winter dormancy in South Australia's Coonawarra and Padthaway regions.
Viticulturist Dan Newson says that could result in an earlier vintage.
"The cold is playing a part," he said.
"What's happened is due to having dry soils and cooler temperatures overnight, the vines have gone into a deeper dormancy than what they normally will.
