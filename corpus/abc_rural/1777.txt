Frost decimates Limestone Coast vineyards
After frosts earlier hit the Barossa Valley, they have now decimated vineyards along the Limestone Coast of South Australia, wiping millions off the value of this year's vintage.
The region that's famous for its full blooded red wines could lose most of this year's grape crop after the temperature dropped below minus three for the second morning in a row.
Damage has been most severe in the Padthaway Valley.
Grower Ian Ward says he has lost about 90 per cent of his crop.
"I've got a couple of neighbours who are a hundred per cent affected, I have another neighbour who might be only something like 10 per cent [affected and got off pretty lightly," he said.
