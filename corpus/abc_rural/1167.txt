Wool growers seek speedy industry body merger
A rebel group of wool growers says a proposed merger between the industry's two peak bodies must be completed before producers are asked to vote to increase levies later this year.
Late last week, Australian Wool Innovation and Australian Wool Services signed a deal to look at the legal and financial implications of integration.
Martin Oppenheimer from the Australian Wool Growers Association has welcomed the move, and says it needs to happen quickly.
"The issue that we have now, moving forward, we've got Woolpoll 2006 coming up this December that will decide how much wool tax that wool growers will be spending for the next three years," he said.
"We need to know what the strategic plan is of the new merged entity.
"We can't be voting on a level of wool tax for the next three years if we don't know what the company will look like or what its goals will be."
In New South Wales, growers from the Goulburn-Yass branch of the Superfine Wool Growers Association voted unanimously to support the agreement at a meeting on Friday night.
Chairman John Ive says the merger talks have been dragging on for too long.
"With this sort of stand-off position between the two bodies, it wasn't giving good vibes to wool growers," he said.
