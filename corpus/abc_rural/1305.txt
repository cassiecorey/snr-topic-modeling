Labor claims underdog status in Qld election
Water and health are expected to dominate the Queensland state election, set for September 9.
It is 65 years since a Labor government won a fourth term in office in Queensland.
But despite holding 60 of the 89 seats in State Parliament the party is claiming underdog status, in part because its lost the last three by-elections and at least 10 sitting members, including a number of ministers, are not contesting this poll.
The Liberal Party has a new and untested leader who has been in the job for less than a week and the Coalition needs to win 22 seats to take office.
The key issues are the water crisis in the south-east and the stressed health system statewide.
The Premier says his plans for a south-east water grid and a $9 billion injection into health over the coming years will solve the problems.
