More incentives needed to biofuel take-up
A sustainable energy expert says there are not enough incentives for country people to start using biofuels.
While 75 per cent of the world's renewable energy projects are based in the country, Matthew Rosser from WA's Sustainable Energy Association says it is cheaper for farmers to buy diesel under the current tax system.
He says the demand for biofuels will come from city consumers, who do not get fuel exemptions.
"For the agriculture sector, the incentive to move towards biofuels isn't as strong as what it would be for consumers within the metropolitan areas," he said.
