US sugar quota changes mooted
The US sugar quota program has long been a source of frustration for Australian producers and exporters.
But changes may be in store.
With full implementation of the North American free tree agreement by 2008, US Agriculture Under-Secretary JB Penn says a flood of Mexican sugar could force changes.
"The border, being completely open in 2008, will mean that we will have to modify the program in some way Â we can't continue to operate a supply-control program if you can't control the supply," he said.
