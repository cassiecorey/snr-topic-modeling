Hotline to help men cope with depression
The impact of the drought has prompted Beyondblue to establish a national hotline specifically to help men deal with depression.
Chairman Jeff Kennett says men from country areas are more likely to suffer from depression, but are less likely to admit the problem.
He says the helpline will provide information, treatment and where to get help.
"Unfortunately depression is very prevalent throughout rural Australia and particularly among young men," he said.
"So what we hope with this Beyondblue information line is to give men the capacity wherever and however isolated their environment may be for the price of a local call to seek direction and help as to what to do in overcoming their depressive illness."
The hotline number, which will be in operation from July 1 is 1300 224 636.
WA-based rural financial counsellor Sue Smith says farmers are traditionally bad at managing stress and many cases are ignored.
She says one of the telltale signs is a change in behaviour.
"It's no wonder that people are feeling really stressed at the moment," she said.
"The first sign is in the body, somebody will start to feel tired, they'll get headaches, their body will start to ache.
"Sometimes it's other people that notice that they become quiet irritable, they may withdraw from their family and friends.
