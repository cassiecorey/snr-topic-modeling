Historic SA outback hotels set for sale
An increasing number of hotels are up for sale in outback South Australia.
Among them are the Oodnadatta Roadhouse and the iconic Mungerannie Hotel on the Birdsville Track.
Publican Genevieve Hammond says after 11 years they have decided to move from the desert and head north to the tropics of north Queensland.
She says although fewer people want to move to remote areas, they have already got some interested buyers.
