Wheat competition with India expected to heat up
Australia is set to have some stronger competition in India, with the Indian Government predicting a record domestic harvest.
The world's second-largest producer of grain is anticipating farmers will produce up to 80 million tonnes, compared to last year's 69 million.
India was forced to import wheat for the first time in six years on the back of last year's poor crop.
