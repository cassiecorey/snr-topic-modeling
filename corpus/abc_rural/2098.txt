Ram breeders on show
The Ram of the Year is a feature event of the annual Monaro merino ram sales in southern New South Wales this week.
Buyers from across the country are being selective in their purchases during the drought.
Winning ram breeder John Shiels, of Cottage Park, is going out on a high, retiring after 56 years of breeding and selling, and hopes the industry has a strong future.
