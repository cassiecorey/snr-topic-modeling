Old wives' tale confirmed, milk helps people sleep
If you have had a few sleepless nights over the continuing dry weather try a warm glass of milk before bed.
A Dutch study has found that the amino acids found in milk not only make for a better night's sleep, but also activate a hormone in the brain that makes people more active in the morning.
Dairy Australia dietitian Maree Garside says it is really confirming what many have known for a long time.
"They're suggesting that being alert in the morning may be due to a good night's sleep and this serotonin, that's produced in the brain is sort of helped along by having tryptophan in your food such as a glass of milk," she said.
"This is I guess a bit of research to back up something that we may have known for a while."
Meanwhile, Victorian scientists have found that the amount of feed a dairy cow eats does not affect its ability to withstand a longer lactation period.
Researchers believe extended lactation can makes cow healthier and give farmers better cash flow.
Dr Martin Auldist, from the Victorian Primary Industries Department, says the finding that no extra feed needs to be bought to sustain a longer lactation came as a big surprise.
