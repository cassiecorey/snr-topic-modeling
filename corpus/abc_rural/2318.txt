NFF hits out at make up of carbon emissions task force
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) is angry at the make-up of Prime Minister John Howard's new task force to investigate carbon emissions trading.
President David Crombie says stacking the group with mining and energy interests has hurt any real attempts to address climate change.
Senior staff from BHP Billiton, Qantas, Xstrata Alumina and the National Bank will join Federal Government bureaucrats on the task force.
Mr Crombie says it is extremely short-sighted of Mr Howard to exclude agriculture and other sector interests.
"Farmers do have it within their capacity to contribute to reducing emissions, which are one of the major causes of greenhouse gas change and are linked with climate change," Mr Crombie said.
"If farmers have a role to play there, which I believe they do, then it's important that they be part of any long term plan going forward."
Meanwhile a national emissions trading summit in Sydney has been told agriculture is paying the price for a century of pollution generated by the coal and resources sectors.
Australian Greens Senator Christine Milne says the Federal Government must set a national cap on emissions and coal companies should be forced to comply.
Senator Milne says the resources sector has made massive profits and agriculture has suffered as a consequence.
"We now have rural Australia suffering with extreme bushfires, with the collapse of their whole agricultural productive system because of climate change," she said.
"They are not being compensated for that by the coal industry so it's time that the resource-based industries recognised that they have got a role to play.
