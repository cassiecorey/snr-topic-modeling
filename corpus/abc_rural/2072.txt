NSW irrigators say crops at risk after water cuts
Irrigators in southern New South Wales are reeling after unprecedented cuts to water allocations.
Water for both the environment and agriculture has been pared back.
Inflows over the past five months have been the lowest on record and the NSW Government says town water must take priority.
High security and carry over water in the Murray has been cut by another 32 per cent.
While in the Murrumbidgee General security allocations have been cut by 5 per cent and high security users will see a 10 per cent reduction, Murrumbidgee Irrigation's Brett Tucker says agricultural production will be decimated.
