Volunteers pitch in to help out bushfire-affected farmers
A massive working bee is under way in southern New South Wales to help farmers burnt out on New Year's Day.
The bushfire blackened 25,000 hectares of farming country near Junee.
People from all walks of life have pitched in to repair the damage.
The fire destroyed 1,500 kilometres of fencing and six months on much of that still needs to be replaced.
There has been no substantial rain and for many farmers hand feeding livestock is the priority.
So armed with gloves, pliers and wire-strainers, more than 100 volunteers are lending a hand.
