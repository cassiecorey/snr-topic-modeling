Flugge admits transport fees knowledge
Former AWB chairman Trevor Flugge has told the Cole inquiry into the oil-for-food scandal he did know about transport fees being paid to a Jordanian trucking company.
When Mr Flugge stepped into the witness box he indicated he was having trouble hearing senior counsel assisting John Agius QC.
The problem soon cleared and the questioning became robust.
Mr Agius asked the witness: "Were you aware in September 2002 that AWB was paying a trucking fee?"
Mr Flugge replied: "Yes, I believe I was."
Mr Agius continued: "To whom did you believe AWB was contractually bound to paying the trucking fee," Mr Flugge answered, "to a Jordanian trucking company".
But when Mr Agius quizzed the former AWB chairman about UK-based Ronly Holdings, who funnelled the trucking fee to Alia on AWB's behalf, Mr Flugge told the inquiry he did not know at that time the payments were made through an indirect process.
Meanwhile AWB says growers should be reassured by its decision to wear millions of dollars in legal costs relating to the Cole inquiry and the Australian Tax Office.
The Grains Council of Australia previously called on AWB to confirm that growers would not have to pay the bills out of the national wheat pool.
AWB's Brendon Stewart says the wheat exporter's corporate division will now shoulder the costs.
"The key decisions that we announced yesterday are around protection the entitlements of the 05/06 pools, the 06/07 pools and importantly the operation of future pools," he said.
"In terms of under a trust structure, [it] should give growers all the assurance they need in terms of costs that are going to come out of those pools."
AWB has also dropped its wheat production forecast to between 12 to 15 million tonnes, based on the poor crop conditions.
Grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says a small winter crop will increase local competition and growers will probably abandon AWB's pools to take advantage of good domestic prices.
