Flegg accused of conflict of interest
The leader of the Queensland Liberal Party has been accused of a conflict of interest over his multi-million dollar share and investment portfolio.
Dr Bruce Flegg has 100,000 shares in Australia's biggest irrigation property, Cubbie Station, worth around $16 million.
He also holds shares in other companies, including forestry and rural media.
Ethicist Noel Preston believes the portfolio is a moral and political risk for Dr Flegg.
"Particularly now that he's leader of the Liberal Party and particularly because the water issue, whether Cubbie Station or elsewhere in Queensland is such a high-profile concern," he said.
"It is quuite apparent that he should have a close look at the question of moving his business interests right away from there.
"He's open very easily, I think, to the charge of having no credibility if he were to offer opinions in that respect."
Dr Flegg says his share portfolio is listed on the Internet.
He says he has never hidden any relevant matters.
"My pecuniary interest has been on the public register now for almost three years for anyone to see," he said.
"Clearly the one message that comes out of that is I'm not here because I need a job.
"I'm here because I want to fix the health system in Queensland.
"In government there is a likelihood I would have to divest most or all of those holdings."
