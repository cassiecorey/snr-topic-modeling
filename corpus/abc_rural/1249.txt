Grain dispute settled out of court
A legal dispute over grain warehoused by Creasy's Grain Enterprises has been settled out of court. When Creasy's collapsed last year, the receiver Ferrier Hodgson cited a 1933 High Court to claim title to a significant tonnage of grain stored under warehouse agreements. The Whillock family from the north-west, with financial and legal support from the Australian Farmers Fighting Fund, challenged that claim in the courts. A settlement of $97,000 has now been reached, returning the full market value of the grain to the Whillock family, plus a large portion of the legal costs. The NSW Farmers Association took up the fight for the Whillock family and the president, Jock Laurie, says although a legal precedent was not set it's still a significant win for the family. Meanwhile, Jackie Whillock has mixed feelings about the case. She's glad that they've received the full value of the grain, but disappointed the 1933 ruling hasn't been overturned.
