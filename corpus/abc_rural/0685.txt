Suspected illegal fishermen head to Broome for questioning
Six Indonesian fishermen suspected of poaching the sea cucumber trepang, have been taken to Broome for questioning by Australian Customs.
The Navy intercepted the fishermen at the weekend on a boat near Scotts Reef, 250 kilometres off the north-west coast of Western Australia.
Customs spokesman Peter Costantino claims they were caught with the sea cucumber on board.
"There was a small quantity of trepang found on board the vessel when the Navy boarded it and the fishermen were actively fishing at that time and diving on the reef," he said.
"The vessel started to be towed into Broome, but unfortunately broke up. The six fishermen were transported to the HMAS Larrakia and the vessel was destroyed at sea."
