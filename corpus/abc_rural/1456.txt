Goulburn Murray water diversion 'not fair'
Farmers are dismayed at the Victorian Government's plan to divert water away from the Goulburn Murray irrigation district to supply two regional cities.
The State Government is building a pipeline from the Waranga Basin to Bendigo, and now wants to extend it as far as Ballarat.
But Simon Ramsey says it is not fair on dairy farmers and fruit growers, who will only receive 7 per cent of the water allocations this season.
"It's disappointing given the angst and apprehension in the rural community about the present prolonged dry conditions and also obviously the very little allocations particularly in the Goulbourn system and Campaspe," he said.
