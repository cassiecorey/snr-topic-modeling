Wool production drop blamed on drought
The drought is being blamed for an estimated 6 per cent drop in wool production across Australia this season.
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) says the forecast has fallen 27 million kilograms to 434 million, because of a lack of rain, pasture growth, and the fact that there's no end to the drought in sight.
Chairman of AWI's production forecasting committee Dr David James agrees it will be a tough season for growers.
"Partly it's due to the fact that feed production will be down," he said.
"For example ABARE is forecasting that cereal production levels will be down by about 30 per cent and another concern is in fact the capacity of farmers to provide water to their stock, and on top of that of course there are cash flow factors which will make it difficult."
The dry conditions are forcing many sheep farmers to begin their shearing earlier than normal.
And the bigger supply is hurting wool prices, with the market suffering its biggest drop since April.
Tony Kidman from Quality Wool says many farmers can not afford to store wool until prices rise.
"We appear to be having less people holding onto wool at this moment, people looking for more of a cash flow with their wool," he said.
"I think the drought conditions are forcing people to shear a bit earlier and sell their sheep a bit earlier than they have in the past."
International factors are also affecting wool prices.
Bill Cowley from the Australian Wool Network says the market drop is disappointing, especially when the Australian dollar is weaker.
"China do most of their business in US dollars and when we see the US currency fall, we would normally see a firm to slightly dearer market here in Australia, but the bids that are coming from the Chinese at this particular time are getting lower and lower, and there's some resistance to the higher price that they are having to pay in the US," he said.
