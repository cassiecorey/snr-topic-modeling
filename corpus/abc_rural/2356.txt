Stock losses assessed after Vic bushfires
Government inspectors are assessing stock losses after bushfires in eastern Victoria, which have destroyed about 20 houses.
Hundreds of kilometres of fencing, large areas of pasture and sheds have been destroyed in a number of locations in Gippsland and the north-east ranges, including around Toongabbie, Gaffney's Creek and Cooper's creek.
A 48-year-old man died when he fell off a trailer while fighting a fire near Heyfield in Gippsland.
There have been significant stock losses around Dargo, and Angus Hume, from Victoria's Department of Primary Industries, says farmers need to be ready for more fire fronts in coming days.
"You really must make sure that you have water provided for stock and feed if you have them in containment areas and just those general things that are about planning beforehand," he said.
