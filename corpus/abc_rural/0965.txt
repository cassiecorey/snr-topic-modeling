Snowy inquiry head attacks 'secrecy culture'
The head of a New South Wales Government inquiry into ongoing public ownership of the Snowy Hydro-Electric Scheme says he is trying to break down a culture of secrecy within the authority.
A proposed $3 billion float of the state and federal-owned power and irrigation provider was scuttled in the wake of public protest last month.
At a hearing in the Snowy Mountains town of Cooma yesterday, inquiry chairman Gordon Moyes said he heard evidence of a systematic, long-term lack of transparency by Snowy Hydro.
"There's been an absolute failure in terms of communication, not just recently, it's been a culture that's come to us from evidence for at least 20 years," he said.
"Who told them not to communicate, who actually authorised the change in nature of the company's businesses?
"They are very significant and important questions and will determine the results of the inquiry."
The final report is due on October 27.
