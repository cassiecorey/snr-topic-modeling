AWB announces restructure
Wheat exporter AWB has announced a further restructure to improve transparency but says it is not a result of the oil-for-food scandal.
Under the plan AWB International, which holds the licence for the single desk for exports, will be further separated from the company's corporate division.
It will have an independent board and management team, and its own governance and committee structure.
AWB chairman Brendan Stewart says the change is a result of feedback from grower groups and growers and is not a knee-jerk reaction to the Cole inquiry.
"These changes that we are making have absolutely nothing to do with the Cole inquiry, these are changes that we have initiated 18 months ago," he said.
"They have been a long time coming, they have been a process of detailed analysis and impact so that we delivered on the key promise that we gave to growers."
Mr Stewart rejects any suggestions from grower groups that it is too little too late.
"I don' think that's the case at all," he said.
Grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says there are major flaws in the restructure because the wheat sales division will not be part of AWB International and still will not be accountable enough.
"One of the implications is that the situation we've seen with the Iraq inquiry and the scandal there, and potentially the allegations of other payments being made in other market places, basically that could still happen again and put the single desk at risk with no control over the situation by AWB," he said.
AWB has rejected the suggestions.
Meanwhile AWB has cut its estimated before-tax profit by between 20 to 25 per cent.
The company says the drought has led to lower merchandise and fertiliser sales, and results have also been affected by difficult ongoing trading conditions and volatile world markets.
Profits for the year ending September 30 are expected to drop from a forecast $184.5 million to around $140 million.
