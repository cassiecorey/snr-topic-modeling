AWB seeks to confidential protect documents
Monopoly wheat exporter AWB is trying to stop the oil-for-food inquiry accessing more than 1,300 confidential documents it says are protected by legal privilege.
Barrister Melissa Perry told the Federal Court AWB's privilege claim has risen since May, when it first submitted its list of secret documents.
AWB is arguing that the new amendment to the Royal Commissions Act allowing Commissioner Terence Cole to inspect the confidential documents is unconstitutional and will cause the head of the Cole Inquiry to be in contempt if he examines them.
