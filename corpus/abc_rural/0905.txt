Tax Office focuses on timber plantation records
Companies involved in managed investment schemes are under pressure to get crops in the ground before midnight to meet end of financial year deadlines.
Staff from the Australian Tax Office have been hovering around timber plantations in the far north of Western Australia to confirm paddock plantings match the accounting books.
Tom Cullity from Tropical Forestry Services says his company had a last minute scare with the Tax Commissioner at the door and the discovery that two hectares of indian sandalwood was not accounted for.
"Bearing in mind that the Tax Department was coming up today we thought really we'd better do something," he said.
"I came up and had a look at it and there was obviously a gap there, and said 'hey boys what are we going to do about this' and they all said unprintable words and off we went.
