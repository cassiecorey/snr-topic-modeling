Cane smut found on Qld property
Authorities have confirmed the discovery of the exotic disease sugar cane smut at a farm near Childers, in south-east Queensland.
At the start of another cane crush, it is a massive blow to the sector, which has been enjoying good prices.
The infected property has been quarantined and wider surveillance is underway.
Property owner Joe Russo, who is also the chairman of the Isis District Canegrowers, says it has been a horrible time.
"Not only myself, but the whole family, are quite devastated to hear the news," he said.
"There's no doubt we've all understood the disasterous effects smut can bring, but to have it recorded not only in your district, then to have it on your own property, is of a concern."
The entire cane crop on the east coast will be inspected for the disease.
Queensland has been one of only a few commercial growing regions in the world without cane smut, which can cause major production losses.
Eoin Wallis from research group BSES Limited says the situation is extremely serious, even though only one infected plant has been found.
"At the moment, because we haven't found anymore plants, we are not able to say whether this is a widespread infestation or simply quite local," he said.
