Water protection effort doesn't go far enough: farmer
The Federal Government's new effort to protect water resources is being criticised for not going far enough.
An Office of Water Resources will be established within the Prime Minister's department to provide and coordinate national water policy.
But Victorian farmer Mark Wootton, whose family has donated $10 million for a new Climate Institute that's been launched today, says the broader issue of climate change needs to be addressed.
