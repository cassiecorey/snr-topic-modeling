Rival bids leave Sedimentary's future uncertain
The future of a gold miner with exploration interests at Foster and Walhalla in Victoria remains uncertain, with shareholders offered both a merger and a takeover bid.
Sedimentary complained to the National Takeovers Panel last week that there were unacceptable circumstances around a takeover bid by Auselect.
Now Sedimentary has announced a merger agreement with Premier Gold Mines.
The takeovers panel has decided it will not pursue Sedimentary's complaint about the takeover bid.
