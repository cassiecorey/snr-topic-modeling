Govt urged to dump GST on school boarders' food
There is a call today for the Federal Government to dump the GST on food for boarding school students to bring down costs for struggling country families.
Gary Le Duff from the Association of Independent Schools in South Australia says rural families which send their children to boarding schools should be entitled to financial assistance.
He says the current application of GST for schools is different to other institutions.
"There is an anomaly where boarding food is actually charged GST but if you're in a hostel or staying a hospital there's no GST," he said.
