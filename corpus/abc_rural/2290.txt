Local community loses out
The economic impact of the drought is hitting home in one small community in southern New South Wales.
The Temora Shire Council says many local grain growers have not harvested a crop this year, costing the region about $100 million in lost income.
Mayor Peter Speirs says when farmers stop spending, the whole town suffers.
"It will be very hard for some of our businesses, there will probably be rationalisation of staff in some areas," he said.
