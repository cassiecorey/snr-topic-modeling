Ancient drought blamed for megafauna destruction
A group of researchers say a series of massive droughts 40,000 years ago wiped out Australia's megafauna.
It had been previously thought that over-hunting was to blame.
Palaeontologist Dr Gilbert Price has dug up the fossils of giant kangaroos, emus and wombats the size of cars in south-east Queensland.
He says the remains show the populations had been under stress because of dry conditions, which could provide clues to helping smaller wildlife species today.
"There's so many interesting ecological events that have occurred in the past and these events are recorded in places like the Darling Downs in the fossil record," he said.
