BEE INDUSTRY BUZZING
Beekeepers in eastern Australia are having mixed fortunes.
The eucalypts are bursting with flowers and nectar in southern New South Wales, but low world prices, bushfires and drought are hurting.
Seventy per cent of Australian honey comes from eucalypts, and right now the gums in the Southern Tablelands are full of flowers.
Doug Sommerville with the NSW Department of Primary Industries says it's in response to a break after the last drought and the intensity of this one: "The fellas are making good honey right now, off snow gum, yellow box, red gum, all in the nice quality honey".
But he says disaster is imminent with the drought continuing and beekeeper Greg Roberts says the fires of 2001 and now are devastating.
"It takes many, many years for species such as stringybark to come back after fire."
With low world honey prices, Australian beekeepers are switching from exporting honey to exporting live bees to the US, under the free trade agreement.
