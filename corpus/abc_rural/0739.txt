Water shortage threatens lettuce supplies
Production of Australian lettuces could drop by up to 60 per cent by Septelettuce shortagember because of a lack of water in storages outside Melbourne.
Southern Rural Water has cut water allocations to the Bacchus Marsh and Werribee irrigation districts to between zero and 5 per cent, leaving growers without water, or using recycled waste water.
One of Victoria's biggest coloured lettuce growers, Frank Ruffo, says the both domestic and export supplies will be hit.
"We use all our water for growing lettuce, salads," he said.
We supply on a national basis around Australia and we also supply overseas so that is going to ruin our export markets, especially when we've managed to take them off the American suppliers.
