Irrigation charge increase expected to hurt farmers
Many New South Wales irrigators look set to pay more for the delivery of their water.
The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has released a draft report proposing significant increases to bulk water charges.
The impact will vary across the State but Murray Irrigation is expecting charges to rise by 80 per cent over four years.
General manager George Warne says that is going to hurt farmers.
"Governments don't realise that we've been beaten up by four or five years of drought," he said.
