Former station to provide haven for protected species
A former 63,000 hectare pastoral station in South Australia's north-east has been opened as a conservation park.
Boolcoomatta Station has been bought by the Federal Government and the Nature Foundation of South Australia to protect endangered bird life and flora.
Doug Humann from the Australian Bush Heritage Fund, which will manage the property, says it is a unique bioregion.
"It's a property that embraces vegetation systems and land types that are very poorly reserved in Australia," he said.
"It contains vulnerable species like the plains wanderer, a bird and we hope in future yellow footed rock wallabies.
