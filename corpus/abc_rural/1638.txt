US stint primes firefighters for summer
Fire crews are preparing for an early fire season, with several blazes flaring up around the country this week.
But 45 Australian and New Zealand firefighters are just returning from the frontline in the US, after spending the winter fighting fires during one of the worst North American fire seasons in decades.
Victorian firefighter Dennis Matthews says it has helped them to be ready for this summer.
"It's kept them in tune and switched them on earlier than they would have switched on," he said.
