Frost devastates Goulburn Valley fruit
Fruit prices could be set to rise, with one of Australia's main stone fruit growing regions devastated by a severe frost.
Victoria's Goulburn Valley, which is home to the nation's largest fruit processor SPC Ardmona, will lose an estimated $70 million this harvest.
Ian Bolitho from Fruit Growers Victoria says up to half of the 300,000 tonnes of fruit grown in the region has been wiped out.
"All the apricots have gone, they showing signs of starting to shrivel and drop off now, at least 50 per cent of the plum crop is gone and probably most of the nectarine crop, and probably 50 per cent of the peach crop," he said.
"We're just assessing on the fresh pears at the moment but they're not looking all that flash either."
Growers are now asking why the weather bureau did not give them any warning of the Sunday night frost.
An Internet-based forecasting service was set up in 2003 after a similar frost caused widespread damage.
But there was no warning issued on Sunday night.
Kevin Parkyn from the bureau says that was a mistake.
"I think the system is a good one. I think it's exceptional," he said.
"Unfortunately we missed this case which doesn't look good on our track record.
"As I said it sometimes can be a very fine line particularly with such intense vigorous windy conditions on the Sunday to have it drop out so rapidly is very unusual."
Elsewhere, growers say they do not expect to see major increases in the price of fruit, but believe the market will be affected.
Sympathetic Queensland grower Pat Wibaux says it is not the first time the weather has caused a disaster.
"It's not something that someone likes to see happen, but it occasionally does," he said.
