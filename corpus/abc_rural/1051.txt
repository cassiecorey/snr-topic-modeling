In South Australia, widespread rain is expected to keep the state's harvest on track for a bumper season.
The top readings was at Maralinga in the far west with 65 millimetres, but while most farmers are saying it is the most significant rain they've received all year, others missed out.
Rodney Lush from Coombe in the upper south-east was pinning his hopes on a good rain after suffering a dry June and heavy frosts.
"It hasn't been heavy rain, it's barely been drizzle a lot of the time, it's only made things damp, it certainly hasn't wetted things, barely enough to get my pasture growth going again and it's certainly not enough let us go sowing lucerne with any confidence," he said.
