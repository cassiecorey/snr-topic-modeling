Govt urged to take control over vegetable imports
Unions in Tasmania are calling for the Federal Government to take greater control over vegetable imports to save Australia's processing industry.
About 10 jobs are expected to be lost at a McCain Foods' plant in north-west Tasmania because of a loss of sales.
Anne Urquart from the Manufacturing Workers Union says imports, a rise in home brands and a lack of country-of-origin labelling is putting processors under pressure.
"I'm really concerned since it's only 12 months since the farmers had a very large rally that identified the concern about not only the labelling but the actual importing of frozen vegetables," she said.
