Kalgoorlie lacking gold treatment facilities, conference told
Treatment mills in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia are working overtime to turn as much ore into gold bars to take advantage of record gold prices.
This week the Kalgoorlie region is hosting the Diggers and Dealers conference, attended by some of the world's leaders in the resource sector.
Analyst Dr Sandra Close has told the conference that local plants cannot keep up with the amount of gold being dug up to ship overseas.
"One of the actual problems we are actually seeing - I guess, in a way, it is a good problem to have - and that is there is a lack of gold treatment facilities in the Kalgoorlie area,' she said.
