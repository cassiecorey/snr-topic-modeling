Beef prices predicted to stay high
The outlook for the cattle industry remains bright, despite the lingering drought and the return of US beef exports to North Asia.
In its latest projections, Meat and Livestock Australia says beef prices should stay at their current high levels because exports and domestic consumption are set to rise.
Chief market analyst Peter Weeks says producers are continuing to pay top prices for grazing land, with production set for a record high next year.
"Rarely seen such a buoyant period, you've really had four or five years where the industry has been what you could describe as buoyant," he said.
"We've had this time round, we've got record prices, we've got near record production and we're thinking by 2:30 we might even have record production.
