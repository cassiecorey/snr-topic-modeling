Rain dance invoked for drought relief
In an effort to break the drought, a woman in South Australia who describes herself as an Aboriginal spiritual adviser, is planning to travel the country hosting rain dances.
Inspired by a rain dance staged in the Victorian town of Ouyen in 2003, Angelina Harradine says she will help to organise community ceremonies.
"Myself and my team will travel all over Australia," she said.
"There are processes that are used, those processes are very sacred, they're shared with people with respect.
"I don't sit down here and think this is all fun and games.
