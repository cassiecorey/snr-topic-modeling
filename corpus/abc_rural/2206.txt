Agriculture sector remains largest water user
The Australian Bureau of Statistics says agriculture is still the biggest sector user of water in Australia but consumption has fallen by 23 per cent since 2001.
The new water report says farmers and the domestic sector have both responded to the drought, with householders reducing their water consumption by 8 per cent.
Michael Vardon from the bureau says farmers have been particularly responsive to reduced water supplies by planting less demanding crops.
"Certainly cotton and rice were large users in 2002 to 2001 and they continue to be in 2004-2005 but the water use has declined, water use has declined substantially in those industries," he said.
