Foreign buyers warn Australian sheep too expensive
Overseas buyers of live sheep are complaining that Australian livestock prices are too high.
In the Middle East, importers are warning that live sheep from countries like Somalia and India are constantly undercutting Australian mutton in the marketplace.
Jasem Al Dhahi from the Emirates Livestock and Meat Trading Company in Dubai says the price of Australian sheep has jumped four times in the past month, and his customers are looking elsewhere.
"In the last four ships now, the prices get high, high, high," he said.
"I cannot in the future buy more sheep from Australia. In the past maybe I buy 15,000, the next ship I will say send me 7,000."
Meanwhile, another shipload of Australian live sheep has just been unloaded at the port of Jebel Ali, near Dubai.
About 12,000 are now being held at one of the Middle East's most modern feedlots.
The feedlot is one of the most advanced facilities of its type in the Middle East.
The conditions are extremely hot at 50 degrees in the sun, but under the 34 hectares of shadecloth it is a more respectable 45 degrees Celcius.
When full, the housing facility can accommodate about 90,000 Australian sheep.
The most recent shipment arrive after a 16-day journey from Fremantle, with no evidence of foot soreness or too much heat stress, and are fed water that is specially cooled by big refrigeration units.
