Injury won't stop baton runner
A southern Queensland cattle farmer says a knee injury will not stop him running in the Queen's baton relay today in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games.
Stanthorpe's Bill Bonner travelled to Coffs Harbour in New South Wales to run his leg of the relay.
And he says injury will not prevent him from making the 500 metre dash.
"About two weeks ago I was jumping off my motorbike and twisted a ligament in my knee and I haven't been able to do more than walk since," he said.
"But I promise you I will run that baton because you get such an adrenalin rush that I think you could only have one leg and you could still run it."
