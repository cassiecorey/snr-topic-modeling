Govt may extend drought assistance
The Federal Government is considering extending its drought assistance in the face of worsening conditions across many states.
It says the current system was set up to deal with one or two-year droughts rather than the series of dry years farmers have faced.
The federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, says the Government is worried that farmers in areas where there has been some rain are slipping through cracks in the system, so changes are being considered.
"We don't believe now with the failed spring any of those areas have any possibility of recovery, so rather than wait until they meet another criteria, we should be able to move them straight into drought declaration," Mr McGauran said.
But the Opposition's agriculture spokesman, Gavin O'Connor, says the Government has been too slow to act.
"Even in EC declared areas, only 13 per cent of farmers have ever accessed these particular provisions."
The Government says planned changes will make it easier for areas to become drought declared for EC assistance.
It says they will stop rainfall in one district ruling out help for a whole region and allow EC declarations to last longer than 12 months.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says the current drought emergency requires immediate intervention.
Chief executive Ben Fargher says the politicians are now aware farmers are not whingeing, but looking for targeted measures to deal with the crisis.
"We need to make sure that EC program is working as well as it could," he said.
"We would also like the government to consider further changes to EC about some eligibility criteria, lifting caps on interest rate subsidy assistance and some technical matters like that.
