NLIS program chief defends rollout
The head of the committee in charge of implementing the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) has defended the time it is taking to roll it out.
That is despite just one state so far - Victoria - having mandatory NLIS without any exemptions.
The NLIS is a national program designed to allow all cattle to be traced from paddock to plate.
The chairman of the national NLIS executive committee, John Wilde, says the rollout has exceeded expectations.
"We are well into the implementation phase and it's performing really well, it's exceeding our expectations. It will obviously be a number of years before the implementation phase is finally washed through. But we are very very pleased with the progress to date," he said.
Meanwhile, Linda Hewitt, the chairwoman of the Australian Beef Association, which is lobbying against the NLIS, says cattlemen were better off without the scheme.
