Mining losses a correction, say analysts
The mining sector has had a rough couple of days, with metal prices falling sharply on the commodity markets overnight.
Copper was the biggest loser, at one stage falling 9 per cent, with gold down 4 per cent, and silver 5 per cent.
But analysts say it is not a global market meltdown, merely a long overdue correction on the minerals boom.
Malcolm Condie, from AWB Landmark, says the mining sector has taken the biggest battering, and agricultural commodities should escape relatively unscathed.
He says the fundamentals for wool prices are unchanged, the poor US crop has strengthened wheat prices and demand from Asia and India for other agricultural commodities will continue to strengthen.
"I don't see any further risk or downside risk for wool at this stage," he said.
"We might see the market just tread water for a little while now.
"Obviously grain, wheat is on a bit of an upward spiral and I mean generally there is no correlation between those and the other mineral commodities that we export. But obviously as far as food stuffs go people have to eat and I think we are going to see a lot more going into Asia."
Rising inflation fears in the US have largely contributed to the weaker commodity prices.
The All Ordinaries Index had fallen 93 points at the close of trade yesterday, with bulk-commodity companies like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto the hardest hit.
Chris Monroe of Hartleys says it was the correction the market, "had to have."
"Another cliche, the market was, "priced to perfection" I think," he said.
