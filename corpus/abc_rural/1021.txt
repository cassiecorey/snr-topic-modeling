Frost damage blamed for drop in orange crop
South Australia's navel orange crop will be down by as much as 30,000 tonnes due to frost damage.
Industry officials say the crop could come in at between just 45,000 and 50,000 tonnes.
Other varieties including mandarins, lemons, tangelos and grape fruit have also suffered significant losses.
Citrus Crop Estimates Committee spokesman Kym Thiel says more damage could still appear.
"For some individuals there may be 100 per cent loss, for others it may only be a certain percentage," he said.
