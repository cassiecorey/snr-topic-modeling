Wheat prices fall as panic buying eases
After a bullish run, wheat prices have fallen around $50 a tonne on the domestic market.
Widespread panic buying by millers and feedlotters has eased, with the market falling heavily as more of the nation's crop is harvested.
Chairman of AWB International Ian Donges says there has been a reduction in tender activity and the cash price.
"I noticed back when the harvest started in southern Queensland the market was roughly between $300 and $330-$340 a tonne," he said.
