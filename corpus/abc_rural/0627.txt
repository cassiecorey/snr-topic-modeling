Beef industry helps out in quake recovery effort
The Australian beef industry is helping with the recovery in quake-hit Yogyakarta in Java.
Feedlotters, including the Consolidated Pastoral Company's Indonesian Joint Venture, are among those helping fund aid for 100,000 homeless people.
Nurendro Trikesowo of the Indonesian Cattle and Buffalo Farmers Association says he is installing 20 health clinics and 20 simple water filters this week.
"That is just a pocket filter system, using some ceramic filters, to make the purification of the water, filtering the water from [toxic bacteria such as] E. coli," he said.
"That is an important thing, that the water will be hygienic to drink for the people. [But] we are just a small part because they need a lot of funds for the recovery and reconstruction.
