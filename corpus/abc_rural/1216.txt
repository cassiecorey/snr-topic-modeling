Analyst says wool market performing well
Elders says the wool market has performed well against the rising Australian dollar in the first sales after a three-week recess.
The eastern market indicator fell five cents to 741 cents a kilogram this week, with 47,000 bales of wool on offer in Sydney and Fremantle.
In Western Australia the indicator fell by 11 cents to 716 cents a kilogram.
Wool analyst David Fogg says it is surprising there was not a bigger fall, given the two cent rise in the Australian dollar.
"We really thought, particularly at the fine end, that we were going to see at least 20 and perhaps 30 come off prices, but what we saw in fact with the fine wools was 10 to 15 on the first day," Mr Fogg said.
