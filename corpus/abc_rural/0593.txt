WEA's days may be numbered, boss says
The head of Australia's wheat export watchdog has conceded his agency could be abolished after the oil-for-food Inquiry.
Wheat Export Authority (WEA) chairman Tim Besley told a marathon senate estimates hearing nothing would be the same after the Cole inquiry and pleaded for the role of any future body to be made clearer.
"My plea to anyone who's changing the act is for goodness sake make it clear just precisely what the role of the Wheat Export Authority or its successor body may have," he said.
Senators at the hearing also attacked WEA chief executive Glen Taylor over his pay package, age and qualifications.
Liberal Jeannie Ferris wanted to know why wheat growers paid Mr Taylor $350,000 last year.
"Mr Taylor earns more than the Prime Minister which is quite a remarkable feat I would have thought," he said.
