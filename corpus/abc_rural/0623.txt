Raspberry levy to go into marketing
Raspberry growers across Australia will have to pay a new industry levy from July 1 to cover costs of more research and development.
The $13 million industry is set to be boosted by the 10 cents a kilo levy, which will be collected by wholesale agents and supermarkets, and imposed on exported berries.
