Average rainfall expected right across Australia
The Bureau of Meteorology says most of Australia looks set for average rainfall over the next three months, although the north-east could be drier.
The bureau says there is a 60 to 80 per cent chance of below average rain in the region from Daly Waters in the Northern Territory, south to the corner country and across to Rockhampton in Queensland.
Elsewhere there is a 50 per cent chance of at least average rainfall between August and October.
