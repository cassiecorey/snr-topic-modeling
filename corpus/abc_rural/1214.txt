Significant diamond find prompts mining hopes
Diamond mining in South Australia's Flinders Ranges is a step closer after the discovery of 30 diamonds.
Resources company Flinders Diamonds has been exploring the region for the past five years, but this is its most significant find.
Managing director Dr Kevin Wills says other results are yet to be studied, but so far the news is good.
"Each of these samples we're treating has got the chance of being an economic sample," he said.
"Soon as we get to that stage, then we'll convert to doing a feasibility study rather than an exploration program and that's what we trying to find.
