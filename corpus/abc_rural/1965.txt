Labor hits out at pay rise for GRDC boss
The Federal Government-funded Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) is under fire, for awarding its managing director a $60,000 pay rise during the drought.
The GRDC has admitted to a Senate estimates hearings that managing director Peter Reading's salary was increased to $460,000 this year, but says it was after a salary review by an independent body.
Labor's agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor says the Government should be ashamed.
"I think it's important that some sensitivity in judgment is exercised when wage rises or salary rises of this kind are granted," he said.
