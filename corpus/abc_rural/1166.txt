Qld unveils $1bn Toowoomba-Gladstone rail link
The Queensland Government has committed a billion dollars to complete a railway link between Toowoomba and the expanding central port of Gladstone.
Premier Peter Beattie says the 200 kilometres of rail will solve a "missing link" in the state's rail system.
It will mainly be used to transport billions of tonnes of coal from the Stuart Basin to port, but Everald Compton from the Australian Inland Expressway Project says grain growers will also benefit.
"Twenty million tonnes of coal a year will go out on the line but in addition it will mean that all the grain crops, the cotton and beef and all types of products can also use the port of Gladstone, which they are unable to do now," he said.
