Pulp mill development headed for courts
Landholders opposing a $650 million pulp mill development in South Australia will take their case to the courts.
The development, near Penola in the state's south-east, was conditionally approved by the South Australian Government last month, subject to further checks by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Lawyer Peter Humphries, acting for 30 landholders, says he will be asking the Supreme Court to review all aspects of the application process.
"There's been no environmental impact study done," he said.
