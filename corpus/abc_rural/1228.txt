Poor season affects lupin numbers
Western Australian lupin growers are worried that poor seasonal conditions will cut this season's production by two-thirds.
Farmers need to grow enough lupins each year to fill long standing overseas contracts, hold enough over to plant the following year and supply the domestic livestock industry.
With lupins fetching $300 a tonne to meet strong feed demand in the west, Alan Meldrum from Pulse Australia fears there will now be a lack of seed to plant next season.
"It's obviously a very ordinary season, there's not much production going to be happening from lupins in 2006 and the biggest concern is the great northern area where a lot of lupins are produced on an annual basis," he said.
