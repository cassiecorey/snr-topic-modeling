Wool growers want to postpone wool levy vote
The Australian Wool Growers Association will ask the Federal Government to delay an industry vote on the future of the wool levy.
This year's Woolpoll is asking growers to support an ongoing 2 per cent levy to fund research, development and marketing by Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
But with AWI planning a merger with Australian Wool Services, the association's Martin Oppenheimer says growers need more information about the new organisation before they can make a decision.
"At the moment in the current climate there's no way that wool growers are going to be able to afford extra levies," he said.
"What they want to be able to do is to split their levies between research and marketing.
