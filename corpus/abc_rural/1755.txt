Irrigators accreditation course to help improve image
For the first time, a national accreditation course will be available for irrigators to help improve their image as water users.
The Irrigation Association of Australia has introduced the national industry standard, which covers five minimum skills that people need to work in the sector.
Farmers who have taken part in other training schemes can also gain accreditation.
Chief executive Jolyon Burnett hopes it will reduce inefficient water management practices.
"Many farmers are still scheduling their irrigation by the tried and true old method of wandering out into the paddock, kicking the dirt, having a look to see how moist it is and then making a subjective judgment on how much water to apply," he said.
