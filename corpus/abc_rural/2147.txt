Drought set to bring live export trade growth
The Australian live export trade is tipped to grow because of the drought.
Lower prices for sheep and cattle have prompted international markets to step up demand for livestock which fell away after the Cormo Express incident in 2003 and more expensive livestock costs.
Meat and Livestock Australia spokesman Mike Hayward says despite low prices the trade does give producers another alternative during the dry times.
"It was really noticeable in the west when they really got hit with the drought early in the year," he said.
"A lot of livestock would have probably died on properties if they hadn't had the live trade.
