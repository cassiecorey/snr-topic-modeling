Country students falling behind in maths, science
Primary school principals says rural students are falling behind in maths and science because of a shortage of teachers.
The National Centre of Science and Maths says country pupils fall further behind city students, the further they live from a major city.
Leonie Trimper from the Australian Primary Principals Association says rural schools need specific funding to help them attract and keep specialist teachers.
