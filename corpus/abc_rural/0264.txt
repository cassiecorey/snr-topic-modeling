Extreme weather events affecting rural commodities outlook
Cyclones and hurricanes continue to affect the outlook for rural commodities across mining, wheat and sugar markets.
The latest Commodity Price Index from the National Australia Bank is predicting a slight easing in rural prices over the next two years, with sugar, beef, wheat and cotton all expected to perform well.
Agribusiness economist Skye Dixon says extreme weather events have a big affect on rural prices.
"They do certainly have an impact because so much of rural commodity prices is derived from what's happening with supply," she said.
