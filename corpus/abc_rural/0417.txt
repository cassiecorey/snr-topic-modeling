Fruit growers attend crisis summit
Australia's summerfruit industry is drafting an action plan to try to keep producers in business.
Peach, nectarine, plum, apricot and apple growers are battling cheap imports and a lack of export sales since access to Taiwan was restricted last season.
Fruit growers are still thrashing out the details at a crisis summit in Melbourne, but Heather Chong from Summerfruit Australia says some priorities are emerging.
