Mine company ordered to pay former exec compo
A Western Australian mining company has been ordered to pay more than $1.8 million to a former senior executive, after failing to disclose a nickel discovery.
The Supreme Court of Western Australia yesterday awarded the money to Kim Riley, a former managing director and shareholder of Jubilee Mines.
In late 1994, rival company Western Mining Corporation told Jubilee Mines it had inadvertently found the nickel deposit on Jubilee's tenement in the northern goldfields.
However Jubilee Mines did not publicly provide information of the find until two years later.
In that time, Mr Riley sold his entire holding in the company.
He says he would have been in a different position about selling the shares if he had known about the discovery.
"I've got mixed emotions, I am very relieved," he said.
"It was a stressful period for myself, also for my wife and children, I'm glad that it's over."
