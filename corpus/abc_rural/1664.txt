Sorghum prices rise
As concerns mount about feed grain supplies across Australia, sorghum prices have jumped nearly 20 per cent in a fortnight.
Sorghum is a major component of rations for cattle and pigs in feedlots.
Jim Cudmore, at Kerwee feedlot in southern Queensland, says his feed prices are now rising exponentially and that is already influencing competitiveness in countries like Japan.
"Our customers have been telling us for some time now that we are starting to lose our price competitiveness, in terms of product into that market," he said.
