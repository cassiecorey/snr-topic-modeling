Traditional owners decry mine expansion approval
Environmental approval has been granted for the expansion of the McArthur River Mine in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The conversion of the zinc and lead mine to open-cut involves moving the McArthur River five kilometres.
Despite the green light and the promise of a substantial environmental management bond, local traditional owners still oppose the move.
Spokesman Jack Green says talk of local training programs is not enough.
"It's the main river ... we [have] culture and ceremony and sacred site tied up on that river," he said.
"If they're going to change it and that's going to really make us upset, really worried about it.
"It's going to bugger up the song line, the dreaming line you know.
"It's bad enough already."
