Aileron residents don sombreros for Mexican mutton chase
It is not often you see Mexicans swilling tequila and riding donkeys in central Australia.
But this weekend at the bush carnival at Aileron, 130km north of Alice Springs, you had better be prepared to don a sombrero.
While the adults gulp down beans and tequila and race donkeys, organiser Sarah Debney says it is sheep that people really want to see.
"That's the Mexican mutton chase...we've got teams of two children and the team puts on their ponchos and hats and they run down the other end and do the same scull with water and baked beans, run back and we let sheep out of the shoots and they have to herd the sheep over the line," she said.
