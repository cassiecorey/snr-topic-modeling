Algae project wins renewable energy grant
A Queensland company trying to produce biodiesel from algae is among the recipients of $10.5 million in federal grants for renewable energy projects.
Energy Minister Ian Macfarlane says Brisbane company SQC is getting $220,000 for its work with algae.
"The algae produces an oil extract which can then be used for biodiesel," he said.
The company wants to commercialise a process which could be suitable for farm dams and irrigation lagoons.
The biggest grant recipient is CSR Sugar's centre at the University of Queensland, which has received $5 million for work to produce a new sugarcane with more fermentable sugar suitable to ethanol and biofuels.
