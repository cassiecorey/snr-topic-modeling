Horticulturalists fear loopholes in proposed code of conduct
Sections of the horticulture industry say they still have concerns about the mandatory code of conduct due to be tabled in Federal Parliament.
The code is designed to improve transparency between growers and wholesalers but Ian Hay from Cherrygrowers of Australia says many producers have not had a chance to see the draft legislation.
He says many are worried that there will be too many loopholes for buyers operating outside the central markets.
"The hard part is that when things get tabled in Parliament they can quite easily become law and we have no recourse to change it," he said.
