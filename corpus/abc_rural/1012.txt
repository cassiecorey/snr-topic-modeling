US researchers to grow crops on Mars
Researchers in the United States are running trials to see if crops can be grown on the planet Mars.
NASA plans to send astronauts to Mars to set up a planetary base, a mission which could last at least three years.
Researchers at the University of Florida are looking at which crops might be grown hydroponically on the shuttle during the trial and also in greenhouses on Mars to provide food for the astronauts.
Professor of food engineering Arthur Teixeira says results have been successful.
"I believe research is now available to show that we could probably rely on being able to grow certain varieties of rice, dry beans, soy beans and sweet potato," he said.
