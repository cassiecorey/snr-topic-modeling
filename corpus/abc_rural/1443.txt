Audits find mutton labelled as lamb
Three abattoirs have been told to clean up their act, after being caught processing mutton as lamb.
The industry watchdog AusMeat uncovered the breaches in Victoria and New South Wales during regular audits.
The authority cannot confirm how much meat headed for the domestic market has been wrongly labelled.
Chief executive Ian King now wants all animals assessed before processing, instead of the current 10 per cent sample.
"Back in 1991 there was actually a standard under an AusMeat advice that actually required all ovine animals to be assessed," he said.
