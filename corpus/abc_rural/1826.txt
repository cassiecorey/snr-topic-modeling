Aust producers may gain ground in US restaurant trade: analyst

Australia's disease free status, reputation for quality and the National Livestock Identification Scheme should help Australia sell more beef to the restaurant trade rather than the traditional hamburger market.
The publisher of the US-based Cattle Buyers Weekly, Steve Kay, has this encouraging message for Australian producers.
