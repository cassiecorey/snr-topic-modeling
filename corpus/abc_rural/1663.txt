PM hits out at Murray Darling Basin efforts
The Prime Minister, John Howard, has accused the Labor governments in the eastern states of not doing enough to address the Murray Darling Basin's environmental problems.
It comes as the Commonwealth sets up a new Office of Water Resources, sparking suggestions it is taking steps to take over control of water from the states.
But Mr Howard says he prefers to cooperate with the states.
"But it's got to be collaboration that makes progress," he said.
"I'm very unhappy with the Murray Darling Basin. I don't think we're going fast enough, I don't think the Queensland, NSW and Victoria has the same interest as South Australia in making progress on that issue.
"And they can't say the Commonwealth is not doing its bit, we put in an extra $500 million out of the last Budget which we weren't really required to."
And 3,000 farmers in Victoria's Wimmera Mallee are expected to be eligible for water tank rebates this year.
As a result of the ongoing dry conditions, Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water will start water carting on Monday.
