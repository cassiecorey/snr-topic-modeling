Farmers confidence falls
Farmer confidence has fallen due to lower demand, rising costs and poor seasonal conditions between April and June.
The latest agribusiness survey by the National Australia Bank says beef, dairy, wheat, sugar and cotton farmers are less positive about the future.
There is more optimism though for the wool and wine industries.
Analyst Skye Dixon says the good news is that recent rainfall has boosted the price outlook for the next year.
"Over the last 12 months, 2005-06 we saw rural commodity prices rise by around 4 per cent," Ms Dixon said.
"This is largely in line with a steep rise in beef and sugar prices," she said.
