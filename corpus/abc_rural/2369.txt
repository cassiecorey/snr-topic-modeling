Farmers assess bushfire damage
As bushfires continue to rage in eastern Victoria, some farmers have had a chance to survey the damage caused by the blaze.
Stock, sheds and houses have been lost so far and landholders are gearing up to protect their properties again as temperatures rise this week.
Gippsland farmers Roger and Kate Bond have lost poultry and sheds, although firefighters managed to save their farm house at Cowwarr and some sheep.
Both are wheelchair-bound and Mr Bond says it is going to take a long time to rebuild.
