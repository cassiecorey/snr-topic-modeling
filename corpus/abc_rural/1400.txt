Water infrastructure upgrades 'waste of time'
The Productivity Commission says federal and state governments are wasting their time trying to save water through infrastructure upgrades.
The 2002 Living Murray Initiative included $500 million funding for better infrastructure to save water.
The water was intended to be released as environmental flows.
But the commission has released a report saying that is expensive, and often detrimental to the environment.
Spokesman Neil Byron wants to see an independent environmental trust set up to buy water from irrigators instead.
