Drivers knowingly take risks: survey
A survey of country drivers has found high rates of complacency when it comes to drink driving, fatigue and speeding.
Insurance group AAMI has interviewed 2,500 motorists about their attitudes to road safety.
It found 40 per cent of people surveyed have probably driven while over the legal alcohol limit.
A third have momentarily fallen asleep at the wheel, while most have exceeded the speed limit.
Professor Craig Veitch, from James Cook University, is involved in a five-year investigation into regional road safety.
He says the figures show education campaigns are not working.
"A lot of people we've spoken with have remembered road safety messages that haven't been used in 10 years - that's the 'bloody idiot' campaign, that's been used," he said.
