Starlings attack cherry orchards
Cherry orchards in central New South Wales are suffering major bird damage this year.
Large numbers of starlings are attacking crops much earlier than normal, which growers believe is due to the drought and a lack of food.
Cherry grower Guy Gaeta says he has never seen so much damage.
"They are getting to the cherries when they are still green," he said.
"Whether it is because they are hungry because of the drought.
"I have never seem them before and everybody in the district is having the same problems. They are not eating the cherries, they are just chopping them off.
"They go to taste them and then they are sour. They pull it off the tree and then they go to another one hoping it is a bit sweeter.
