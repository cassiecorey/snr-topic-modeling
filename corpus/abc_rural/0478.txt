Budget boosts funding for illegal fishing fight
The Federal Government has announced a big crack down on illegal fishing in Australia's northern waters.
The $389 million package is designed to double the number of boats apprehended each year through increased surveillance and patrols, along with improved boat-burning facilities to destroy illegal fishing boats.
Indigenous coastal rangers will also be employed as part of the plan but Gary Ward from the Gulf of Carpentaria Commercial Fishermen's Association says the money is being used in the wrong way.
"Spending this money on Aboriginal communities is very fine but you're talking about a radius of probably 25 kilometres each side of the community," he said.
"Now these boats range widely over the Gulf of Carpentaria, we need more surveillance but we need more active now, the fishing fraternity in the Gulf of Carpentaria that's worked so hard for a sustainable and viable fishery has been left out in the lurch."
