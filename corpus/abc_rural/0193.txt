Citrus growers export returns tipped to fall
Australia's citrus growers will be able export more fruit to the United States this year but returns are tipped to fall.
A larger navel crop is expected this season and 1.9 million cartons of oranges are expected to be exported.
Stuart Monaghan from DNE World Fruit Sales, which imports Australian citrus into the US, says growers will have to accept lower prices to sell the fruit and compete with South Africa.
"We've got to get retail prices in the US down to where consumers will start buying them right away rather than starting off at higher prices," he said.
