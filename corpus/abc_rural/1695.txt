Sports lovers facing big weekend
It is shaping up as a big weekend across the country for sports lovers, with four states battling it out in the AFL and NRL season deciders.
It is a tough weekend for Queensland NRL supporters, faced with backing the local Brisbane Broncos, or a team full of ex-Queenslanders, Melbourne Storm.
But there will be no fence sitting in the north Queensland community of Nebo.
"The Broncos are going to win by at least 12 points and I think the reason they'll win is they'll play 80 minutes of football right through it," one supporter said.
"I hope the Broncos win but I think the Storm will do it, they're just a tough all-round team," another said.
"I'll be with my youngest daughter who's a Melbourne supporter on the night so I'll probably have to go for Melbourne if I want a bed for the night," a resident said
"It'd have to be the Broncos because their Queenslanders," said another.
In WA, AFL supporters are excited about the chances of the West Coast Eagles in their clash against Sydney.
This group of country kids from the state's south reckon the locals will do them proud.
"I reckon they'll win by about five points - three points," one said.
"Just win I reckon - about 10 points," said another.
