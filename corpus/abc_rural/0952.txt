Dry conditions see live sheep exports jump
Dry seasonal conditions in Western Australia have seen a massive jump in live sheep exports from Fremantle.
More than 330,000 sheep were shipped out last month alone.
John Edwards, from the WA Livestock Exporters Association, says there is a direct link between the increase and the weather.
"I guess farmers have sort of looked ahead of themselves as to availability of feed stocks on farm and very little paddock feed," he said.
"They've most probably made the decision to sell sheep early.
"Possibly we've seen a lot of sheep come out now rather than in the spring when they traditionally shear and sell off shears."
Meanwhile, easing cattle prices in the east are providing northern WA producers with competition in the live export trade.
Tony Cooling, from Landmark in Broome, says Queensland producers are now selling stock overseas.
"Queensland prices have come back a bit, so live export is now competing with the domestic market over there," he said.
