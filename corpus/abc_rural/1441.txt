Woolgrowers revise PETA case claim
There has been a new development in the ongoing Federal Court case between Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) and animal rights group PETA.
The 103 woolgrowers supporting the action will now no longer allege that they have suffered a direct economic loss as a result of a PETA campaign.
The case centres on allegations that PETA's actions have reduced sales of wool by spreading negative publicity and misinformation about the wool industry and the practice of mulesing.
Les Targ, from AWI, says the growers are still involved in other parts of the class action.
"What is happening is that those 103 woolgrowers are no longer claiming direct economic loss because of the difficulties of proving that," he said.
"You've got to remember that they say goodbye to their wool at the farm gate and there's about six different owners between them and the retailer that sells the finished product.
