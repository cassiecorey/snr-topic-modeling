Vic Govt to challenge wind farm ban
The Victorian Government will take Federal Court action in a bid to overturn a decision to stop a wind farm development in south Gippsland.
Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell blocked the $220 million project because of a threat to the endangered orange bellied parrot.
While the State Government says the decision was unreasonable local farmer Don Jelbart believes it was the right one.
"They keep coming back to the parrot but there's 17 threatened species there," he said.
