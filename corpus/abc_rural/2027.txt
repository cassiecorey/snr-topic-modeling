Drought hits horse racing studs
Horse racing studs in Victoria say they are being hard hit by the drought.
A lack of spring rains has meant stud owners are buying in feed early this year instead of usually holding off until summer.
Fiona Smith from Nagambie, in central Victoria, says studs are being forced to pass the costs on to customers.
"We've had an increase in feed, feed prices are astronomical at the moment and are affecting us quite badly in regards to the cost of everything," she said.
"Unfortunately we've had to increase a drought levy fee onto our agistment so therefore owners are incurring extra costs."
Meanwhile country race clubs in New South Wales are concerned about their future viability.
Orange-based trainer Brian Cornish says low prizemoney, increased feed costs and high fuel prices are hurting.
"We're trying to get more money here. Everyone is working hard to try and get it for us," he said.
"That is the only way we will survive on the cost of living here today and training horses.
"The expense of it is getting astronomical now. The thing of it is they want all the money to go to Sydney. That's where they want the money for them down there, they're not worried about us very much here.
