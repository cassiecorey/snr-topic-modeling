Tas shellfish industry consolidating
Tasmania's shellfish industry is facing significant generational change, with many family operations selling up or merging.
Richard Pugh, the general manager of Shellfish Cultures, says Tasmania's oyster industry is now more than 30 years old and many farmers are reaching retirement age.
He says a cost price squeeze and the difficulties of recruiting new farmers is leading a push towards consolidation.
"Farms [are] just moving towards getting economies of scale," he said.
"We're finding that we're getting a lot of cost squeezing happening, prices are not rising very quickly.
