SAFF sells building to pay debts
The South Australian Farmers Federation (SAFF) is putting its Adelaide headquarters on the market to try to pay off its debts.
SAFF has been in financial strife for a number of years and falling membership numbers have made it difficult to stay afloat.
General manager Carol Vincent says the sale of the building will put SAFF back on track.
"The sale of the building will fix the whole thing, it'll pay off the debt," she said.
"They'll have enough money to buy another building and a number of hundreds of thousands of dollars left to invest in whatever way they see fit to give them reserves.
