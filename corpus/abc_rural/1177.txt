Herbicide used to poison crops, police say
Police in north Queensland have confirmed that the common herbicide glyphosate was used to poison up to 40 hectares of fruit and vegetable crops near Bowen.
A special Queensland Government task force has been set up in the region, to find out how the poison, which is commonly known as Roundup, got into the system in the first place.
One million dollars damage has been caused to the crops and police now suspect a water source associated with crop spraying was contaminated.
Detective Inspector Warren Webber says the contamination is being treated as an act of sabotage.
"We obviously have look specifically in relation to which farms etc were being sprayed and that sort of thing," he said.
