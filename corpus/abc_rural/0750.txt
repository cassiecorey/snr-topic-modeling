Farmsafe maintains cancer risks minimised
A farm safety group has defended the sector's use and management of pesticides after a new report said people in agriculture were among the most at risk of developing cancer.
The study by the Queensland Cancer Fund and the University of Sydney found twice as many people as previously thought faced cancer-causing substances at work, including pesticides, UV rays and dust.
But Jamie Cupples from Queensland-based Farmsafe says risks have been greatly minimised because primary producers must go through chemical accreditation programs.
"We haven't had the evidence that there's a huge rate of cancer in the rural industry being caused by pesticides," he said.
