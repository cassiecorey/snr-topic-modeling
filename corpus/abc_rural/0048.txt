Fresh roadkill sought for WA snake study
Roadkill is set to help scientists unlock the largely mysterious world of snakes in the far north of Western Australia.
Travellers are being asked to keep their eyes out for specimens that can be studied.
David Pearson from the Department of Conservation and Land Management says venomous and whip snakes from the Kimberley are of particular interest.
"The thing is they're only useful when they are really fresh," he said.
"For instance if a snake is hit during the night, you get it first thing in the morning or that very night, by the time the sun gets to them and birds of prey and other things like that, they are smelly and a bit putrid - no one wants to see them in their freezer and they certainly don't make good museum specimens!
"If they've been run over a couple of times by a road train, they're not very useful!"
