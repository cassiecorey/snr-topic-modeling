US confident of maintaining Iraq wheat market
Iraq is now America's fourth largest wheat customer and the United States sees continued strong purchases in a market once firmly in Australia's court.
Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns was in Baghdad for farm co-operation meetings with Iraqi officials this week.
And despite an expected strong Iraqi wheat harvest this year, Mr Johanns is confident Iraq will continue as a solid US customer.
"We now have about 72 per cent of the market share. To translate that into numbers, that's about 2.3 tonnes in the 05-06 market year," he said.
