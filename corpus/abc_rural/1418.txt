Western growers experiment with summer crops
While crops in the west are usually grown in the winter months and harvested in the summer months, this year is a bit topsy-turvy.
Some growers are experimenting with summer crops like millet and sorghum to provide more feed for livestock.
Consultant Simon Teakle says seed is relatively cheap and the crops could be a good option for growers struggling through a dry season.
"People have obviously, at the moment, got a shortage of stock feed," he said.
"The type of carrying capacity that forage sorghum and forage millet has is quite large, because of the amount of growth that they get, provided they get sub-soil moisture in there.
