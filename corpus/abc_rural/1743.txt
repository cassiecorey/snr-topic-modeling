Tough conditions may halve Barossa crop
South Australia's famous Barossa wine region could only harvest half its normal volume of grapes this vintage.
A major frost this week has damaged budding vines and comes on top of a lack of rain and reduced water entitlements.
Bob Taplin from the Barossa Winegrape Growers Association says while lower yields might help to reduce the industry's grape glut, it will not help growers because prices are set to stay low.
