Church offers support to stricken farmers
Farmers in the driest parts of Western Australia are hoping for some divine intervention this week.
Anglican Archbishop of Perth Roger Herft and regional Bishop Tom Wilmot are touring the mid-west and wheat belt, to meet with farmers and offer support.
Bishop Wilmot says the turnout has been huge so far.
"One farmer said that it's a bit like grief or having a death in the family, but there's no burial, because every day you stand on the porch and you look out at the body, as it were," he said.
"I can sympathise with that because these people identify very closely with the land. There is a level of grief there, but as with all grief, it draws families together.
