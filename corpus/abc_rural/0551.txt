NSW Govt moves to recruit UK nurses
More overseas trained nurses will soon be hitting Australia's shores, this time from the UK.
The New South Wales Government has adopted a recruitment program similar to one operating in Queensland.
A team is heading to the UK next week to hire 400 nurses, with another 600 being sought from Canada and other parts of Europe.
Dr Ross Maxwell from the Rural Doctors Association says it is easier to check the qualifications rather than those of health professionals from Africa or India.
However he says this is not discrimination.
"I would hope that's not the case and I believe that there are sound reasons to target health professionals where you can be confident of their training," he said.
