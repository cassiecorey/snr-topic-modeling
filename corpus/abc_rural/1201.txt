Senate committee examines petrol collusion claims
Widespread rumours of collusion or price fixing between petrol companies will be examined by a Senate committee in Canberra today.
Chairman of the Senate Economics Committee George Brandis says the inquiry will investigate issues that may contribute to high petrol and diesel prices.
Senator Brandis says the main focus will be trying to uncover the truth about collusion.
"What we want to address, in particular, is the relationship between the oil majors and I am not saying that there are any anti-competitive practices, but there has been suggestion of that going back many years," he said.
"But I think the point to be made is that this suggestion has been about for years but it has never been proved.
"The ACCC has examined the matter and it has never found the existence of anti-competitive conduct."
The committee will also look at the financial viability of ethanol and whether fuel taxes should be reduced.
