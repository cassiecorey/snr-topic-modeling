Plant closure won't affect pig producers: KR Castlemaine
Smallgoods manufacturer KR Castlemaine has told Queensland pig producers it will still need their pork, despite announcing the closure of its Toowoomba processing plant.
The company's adjoining abattoir will be sold.
A total of 350 workers will be affected when processing is relocated to the company's Victorian base.
KR Castlemaine president Mike Adams has promised to help those who are willing to move south.
He says the company will continue to slaughter up to 8,000 pigs from Queensland producers and transport them to Victoria for processing.
"We were faced with the decision of having one modern factory in Castlemaine and one very old factory in Toowoomba and it just did not make economic sense to try and run two plants," he said.
"We'll continue purchasing pigs in Queensland now and into the future.
