Wool price increases predicted
Some good news for the wool industry today, with analysts tipping good price increases in the second half of the year.
Retail demand is down in key markets like the United States and Japan, but economic conditions in most wool consuming countries are forecast to improve, which should see sales pick up.
With most Australian auction centres entering the winter recess, chief economist at Woolmark, Chris Wilcox, says confidence for the rest of the year is high.
"We would expect to see a similar price gain to what we've seen in the first six months," he said.
"It is a fairly positive outlook, in fact Woolmark business survey results, the last survey we did was the most positive we've seen in nearly five years. And I think we'll see more of that in the coming few months."
Meanwhile, the latest figures from Australian Wool Innovation show wool production is set to fall away in Western Australia by about 7 per cent over the next year, with a minor increase in the eastern states.
Although dry conditions are affecting most of the country, sheep numbers are not expected to decline any further.
