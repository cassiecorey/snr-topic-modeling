CSR shares plunge down by 10 pc
Shares in Australia's biggest sugar milling company have crashed almost 10 per cent in a day, after a downgrade in its profit forecast.
CSR Ltd produces 40 per cent of Australia's sugar from seven mills in North Queensland.
The company has told the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) that falling sugar prices and a wet harvest have forced it to reverse earlier predictions that earnings would be up 10 ten per cent.
