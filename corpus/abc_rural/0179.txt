Goat abattoir lays off 140 in quarantine dispute
Australia's largest goat abattoir in western Queensland has temporarily closed to address animal welfare concerns.
In November, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) required repairs to flooring in the abattoir's forcing yards, which were not carried out.
Managing director of Western Exporters Neil Duncan says he has been forced to lay off 140 workers, including 20 Vietnamese workers on special visas.
He says they will be left without an income and without access to Centrelink payments.
"They're not able to access anything, there again we're looking into that at this stage to see how we can help everybody out, they still will be employed by the company but how and where we're going to do it, I'm just not quite sure at this stage," he said.
"We will make every effort to get everybody back to work as soon as possible."
