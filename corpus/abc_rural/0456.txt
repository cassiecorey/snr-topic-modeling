Olive oil shortage drives up prices
South Australian olive growers are looking forward to a bumper harvest this year, with prices up and more orders than oil.
A poor European crop has compounded a worldwide shortage of olive oil, pushing prices up to between$5.50 and $6 a litre.
Olives SA chair, Lisa Rowntree, says even with the higher prices, olive producers will not be able to harvest enough oil to meet demand.
"Sales are fantastic. This is very much a seller's year for olives," she said.
"I've sold everything that I'm responsible for selling in the region and all the other growers as well have sold their olives and we could have sold them probably twice over.
