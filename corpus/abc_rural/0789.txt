More sugar cane smut found in south-east Qld
Surveillance work over the weekend has uncovered more sugar cane smut in south-east Queensland.
The exotic fungal disease that stunts sugar cane has now been found on at least six more properties near Childers.
Unlike the first few identified hot spots, the latest properties to be confirmed quarantined and 'struck' by sugar cane smut are not from the same farms but they are within a few kilometres of the initial discoveries.
Surveillance work is being stepped up throughout the region and the Isis sugar mill has postponed the start of its crush until next week.
Nearby Bundaberg Sugar has put its harvesting on hold, just for the day, to enable its growers to meet and learn more about the disease.
