Australia's highways below standard: survey
The first independent audit of the nation's highways shows half are below standard and may be unsafe to drive on.
The Australian Automobile Association surveyed 18,000 kilometres of the national highway in all states except New South Wales and gave each one a star rating.
Worst on the list were the Bruce Highway on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and the Calder Highway in Victoria between Bendigo and Kyneton.
The association's executive director, Lachlan Macintosh, says half of the highways were rated three stars and more likely to cause deaths.
"In a three star road there are still some deficiencies in the road features; poor median protection, perhaps too many intersections per kilometres of road, poorly designed curves, not enough markings on the road," he said.
"So those three star roads could be better, we could see some pretty inexpensive treatment to make them better and that's fairly important."
