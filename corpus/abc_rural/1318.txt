Authorities mull beef exports with Korea
Two of Australia's biggest beef exporters are meeting with Korean importers on the Gold Coast this week, to discuss ways Australia can sell more beef to the country.
Korea is Australia's third-largest beef market, taking more than 100,000 tonnes last year, but US exports are set to resume after a two-year ban related to mad cow disease.
Meat and Livestock Australia regional manager for Korea, Glen Feist, says Korean supermarkets want more Australian beef and positive news is expected as early as tomorrow.
"For the first time we've actually got two of Australia's major exporters, two of Korea's major importers and Tesco, which is the number two retailer up there with 44 hypermarkets, getting into a room for three days together," he said.
