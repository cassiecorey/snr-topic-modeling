Farmers fire up for Finke fun
Pastoralists south of Alice Springs have a chance to forget about the lack of rain this weekend at the biggest event on their social calendar.
The 31st Finke Desert Race involves hundreds of off road vehicles and motorbikes, tackling a track which starts just south of the Alice, and ends up in the small outback community.
Billy Hayes from Deep Well Station says everyone looks forward to the race as a chance to catch up with family and friends.
"You know there's not too many pastoralists that I know south of Alice that don't take the weekend off to come and watch the Finke Desert Race or, you know, a lot of them have got family or family members competing in it as well," he said.
