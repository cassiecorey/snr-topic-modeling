NSW drought worsens
New South Wales is slipping further back into drought, with 46 per cent of the State now drought declared.
That is up eight percentage points on last month.
Only 20 per cent New South Wales is considered satisfactory for rainfall.
But the State's Primary Industries Minister, Ian Macdonald, says despite worsening conditions, farmers are optimistic about a bigger winter crop than last year.
"The State needs widespread rain particularly in the north but also many areas in the south-west which are major cropping regions need a good downpour fairly quickly," he said.
