Opponents speak out against Qld dam proposal
More than 3,000 people attended a weekend protest rally in the Queensland city of Gympie, to fight the proposed Mary River Dam.
The State Government is planning a 660,000 megalitre dam at Traveston Crossing, south of the city, to supply the water needs of Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast.
The Government made its first property acquisition late last week, only days after announcing a $50 million package to begin the buyback process.
Local mayors, a federal member of parliament, conservationists and landholders addressed the public meeting.
Farmer Ian Allen says a fighting fund has also been established.
"My farm is affected as much anyone else's," he said.
"I've spent a long time getting where I want to get, I just felt like I'm there, and this announcement of a dam has put me back where I started 20-30 years ago.
