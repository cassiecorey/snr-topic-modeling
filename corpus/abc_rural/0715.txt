Thieves target banana plantations
Soaring banana prices are making the fruit attractive to thieves at plantations near Coffs Harbour, in New South Wales.
Three thefts have been reported so far, with a shortage of fruit due to damage caused by cyclone Larry in north Queensland.
Tony Heidrich from the Banana Growers Council says it is likely to be more than a one-man operation, given the size of the stolen bunches of bananas.
"It's possibly an under-reported crime. I think there's a perception out there in the community that it's a soft crime with the perception that nobody's getting hurt as a result of a crime," he said.
