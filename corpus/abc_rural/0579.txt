Vet's braham fertility research honoured
The highest accolade in veterinary science has been awarded to a man partly responsible for the success of brahman cattle in northern Australia.
Dr Keith Entwistle has been awarded the Gilruth Prize at the Australian Veterinary Association's annual conference in Hobart this week.
He says years of research with his colleagues helped to solve problems with cow and bull fertility, when the brahman breed was first introduced.
"A lot of the research that we did over the last 30 years has certainly contributed to the wider use of the brahman," he said.
