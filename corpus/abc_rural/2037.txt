New family day care system helps outback NT families
Outback families in the Northern Territory are taking advantage of a new system of family day care.
The Federal Government lifted the cap on family day care positions earlier this year.
It has resulted in more opportunities for approved carers, and parents can claim a child care benefit.
In the Douglas Daly, south-west of Darwin, mothers like Sarah, says it is becoming easier to juggle the farm and small children.
"We do claim the CCB (Child Care Benefit), which is a fantastic help," she said.
