Bird flu diagnosis training stepped up
The CSIRO is training Department of Agriculture staff in every state and territory to improve the nation's ability to diagnose a bird flu outbreak.
An avian virologist at the agency's laboratory in Victoria, Paul Selleck, says because many Asian poultry flocks are vaccinated, symptoms are masked, making the virus difficult to detect.
In Australia though, the disease should be easier to detect, because birds aren't vaccinated.
"In chickens we see swollen heads, excessive expulsion of liquid through the mouth," he said.
"They also become depressed, and you start to see haemorrhages on the unfeathered parts of the skin such as the feet.
