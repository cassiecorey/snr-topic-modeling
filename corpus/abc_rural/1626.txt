NT farmers urged to fill out ag census forms
Northern Territory farmers have proven themselves the worst in Australia at filling out the national agricultural census.
Held every five years, the census collects data on the nation's farm production.
Forms were due back in July, but so far only 60 per cent have been returned from the Territory, compared to 80 per cent elsewhere.
Valdis Juskevics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) says the aftermath of cyclone Larry in north Queensland shows the value of the census.
"In the hours after the cyclone in March, Government phoned the ABS and asked what did we know about the farmers in far north Queensland, as in the numbers of farms, the type of farms, their production," he said.
"Within hours we turned that information around from the 2001 census and the next day, the Wednesday, the Government announced a recovery package for farmers."
