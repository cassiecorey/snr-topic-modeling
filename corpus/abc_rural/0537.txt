NLIS frustration in Tas
Tasmanian cattle producers are frustrated by the state's roll-out of the National Livestock Identification System.
They are still required to use tailtags, as well as the new electronic ear tags, even though the rest of Australia will be tail-tag free from July 1.
Tasmanian NLIS coordinator John Cameron says they need to be able to guarantee trace-back to the last property of origin before tail tags can be removed.
"At the moment there are still a lot of cattle with NLIS tags in their ears that are not registered to the correct property on the database," he said.
"So if they're sent to a saleyard or abattoir the database doesn't have the correct information about where they are.
