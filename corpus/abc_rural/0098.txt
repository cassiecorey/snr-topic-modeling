Dairy industry rallies behind FNQ producers
The Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation (QDO) has set up its own cyclone relief fund to provide help to farmers affected by cyclone Larry.
The cyclone damaged infrastructure, and power is still out in many dairies five days after it hit.
Without power farmers cannot milk and cows face the possibility of mastitis and going dry.
There has been a major effort to fly in mobile milking machines, source generators and even fly in a tanker so milk that can't be chilled can be picked up every day, otherwise it has to be poured down the drain.
QDO president Wes Judd says farmers across the country have offered their help and any donations will be most welcome.
