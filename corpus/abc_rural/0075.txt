Telstra admits 3G upgrade will not fix all black spots
Telstra has begun upgrading 5,000 mobile phone towers as it prepares to roll out a new 3G phone network early next year.
But there are growing concerns about whether mobile phone black spots will ever get network coverage, even with the 3G service.
The technology will allow mobile phone users to access fax, email and high-speed Internet services.
Telstra's Michael Patterson says mobile coverage will improve with 3G, but concedes there will be black sports, particularly in more isolated areas.
"Absolutely but at the same time all the major communities above 350 people have mobile coverage at the moment, and we're gonna be fixing some of the black spots on the highways," he said.
"We're also working with both state and federal governments to see what sort of funding is available to roll out additional base stations."
