Locusts took department "by surprise"
The director of agriculture Don Plowman says there is little his department could have done to stop the damage caused by locusts to crops grown in the Coorabie district of the far west. And he says the explosion of locust hatchings took both Primary Industries SA and local growers by by surprise. Mr Plowman was responding to criticism by grain growers in the Coorabie district who say they didn't get practical help from the department to stop the pests damaging their crops. He says the department will monitor the situation over summer and autumn.Strong gains for wool
The best price rises for wool in two years were achieved at last week's national wool sales, Elders wool manager Mark Rodda reported. He says this reflects concern by overseas buyers that Australia's drought will reduce supply and they will not be able to secure the wool they need. Mr Rodda says the best increases were in the medium to broad wools. Nineteen micron wools jumped 27cents/kilogram to finish at 953c/kg clean; 21m were up 51c to 815c/kg; 22m increased by 57c to 787c and the 23m rose 49c to 756c.
