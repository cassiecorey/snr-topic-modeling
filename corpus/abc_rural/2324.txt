Rice crop expected to drop
This year's rice crop will be one of the smallest in more than 50 years due to cuts to water allocations in southern New South Wales.
The Department of Primary Industries estimates less than 12,000 hectares of rice has been sown, only 10 per cent of average plantings.
Other industry sources say the figure is more like 15,000 hectares, which will yield around 130,000 tonnes of rice.
Griffith district rice grower Glen Andreazza says the late reduction in water allocation means he has had to abandon his rice crop.
"I had sown 80 acres of rice and had to de-water all of it," he said.
"It was to the point where all I had to do was to keep water on it and watch it grow.
