Residue concerns open up Japanese hay market
Concern over residues found in hay exported from the United States to Japan is opening up new markets for Australian farmers.
The hay exporting company Johnson Asahi wants more farmers to grow oaten hay for the Japanese market, to capitalise on Australia's clean, green image.
Spokesman Anthony Chapman says it is not yet clear what the residues found in the US hay were.
