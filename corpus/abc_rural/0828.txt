Dairy farmers warned to prepare for drop in income
There is a warning for dairy farmers today to prepare for a drop in income, as milk processing companies announce new season prices.
Fonterra has announced a 5 per cent drop in opening price compared to last season, blaming the downturn on a weaker international market and fluctuating Aussie dollar.
Industry analyst Steve Spencer believes other processors will follow suit.
"There's a lot of competition for milk in the industry and that's a pressure that's keeping prices reasonably firm," he said.
