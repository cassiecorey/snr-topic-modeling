Mental health concerns switch to young people in rural areas
The National Mental Health Initiative has raised concerns about the lack of information available about how the drought has affected young people in rural Australia.
Craig Hodges from beyondblue says the last survey was carried out in the late 1990s and data is up to 10-years-old.
He says the spin-offs from the drought are significant, with about a quarter of young people affected by depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.
"We only get this data every five to 10 years and the last one that was taken was in the late 90s which showed there was roughly one in four young women experiencing depression and one in six young men experienced depression," he said.
"They see what is happening with their parents, how parents respond to tough times on the farm and that also may mean there's less disposable income so that might mean they can't do the things they once did, so the spin-offs are quite significant."
The drought is also affecting young peoples choices at school.
At Redbank Catholic College in the west of central New South Wales, 68 students from across the state are studying agriculture in their final years.
Just a few say they will go onto work in the sector.
