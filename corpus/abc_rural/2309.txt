Eyre Peninsula farmers may have to shoot sheep
Farmers on Eyre Peninsula in South Australia may have to shoot their sheep in the next few months because they cannot afford to feed them or send them to market.
Local producer Andrew Mills says low prices being paid for sheep and lambs, combined with the high cost of transport to saleyards north of Adelaide, is forcing tough decisions.
He says the glut of sheep and lambs from interstate makes it difficult to even book sheep and lambs into abattoirs.
"In the next few months you might see quite a few sheep from Eyre Peninsula that will just have to be slaughtered and buried if the numbers keep coming out of Victoria," he said.
"It's got to the stage this week that unless they are very good sheep, you'll get a bill if you send them to Adelaide.
