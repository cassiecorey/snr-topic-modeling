Rural jobs hard to fill: survey
A joint federal and Victorian government survey suggests one third of rural employers cannot fill job vacancies.
The survey of the Wimmera Grampians region is being rolled out across the state, with the results to be compared with other states and territories.
Penny Ireland, from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, says professional and trade positions in health, finance and construction are the hardest to fill.
"There were a lot of health related professional occupations so general practitioner, registered nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists. There was also a number of trades positions, in particular motor mechanics, which we see across the country and electricians," she said.
Meanwhile, grey nomads are being used to temporarily fill some of the shortages in central Australia.
Under the Outback Links program, retired travellers are helping to fix the plumbing, or mind children on outback stations , in exchange for a taste of remote living.
Gold Coast retiree Bobbie Perkins is the first volunteer to be placed, and says helping with the housework on New Crown Station, south of Alice Springs, is actually a good way to learn about rural Australia.
