Spring brings higher demand for flowers
It is the first day of spring and today marks the beginning of the peak demand season for fresh flowers.
Victorian wild flower farmer James Frew says its the busiest time of the year as he prepares to sell to the hungry Sydney market.
He says the eastern markets are the most lucrative for flower producers.
"The market in Sydney is just, 'What have you got, what have you got? What can you send me?" he said.
