Stallholders fed up with Christmas produce
Stallholders at fresh food markets around the country could be suffering from festive fatigue.
Fruit and vegetable sellers, as well as seafood and poultry stall owners, seem to be a bit reluctant to eat their own produce this Christmas.
Here are some views from Melbourne's Queen Victoria Market.
"We've already 'mangoed' out, the kids don't want any more," one stallholder said.
"I don't really go for the turkey at Christmas lunch, I generally go for more ... lamb or beef or something," another said.
