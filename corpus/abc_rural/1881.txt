Analyst promotes forests as answer to energy supplies
An Australian analyst has dismissed the push for more ethanol and biodiesel production, saying Australia's energy future lies in wood.
Barney Foran, a visiting fellow at the Australian National University, says planting 60 million hectares of forests could provide up to 90 per cent of future transport fuels, and 20 per cent of future electricity needs .
He says many different species of wood could be used, including native trees, and this could provide another source of income for farmers in tough times.
Mr Foran says fuel processing plants should be built in regional areas.
"The key here is that we don't cart wood long distances or else we lose both the economic advantage or more importantly the energy advantage," he said.
