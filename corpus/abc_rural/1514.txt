RSPCA angry at piggery raid
An animal rights raid on a New South Wales piggery has met with anger from the RSPCA.
The piggery near Young was raided in July, where video footage of the raid was gathered.
The footage has only just been sent to police, with allegations about animal cruelty surrounding sow pens.
Chief executive of the New South Wales branch of the RSPCA, Bernie Murphy, says extremists should be stopped from entering properties.
"They go onto a property, they breach the biosecurity, they may visit great harm on the well-being of the animals plus of course they are having an impact on people's livelihoods.
"No one would tolerate someone invading someone's house and this is similar to that in a business sense.
"These people believe because they have the moral high ground in their mind, they can go onto properties, break the law, ignore it.
