Company says SA Zircon grade among best in world
Mining of zircon in the far west of South Australia is a step closer, with the discovery of what could be the world's richest grades of the mineral.
The Adelaide Resources and Iluka Resources joint venture has announced that the Tripitaka deposit north-west of Ceduna, contains about 650,000 tonnes of zircon, which is used to make ceramics, glass and aluminium.
Adelaide Resources chairman Keith Yates values the deposit at about $650 million.
"The zircon content of the heavy mineral component of Tripitaka is in the order of 65 per cent and 65 per cent by world standards is absolutely extraordinary as far as the heavy mineral component of the deposit is concerned," he said.
