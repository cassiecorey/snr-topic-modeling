Depression fears
The Grains Council of Australia says it is very concerned there will be an upsurge in depression rates as the drought tightens its grip on many states.
It estimates the country's 30,000 grain and mixed farmers will lose an average of $150,000 each on their barley and wheat crops.
Council chairman Murray Jones is urging farmers to seek help if they are not coping.
"I'm sure that this pushes a lot of people to the edge," he said.
"These are circumstances which are quite beyond their control and we're just concerned that a lot of these farm families will have some severe psychological effects on this and they need to get help if it's necessary."
