Govt considers inquiry into forest certification schemes
The Federal Forestry Minister, Eric Abetz, says a push by international green groups to reclassify the sustainable status of Australian timber poses a serious threat to exports.
He says he may set up an inquiry to investigate the disparity between classification systems used to grade old-growth logging in Indonesia, PNG and Australia.
Senator Abetz says the Government is determined to resist a push by the Mexico-based Forest Stewardship Council for Australian timber to lose its 'A' rating among some European customers.
"These groups are then bad mouthing Australia's forest products in countries like the United Kingdom and Belgium," he said.
