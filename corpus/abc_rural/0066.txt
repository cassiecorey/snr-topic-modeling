Calls to withdraw ministers' control over truck rego
The rail industry wants decisions on truck registration costs to be taken away from transport ministers, after they rejected a plan to increase charges on large vehicles.
The trucking industry says it could not afford the proposed 37 per cent increase in rego costs for B-doubles and road trains, and a 10 per cent rise in fuel taxes for heavy trucks.
But the rail industry says only 2 per cent of trucking operators will benefit.
Brian Nye from the Australasian Railway Association says there still needs to be fundamental reform of road and rail pricing.
"I'm not arguing that the trucking industry doesn't pay," he said.
"What we're saying is that smaller vehicles are cross-subsidising heavier vehicles and it's the heavier vehicles that are doing the damage.
"So, yes the trucking industry can say 'Yes we are paying a fair amount but it's the way the formula's worked out', and this was trying to redress some of that.
But the Victorian Transport Minister says the increases would have jeopardised rural businesses, already battling high transport costs.
Peter Batchelor says there needs to be a uniform approach to truck rego fees, and uncertainty over Federal Government funding for freight infrastructure also needs to be resolved.
