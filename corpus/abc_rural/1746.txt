Commercial fishermen finding it difficult to sell boats
The fishing industry is having trouble selling its commercial fishing boats, in the wake of a federal buyback of more than 400 licences around Australia.
In the major southern port of Eden in New South Wales a $2 million vessel is on the market for just $200,000.
Processor and boat owner Titch Rodahl has accepted a buyout package and has sold his boat at 1 per cent of its value.
With the buyout, it's not viable to stay open with the overheads and all that sort of stuff, it's not worth running the boats," he said.
"I sort of gave my boat away because I got paid for it in the buyout.
"Three years ago I bought the vessel for $210,000.
