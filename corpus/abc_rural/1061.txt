Hay balers fail to meet safety standards: survey
It is farm safety week and hay balers are the latest equipment to come in for some attention.
A recent survey by the Kondinin Group found two commonly-used hay balers failed to meet industry safety requirements.
Engineer Josh Guimelli says farmers should be wary when purchasing new equipment.
"A couple of the machines actually didn't have an upper walkway railing which, on a baler - large square baler - is quite a mission because they're rather high off the ground," Mr Guimelli said.
