Student conference aims to share environment knowledge
With debate about the future of drought-stressed rivers in the headlines, Canberra students have launched plans for an International Conference on River Health.
The conference, set for October next year, will bring more than 600 students from across Australia and around the world to Canberra to share knowledge about their environment.
Founder and convener Arron Wood says it is important to let our future leaders explore river issues now, so they have a head start.
"To have kids from small towns like Mildura and Renmark, and those sorts of things, talking to someone in the Amazon about the issues that they're facing," he said.
