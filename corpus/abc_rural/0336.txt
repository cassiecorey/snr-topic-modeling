S Africa begins Iraq kickback inquiry
South Africa has established its own version of the Cole inquiry, into allegations of kickbacks to the former Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein.
Eight South African companies have been subpoenaed to appear at the Donen Commission.
Public hearings will begin in two weeks and will investigate illegal oil surcharges, after-sales-service-fees and inland transportation fees paid to Iraqi officials.
Secretary of the commission, Matsepo Mobeng says the South African government has looked to Australia's example.
