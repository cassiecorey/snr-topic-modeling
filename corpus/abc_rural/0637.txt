Grain consortium hopeful of more deals with Iraq
Australian grain consortium Wheat Australia says it does not envisage any shipping problems when it begins the export of 350,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq in the next month.
Twelve weeks of negotiations concluded yesterday when Wheat Australia announced the $100 million wheat contract with Iraq had been finalised.
Spokesman Rhys Ainsworth says with one agreement reached, Wheat Australia is keen to explore further market opportunities.
"I think the good thing about the position that Wheat Australia has got to now is that we have agreed on commercially workable terms that we believe can provide Wheat Australia with a solid platform that will enable it to continue what has been a very long association with one of Australia's most critical international markets," he said.
Plum Grove commodity trader Tony Smith says the deal is good news for Australian growers but prices are still below what farmers in the United States would receive.
He estimates the deal to be worth around $190 a tonne, about $30 below expectations, but does not believe AWB could have done much better.
"At the end of the day, this deal would not have gone ahead if the AWB wasn't happy with the price," he said.
"So there's no way the AWB could've got more. You know, Wheat Australia did everything they could. There's definitely people who are going to come out and make those comments and they're just political comments, scaremongering.
