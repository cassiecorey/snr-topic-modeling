Perseverance makes $46 mill offer to Leviathan
Victoria could host Australia's second largest gold producer following a takeover offer for Leviathan Resources by Perseverance Corporation.
The bid by Perseverance is worth $46 million, valuing each Leviathan share at about 56 cents.
Perseverance intends to close Leviathan's Melbourne office and move some staff and equipment from Leviathan's Stawell Gold Mine to Perseverance's Fosterville gold mine, near Bendigo.
Managing director Graeme Sloan says if accepted, the offer will deliver big benefits to Perseverance shareholders.
"We'll have the largest landholding in Victoria, very close to 6,000 square kilometres, which is quite extraordinary given the state that the largest is Newcrest," he said.
