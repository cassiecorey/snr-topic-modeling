MLA poll rigging concerns Cattle Council
The Cattle Council has expressed concern over the involvement of peak body Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) in an Internet poll rigging scandal.
It was revealed yesterday that two employees rorted an online poll about the MLA-run National Livestock Identification Scheme (NLIS).
Council president Bill Bray is worried but he says the incident should not be taken out of context.
"There are a few silly individuals that have lost their way and done something stupid but that will be sorted out," he said.
