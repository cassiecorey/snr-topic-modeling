US ramps up beef exports to Japan
The United States Agriculture Department says beef exports worth around almost $400 million will be sold to Japan this financial year.
It is a far cry from export levels before the outbreak of mad cow disease in the US.
USDA says beef will slowly move back into the Japanese market, which has been dominated by Australia since the first US mad cow case in 2003.
Economist Monte Vandeveer estimates the US will export close to one-third of its pre-mad cow levels to Japan in fiscal 2007.
"I think we could see in the neighbourhood of maybe $400 million worth of beef exports to Japan in fiscal 2007- less than a third of what we saw in the pre-BSE period," he said.
USDA says that is still about 20 per cent of the Japanese market.
