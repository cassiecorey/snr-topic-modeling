Qld producers look to cattle from interstate
Cattle from South Australia and Victoria are being sent to Queensland because seasonal conditions have improved in the past few weeks.
Jack Gleeson from Elders in South Australia says many Queensland producers are holding onto their cattle after recent rain and the market is looking for livestock from interstate.
He says the rain has not produced more feed for livestock yet but it has changed market attitudes.
"It hasn't necessarily produced a huge body of feed in two weeks but the perception of the industry there is that their season has taken a turn for the better," he said.
