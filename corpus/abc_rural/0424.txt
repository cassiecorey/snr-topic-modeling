Dry conditions take their toll in NSW
Dry conditions are continuing to hurt in New South Wales, where producers in the Upper Hunter are being knocked back from grazing cattle on the travelling stock routes.
A lack of water is being blamed for the situation in Singleton, Scone and Merriwa, where some producers are waiting up to 12 months to access reserves.
Scone ranger Gerard McLaughlin says he does not have a choice, with half the watering points in his area dry.
"There's 590 head at the moment wandering around the roads in my area ... there could probably be a lot more if we had water that's the problem," he said.
"At the moment I'm getting more and more requests for people wanting to go on the road but it's a bit awkward when you can't access water."
