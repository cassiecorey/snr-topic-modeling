Global commodities demand to prop up farm sector
Despite drought conditions and plunging farm incomes, high global demand for commodities is expected to keep Australia's farm sector afloat in 2007, with prices up 16 per cent on the same time last year.
The Westpac Rural Commodity Index also shows rising rural land values are providing a buffer against debt and will be the main driver in post-drought recovery.
Westpac's Justin Smirk says most farmers will be able to withstand a drop in income next year.
"Over the last five years Australia's top farmers have actually been generating rates of return that match if not exceed a lot of rates of return we see in other assets around Australia," he said.
