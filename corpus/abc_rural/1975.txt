Farm hoping for canker-free future
Orchardists at Emerald in central Queensland are in the final stages of preparing for what is being called the most complex tree planting operation in Australia's history.
A total of 193,000 citrus trees had to be destroyed at 2PH farms after canker was discovered in the region in 2004.
Under a replacement project 5,000 trees will be planted every day for four months.
Manager Craig Pressler is hoping for a canker-free future.
