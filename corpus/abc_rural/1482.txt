Cane growers examine damage caused by deluge
Cane farmers in north Queensland say it is too early to know the extent of damage from massive, unexpected rain.
While September is supposed to be the driest month in the tropics, some farmers have received up to 665 millimetres in the Herbert River District around Ingham over the weekend.
That is 26 inches on the imperial scale.
While farmers further south would love even a fraction of that rainfall, plant scientist Ron Van Kerkwyk says it has halted the sugarcane harvest, and could have a disastrous impact on thousands of hectares of newly planted cane.
"Planting is the highest single operative cost you've got on a farm and it really is a tragedy of some proportions when we get as much rain as we've had here at this time of the year which, number one is fairly unusual and number two it's impacted by the fact that so much of the plant cane we have got is, relatively speaking, very young," he said.
In the south, where the rain is really needed, the dry conditions are starting to hurt South Australia's aquaculture industry.
A lack of typical winter weather means oysters are growing slower than normal, due to a lack of food.
Simon Turner from Turner Aquaculture at Cowell, on the Eyre Peninsula, says without wind or rain, fewer nutrients are being produced in the seawater to make algae, which is a major food source.
"When we have deep lows that come up from the Southern Ocean, [they] promote upwellings which also create algae and feed for our oysters and that's something that we haven't had much of at all this year," he said.
