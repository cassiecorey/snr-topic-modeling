Cyclone Monica downgraded
Darwin residents are breathing a bit easier today, with tropical Cyclone Monica downgraded to a category 1 system this morning.
Remote pearl farms too appear to have been spared major damage from the cyclone, which had been rated a destructive category five yesterday.
Chris Barnard from Arafura Pearls, north of Nhulunbuy says it is a lucky escape.
"As the winds intensified, we would have got up to about 180-200km/hr winds," he said.
"We were lucky this cyclone season in the NT. Unfortunately what I have heard from WA is that they have had a bit of a rough time. But in the NT we were saved this season. It was just a reminder to be on your toes the whole time. You never know when one might hit, even as late as it is in this season."
