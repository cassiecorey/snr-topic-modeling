Rain hits NSW cropping areas
Cropping areas in New South Wales have received their first major rainfall for the season.
Conditions took a turn for the better on the same day last year and while the rain was not as heavy this time, it was just as welcome.
Cereal cropping producers across inland New South Wales were facing another bleak season, with no rainfall during autumn across the majority of the state.
This changed on Saturday. Most inland areas received between 10 and 30 millimetres, with the majority of the cropping belt receiving around the old inch mark.
Many tractors have started up this morning, to get the winter crop in.
Subsoil moisture levels are still very low to non-existent and so crops will again be reliant on in crop rainfall.
Michael Matthews from Young says the rain does bring hope.
