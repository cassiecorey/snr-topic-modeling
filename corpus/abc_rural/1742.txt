Bunnings at centre of grapevine quarantine concerns
Giant hardware chain Bunnings could face prosecution for allegedly bringing grapevines into South Australia from a phylloxera risk area in Victoria.
Phylloxera, aphid-type insects that attack and kill grapevines, are not present in SA.
The Department of Primary Industries says 122 grapevines were found in four Adelaide Bunnings stores.
Spokesman David Cartwright says any breach of quarantine conditions could put the state's $2 billion wine industry at risk.
