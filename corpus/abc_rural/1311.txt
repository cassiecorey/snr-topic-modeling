Farmers hail success of tuna trial program
Tuna farmers are hailing the success of a trial program to catch fish all year round.
To test growth and health levels, 65 tuna have been held in cages off Port Lincoln in South Australia for the past 17 months which is four times longer than usual.
The fish were harvested yesterday and David Ellis from the Tuna Boat Owners Association says they were in excellent health.
"We're going to get the weight and the length of the fish, to see
how much they've grown," he said.
"We've also taken product quality samples or flesh samples so we're looking at how long or how red it stays for in shelf life.
