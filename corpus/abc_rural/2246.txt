Lamb slaughter levels reach 25 year high
Lamb slaughter numbers are at their highest levels in more than 25 years.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) says total sheep and lamb slaughter numbers have risen for the tenth consecutive month to more than 3.2 million.
Mutton production was also up.
Nigel Gibson from the ABS says the figures reflect the impact of the drought.
"We had 1.7 million lambs processed for the month which is around 200,000 more for the same month than the four or five previous years," he said.
"[It is a] very much higher figure than what we'd normally expect to see.
