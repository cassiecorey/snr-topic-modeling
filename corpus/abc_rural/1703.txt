Honeymoon uranium mine gets environmental green light
Final environmental approval has been granted for South Australia's controversial fourth uranium mine.
The SA branch of the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted licences for both mining and milling of uranium at the Honeymoon mine west of Broken Hill.
Concerns had been raised about potential ground water contamination from the mine's plan to extract the mineral from rock using acid.
But Keith Baldry from the EPA says the process is environmentally sound.
