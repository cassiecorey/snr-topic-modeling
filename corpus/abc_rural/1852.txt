Transporter's business booms as farmers send stock to Tas
Desperate Victorian dairy farmers are sending their stock to Tasmania.
One of Tasmania's biggest livestock carting contractors, Page Transport, is bringing up to 40 loads of cattle a week from Victoria, including some dairy cows still in milk, to be agisted on the north-west coast.
The company's operations manager, Chris Page, says it is an unfortunate consequence of the drought that his business is flat out.
"The transport industry in Tasmania will be busier through a drought, which like it or not that's our stance on it, but it is an awful thing," he said.
