Reef review recommendations disappoint fishermen
Commercial operators near the Great Barrier Reef are disappointed with a recommendation that fishing bans remain in place for another seven years.
The federal review followed industry anger at being banned from fishing a third of the reef two years ago to protect fish stocks.
The review says there should be no change to the ban, which has angered Russell Anderson from the Queensland Seafood Industry Association.
