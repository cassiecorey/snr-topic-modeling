WA takes fight to 'cane toads with wings'
Western Australia is stepping up its fight against the destructive pest bird the starling.
The State Government has allocated an extra $2 million towards reducing starling populations in the state's south.
Agriculture Minister Kim Chance says starlings are every bit as unwelcome as the cane toads threatening the north of WA.
"I think cane toads with wings is a very apt description," he said.
