Chapman Valley victorious in Powder Puff footy match
When times are tough it is even more important to have a laugh and there were plenty on hand at the annual Powder Puff footy match in WA's Chapman Valley at the weekend.
The game pits the Valley girls against the Northampton girls in front of a bid crowd of local farmers.
Abbey Langley of Northampton kicked a ripper goal on the siren and explains how it all happened.
"One of our players high tackled a Chapman Valley girl and they went to kick it and I was just in the right spot at the right time," she said.
"And I marked it. I don't know how far I was out, but I thought I wasn't going to get it.
"But I thought I'd better have a crack at it on the siren. So yeah, it was pretty funny. It's good fun."
