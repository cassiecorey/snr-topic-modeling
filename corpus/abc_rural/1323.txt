Grim outlook for SA grain harvest
A warm and windy day in South Australia yesterday has not helped what was looking set to be a decent season for grain growers.
The grain harvest will now be well below average this year, unless there is significant rain in the next two weeks.
Peter Fulwood from Rural Solutions South Australia says the state is headed for its driest winter on record.
"If we don't get substantial rain in the next couple of weeks, we could be looking at one of, if not the driest, winters on record and then we go into our spring weather where temperatures can rapidly rise in those months and we can get drying winds, crops can come under extreme moisture stress," he said.
"Overall, the state crop certainly won't be anything above average unless we were to get a complete change in the weather. The estimates we would be looking at would be below average."
Unusual weather patterns in Australia and overseas are putting new pressure on global grain prices.
Dry weather in Western Australia means grain handler CBH will not be exporting lupins this year, to ensure stock feed supplies into 2007.
