Suspension of WTO talks hampers US efforts to fight AWB
The suspension of World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks is making it harder for US farmers and trade officials to take action to try to end AWB's monopoly for exporting Australian wheat.
The last Doha round draft called for banning or phasing out single-desk monopolies, like AWB, by 2013.
But with WTO talks suspended since July, American Farm Bureau trade adviser Dave Salonsen says there is no way for the US to fight AWB.
"If they are operating according to WTO rules, as they exist now and you can't see that they're somehow not following them, there's not much opportunity, potentially, to go through a dispute settlement," Mr Salonsen said.
Australia agreed in its bilateral free trade deal with the US to address single desk trading in the WTO round.
