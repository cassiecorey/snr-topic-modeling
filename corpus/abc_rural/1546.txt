Top WA property 'Grange' changes hands
One of Western Australia's top properties has been sold for between $20 million and $30 million.
The 10,000 acre Grange, at Dongara on the west coast, dates back to 1853, and was most recently owned by the late construction giant John Roberts and his family.
Real estate agent Stephen Vaughan says there was big interest in the merino sheep stud, which was eventually sold to the Stoney family, which has extensive holdings elsewhere in the state.
"It certainly went somewhere between 20 and 30 million," he said.
"We're dealing with a property that's fairly special and in Western Australian terms it's probably up there in the top 10 per cent of general farming.
