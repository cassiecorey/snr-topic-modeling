Abattoirs given green light for halal beef exports to Malaysia
Three Australian abattoirs, one in Queensland and two in Victoria, have been given approval to send halal beef back into the Malaysian market.
Last August, Malaysia suspended beef imports from Australia due to concerns that slaughter methods do not meet Islamic standards.
The general manager of Norvic Foods, Jon Hayes, says approval was received to resume beef exports from the company's Wodonga abattoir after religious and technical auditors inspected the site.
"Malaysia is only taking a very small percentage of the Australian beef and it's another market that Australia needs," he said.
"We can't consume what we produce for 20 million people and we need the total global scene, and Malaysia is a very important market."
