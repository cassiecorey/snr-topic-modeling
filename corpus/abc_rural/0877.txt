McGauran backs livestock ID system
The Federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, has defended an audit of the National Livestock Identification System.
The Australian Beef Association (ABA) says the audit ordered by Mr McGauran in recent weeks, will not be independent, and will not solve problems inherent in the livestock traceback system.
ABA chair Linda Hewitt says there is no point checking the database is working, if the accuracy of information entered at the property and meatworks level is not checked.
Mr McGauran says the audit will be both independent and comprehensive.
"I can only say that this will be an independent assessment by the government of the day. The ABA is quite intemperate. They claim the NLIS is fundamentally flawed, not just the database," Mr McGauran said.
