Farmers' old equipment to help women in Congo
Farmers are being asked to donate old tractors and other farm machinery to help women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Civil war has cut off access to food for many people, with large numbers of women and children suffering malnutrition.
Melbourne-based appeal coordinator Polydor Mutombo says church groups will distribute the farm equipment to co-operatives of women, to grow maize, potatoes and beans.
Mr Mutombo says farming will allow the women to become self-sufficient, something money and food donations cannot achieve.
"Mostly the women are looking for food to feed their families," he said.
"They are the most affected by this war because there is killing mostly of men or men are going into the armies.
"And it's going to help them to look to other things like if they produce that food they can sell, they can pay for schooling for children.
