The ongoing impact of the drought is being assessed first hand in New South Wales by Federal Government assessors.
The National Rural Advisory Council has embarked on an extensive tour of areas coming to the end of exceptional circumstances drought relief.
Sheep specialist Doug Alcock has helped the council to understand the severity of the drought from Canberra south to the Alpine region.
"Water is the biggest issue in terms of the effort and money that's been put into infrastructure in terms of tanks and new bores and reticulation systems," he said.
"People running polypipe anything up to a couple of kilometres just to get water into paddocks, it's very expensive and heartbreaking in country that nobody has any living memory of ever going dry some of the springs."
Coastal farmers in the region are also being hit hard by drought.
