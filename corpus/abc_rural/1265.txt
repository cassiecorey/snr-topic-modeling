Biodiesel price cut unlikely
The country's biggest oil refiner says it will not be offering incentives for biodiesel to match its announcement to make ethanol cheaper at the pump.
Under a new program, Caltex and BP will offer ethanol-blended fuel at three cents per litre less than regular unleaded fuel.
Caltex government affairs manager Frank Topham says biodiesel is too expensive to cut prices for motorists.
"Biodiesel is significantly more expensive than ethanol for us to purchase, for the producers to produce and therefore a three cents a litre discount will not be possible," he said.
Caltex has also rejected claims that it is not buying fuel from the county's biggest biofuels producer.
