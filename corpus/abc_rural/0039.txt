Wool market expected to continue gaining ground
The wool industry is closely watching how China reacts to climbing wool prices with the season's biggest sales this week.
More than 82,000 bales are on offer in the wake of strong global interest which has pushed prices to a season high of 746 cents a kilo clean.
But Maurie McNeill from Elders Wool says despite some concern among buyers, the market should continue to gain ground.
"We've got the largest offering of the season coming up this week, so obviously yes we are cautious and we're seeing quite a bit of Chinese resistance at these levels," he said.
