Govt unable to contain sugar cane smut disease
The Queensland Government has conceded that it is unable to contain the devastating disease, sugar cane smut.
It was confirmed late yesterday that smut has reached the Mackay area after it was first found near Bundaberg in June.
The industry has now turned its focus to limiting the economic impact on the billion dollar sector.
Eion Wallace, from the industry's research and development arm, BSES, says smut may have been in Mackay for some time.
"The evidence at the moment would suggest that it's an incursion that occurred certainly before harvest and probably before this season, probably," he said.
"Which means that it is not a failure of containment from Bundaberg and Childers but a separate incursion either at the same time as Bundaberg and Childers, or subsequent to it."
South of the border, the sugar industry has launched a new round of crop surveillance.
Rick Beattie, from the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-operative, believes the disease may have been spreading for at least a year but not been detected.
He is asking farmers to check crops, so the disease can be detected early if it is there.
