Drastic drop in cotton planting expected
The Australian cotton season has begun in central Queensland, although only a quarter of the normal area is expected to be planted.
A small band of farmers have started planting crops, relying on unused irrigation water from last season, since there is no new water available this season because of the drought.
Grower Hamish Miller says he is hoping for better prices, because of the lower crop estimate.
"I could sit here for hours and talk about the price but I think fundamentally from information that I work with and receive I think the market does look like it will move higher in the short to medium term," he said.
