Newton named produce Ombudsman
A new Ombudsman has been appointed to regulate disputes between fruit and vegetable producers and buyers.
It follows the release of two reports questioning the merits of a voluntary code of conduct for the industry.
The Federal Government has appointed David Newton from the Sydney-based Accord group as the Produce and Grocery Ombudsman.
Growers want a mandatory code of conduct to help them negotiate with supermarkets and wholesalers but the Federal Government seems to be leaning towards a voluntary code.
Mr Newton says there is nothing wrong with a voluntary code.
"I think there are pluses and minuses in each one, but I wouldn't say that just because a mandatory code is in place that that is going to provide 100 per cent improvement over voluntary," he said.
