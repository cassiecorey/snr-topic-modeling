Native flower exports wilt
Australia's native flower sector expects to lose about 30 per cent of its export flower crop this year.
Drought, frosts and hot weather have decimated crops, with some growers reporting bud losses of 50 per cent and hundreds of thousands of flowers which are unsaleable.
Tony Kosky from the Australian Flower Export Council says lower production levels will affect Australia's international reputation as a reliable flower supplier.
