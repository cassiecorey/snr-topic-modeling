Chinese uranium deal could prompt new mining boom
Australia could be set for a new mining boom with China set to sign an agreement to explore for uranium.
China is also a step closer to buying more uranium from Australia, to feed its new breed of nuclear power plants.
Mining analyst Warren Edney, from ABN Amro, expects Chinese companies to seek joint ventures rather than stake their own claims.
"They will be able to contract sales to the Chinese nuclear power generators and potentially we may even see BHP's Olympic Dam selling to the Chinese," Mr Edney said.
"I don't think that we will see massive exports because there is not necessarily a lot of free uranium which is why the price has gone up for yellow cake.
