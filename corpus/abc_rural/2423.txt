Early grain harvest sees farmers enjoy pre-Christmas activities
Victorian grain farmers are being roped into Christmas preparations by their families, with harvest finishing early.
Usually most croppers are stripping paddocks right up to and after Christmas day, but the drought has had a drastic impact on yields.
Grain growers say the extra time this year is a mixed blessing.
"I actually didn't sow a crop this year, so maybe I'll have an early Christmas, a nice early Christmas," one grower said.
"Had a bit more Christmas shopping time, so it's good to get that done instead of at the last minute," another said.
