Barrick up-beat about gold price rise
The price of gold has slipped yet again overnight, but the world's biggest gold miner remains confident about the long-term market.
Barrick Gold Corporation is standing by its prediction of a gold price of $US700 an ounce by the end of the year.
That is a fair way above the current price of $US566.
But chief executive Greg Wilkins says not enough gold is being produced globally to replace current reserves, which should drive the price back up.
"Clearly one of the challenges for the industry and for the viability is trying to manage the cost," he said.
"If gold prices come back down below $500 an ounce it won't take all that long for the supply side to shrink more rapidly than we're seeing today which in turn I think would have positive impact and bring the price back up.
