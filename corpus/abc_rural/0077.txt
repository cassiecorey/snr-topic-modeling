Predicted egg shortage to increase prices
There are predictions of a looming national shortage of eggs, despite an oversupply and all-time low prices over the past six months.
Those two factors, coupled with a hot summer, have led to birds being culled in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.
Steven Todd from Southern Eggs says fewer birds means fewer eggs with prices set to rise by 20 per cent.
He says the bigger players are the ones who will benefit.
