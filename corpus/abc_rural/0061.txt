NZ Govt accused of ignoring farmers
Wool prices are down, it is hard for dairy farmers to break even, and the government is interfering - it might sound familiar, but those concerns are coming out of New Zealand, not Australia.
New Zealand's Reserve Bank has cut its national growth forecast, citing a seven-year low in farm incomes.
And while farm businesses across the ditch contribute to 15 per cent of the economy, farmers say they are being ignored by government.
Don Nicolson, from the Federated Farmers of New Zealand, says the Government is over taxing and interfering, and it is hard to make a buck.
"You would wonder whether they take notice of us," he said.
"We have been continually telling them the same thing for many years: we don't need government assistance in our lives.
"We just need the framework to operate our business to be as free and as friendly as we can have it.
