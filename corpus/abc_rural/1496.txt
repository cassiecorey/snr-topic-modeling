Competition policy 'hurting rural communities'
A new report says Australia's push to become internationally competitive has hurt the economic well-being of country communities.
Research think-tank, the Australian Farm Institute, says National Competition Policy has affected essential services and infrastructure development in country towns.
Executive director Mick Keogh says a lack of decision-making at the regional level, and confusion over state and federal policy, is not helping.
"Sometimes regional policy development seems to be aimed at increasing the population in rural centres, sometimes it seems to be aimed at bringing new industries into regional areas, sometimes it seems to be aimed at easing congestion in capital cities," he said.
"So, I think a lot of confusion exists and a lot of government packages that are called regional development packages don't seem to have a clear objective."
Federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Warren Truss, says the Government is committed to ensuring country towns have a full range of services.
But he says the Government expects regional communities to identify what they need themselves and then come forward with those projects.
