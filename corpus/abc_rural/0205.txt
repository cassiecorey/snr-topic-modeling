Blue gum woodchip shipment set for Japan
The first shipment of plantation blue gum woodchips from western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia is being loaded at Portland.
The 21,000 tonne load will head for pulp and paper mills in Japan tomorrow and eventually half a million tonnes will be sourced locally each year.
Nick Kingsford from Mitsui Afforestation Limited says this first load is a significant milestone for the industry.
"It's the first commercial shipment and there's a significant resource out there and from here exports are just going to continue to grow," he said.
