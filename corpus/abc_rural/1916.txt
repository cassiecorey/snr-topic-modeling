PM to hear farmers' drought concerns
Farmers will put their concerns about the Federal Government's drought assistance package to the Prime Minister today.
John Howard has started a two day tour of drought hit regions in New South Wales, as dryland farmers call for grants to re-sow their crops when the drought breaks.
Mr Howard says now that the Federal Government has committed a total of $2.1 billion in drought assistance, it is time for the states to do their part in the form of water rates relief.
Mr Howard is particularly critical of the NSW Government because he says some of the Federal Government's drought assistance is going straight into their coffers for water charges.
