International College aims to reduce skills shortage
Farmers in Victoria's Sunraysia region are hoping that an influx of overseas students will help to solve the region's skills shortage.
When it opens next month, the Mildura International College will provide horticulture training to 100 students from different countries, with a mixture of classroom and on-farm experience.
Campus manager Bruce Hunter says there is already plenty of support from district farmers.
"We've had people quite interested in having students to learn the profession," he said.
