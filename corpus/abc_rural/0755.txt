Cold snap takes toll on prawn operator
The cold weather snap in the far north of Western Australia has taken its toll on one aquaculture venture.
Six hundred and sixty thousand prawn fingerlings are feared dead after the spate of cold weather, including overnight lows of eight degrees.
The marine prawns stop feeding at 20 degrees and die at 13 degrees, and owner Ian Crimp says there is not much movement in the tank.
"The water monitor shows the temperature is down to 14.5 at the present time and it's getting pretty low and will be probably devastating for the prawns," he said.
"These little ones might be in the great prawn house in the sky by now. Prawn heaven!"
The rising cost of fuel is also threatening the seasonal harvest of banana prawns.
Some trawlers caught up to 10 tonnes more when authorities extended the season by a fortnight.
But fisherman Ean Casey says the good catches were not enough to cover fuel, competition from cheaper imported prawns, and labour shortages.
"It's been was a worse year than previous years even though we caught more," he said.
"This year we found it very hard to get people. We will probably look at bringing in overseas labour (from Indonesia).
