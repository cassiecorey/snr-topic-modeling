Wheat export issue divides growers
Wheat growers across Australia are divided on whether Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran should allow AWB's rivals to export wheat.
Mr McGauran now holds the wheat export veto and is considering 44 bids to export wheat to 20 countries after calling on traders to submit their applications.
Farmers disagree on what Mr McGauran should do, but believe opening the market would be the end of the single desk.
"It's too detrimental for the whole grains industry to allow those to take place, it would effectively destroy the single desk as we know it," one farmer said.
"As far as we're concerned as growers, the single desk has run its day.
"To think that you are just going to chuck all that out in one year I think is extremely dangerous, we need to have this debate first and then decide how our wheat is going to be handled."
