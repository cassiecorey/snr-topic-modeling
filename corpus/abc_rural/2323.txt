US committee chief to let Senate decide on AWB probe
The new chairman of the US House Agriculture Committee says he will leave it up to the US Senate to probe the AWB scandal, but will look at ways to prevent problems in the future.
Collin Petersen says he is not interested in "assigning blame" based on "past history", but in dealing with the monopoly practices of the AWB and the Canadian Wheat Board for the future: "We're not happy about the Australian Wheat Board, we think that having this kind of a system is not fair and not right, and we've been trying to get rid of it for a long time, some of us," he said.
"So we will be watching to see how this is reconstituted and whether it is going to be done in a way that is transparent, or whether it's going to be utilised to undercut us when we're trying to go into other markets."
Mr Petersen expects the Senate, under new democratic leadership, to look at why the just-ended Republican Congress dropped any plans to probe the oil for food scandal.
Meanwhile wheat exporter AWB has dropped prices for the 2006/07 national pool by $8 a tonne.
The company blames a weaker international market for the decline, with the benchmark premium white wheat now returning $242 a tonne.
