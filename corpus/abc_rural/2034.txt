Funding shortage kills weed research centre
The Co-operative Research Centre for Weeds will close by 2008, after failing to win further Federal Government funding.
The national research and development body had sought an additional $30 million funding over seven years, but failed to meet three out of the four necessary criteria.
Chief executive Rachel Mcfadyen says it is a disastrous result because climate change will bring on fresh weed invasions.
"Some of the northern weeds will move south, as the temperature heats up so in particular for example prickly acacia, mesquite in the grazing lands will extend their range southwards to western New South Wales and possibly even in Western Australia," she said.
"Things like lantana along the coast will extend its range southward and we do offer advice as to how best manage those weeds and how to limit their spread."
