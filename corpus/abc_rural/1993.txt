Fruit canning company offers drought help to farmers
Australia's biggest fruit canning company is offering extra drought assistance to growers to shore up supplies for the summer.
SPC Ardmona is offering suppliers in Victoria's Goulburn Valley a $1.7 million package.
Managing director Nigel Garrard says the package includes loans, access to water and extra payments for fruit.
"It's three prongs to it, firstly, is interest free loans to enable them to buy water because we recognise a number of them need some help with the funding of the water," he said.
"Secondly, are subsidies on fruit delivered to us and that'll be for fruit and tomatoes.
