More wool processing goes offshore
The shipment of the Australian wool processing industry to Asia continues to gather pace.
Elders has announced it will start fitting out its new Chinese factory with equipment from its former Geelong plant in the next few weeks.
However, the company still has not made a decision on what it will do with equipment from its Parkes plant, in New South Wales.
Will McEwin, the general manager for Elders in China, says the former Geelong plant should be in full operation by early next year.
"It will be effectively what Geelong was, which was scouring as well as combing, right the way through to top and then we also have a link into the larger Nanchang group which is our partner in China and they go right the way through to suit making," he said.
