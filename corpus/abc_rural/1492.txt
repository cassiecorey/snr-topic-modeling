Dry conditions threaten cereal crops
Ongoing dry conditions are starting to take their toll on winter cereal crops in New South Wales.
In the state's north-west farmers are already reporting failed crops, and are turning sheep and cattle into the paddocks to salvage what is left after the dry winter.
Ed Colless from the Special One Farmers Cooperative at Walgett, says crops planted on minimal moisture are starting to wither, and without substantial rain, many more will end as stock feed soon.
