Grain growers urged not to accept low shares offer
The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) is warning grain growers not to accept low offers for their shares in wheat exporter AWB.
The Australian Share Purchasing Corporation is offering drought-hit farmers $1.50 for their B class shares.
Ian Hastings from the VFF is worried that growers do not realise their shares are worth almost twice that amount.
