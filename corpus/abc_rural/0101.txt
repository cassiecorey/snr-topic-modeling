Farmers sign up to save rare cocky
Farmers are signing up in droves for a project which offers them cash for preserving the habitat of the Commonwealth Games mascot.
The Federal Government will spend more than $1 million to try to save the last 1,000 red tailed black cockatoos, found in Victoria and South Australia.
Cockies have been seen on the farm of Richard Hobbs at Clear Lake, who says protecting trees serves a dual purpose.
"We do value the trees, we think that we can crop and have trees," he said.
"We think it increases production - protection for the livestock and probably for crops too.
