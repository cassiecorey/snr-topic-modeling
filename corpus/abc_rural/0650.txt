Labor targets regional Coalition voters
The Federal Opposition has moved to capitalise on the turmoil within the Nationals, launching a drive to win over disaffected Coalition voters in regional Australia.
Labor leader Kim Beazley met with the National Farmers Federation (NFF) last night.
He says he wants to open a new dialogue directly with regional Australia.
Mr Beazley says Labor and farmers have plenty in common, despite Labor's opposition to the Workchoices policy and importing foreign workers, which are both supported by the NFF.
Mr Beazley says the party will win seats in regional Australia at the next election based on what he says is a cumulative affect of issues like the sell-off of Telstra, Australia's trade performance and the now defunct Nationals merger.
"After a while everyone wakes up and this is what's happening now," he said.
Mr Beazley says regional development spokesman Simon Crean and disendorsed Opposition agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor will lead the regional policy push.
