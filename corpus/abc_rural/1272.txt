Aust firefighters help battle US blazes
A team of 47 Australian and New Zealand firefighters have flown to the United States to help battle some of the worst summer wildfires in more than a decade.
The crew is on a four-week deployment in the western part of the US, where more than 40 fires are burning.
Jeff Pike from Victoria's Department of Sustainability and Environment says Australian firefighters will have to work in unfamiliar conditions.
"Most of their fuel is soft wood fuel systems, pine spruces and fuel like that," he said.
"The elevations they operate at are a little higher than here.
