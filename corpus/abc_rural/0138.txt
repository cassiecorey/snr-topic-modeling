Tough times for SA potato farmers
South Australian potato growers are facing a poor harvest, with below average yields and low prices.
Growers say there's been an oversupply of potatoes for the past three season, and there's no relief in sight.
Greg Rodert who grows potatoes for the fresh market in Bordertown, says the below cost of production prices have forced many growers to cut back on the amount they produce.
'We're down in our plantings generally through lack of finance I suppose you might say," Mr Rodert said.
