Locust fears prompt chemicals buy-up
Following warnings Western Australia is facing a huge locust plague this spring, the State Government has allocated more than $3 million towards the purchase of chemicals to control plagues.
Minister for Agriculture Kim Chance says if untreated, locusts could cost the state more than $100 million.
It is thought big summer rains have contributed to heavy egg laying this year.
Mr Chance says farmers have to prepare for major damage.
"It's not, in terms of area, quite as big as the spring 2000 infestation was, which covered about, looks to me on the map, two to three times the areas," he said.
