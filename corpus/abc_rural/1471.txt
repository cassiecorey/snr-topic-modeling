Dubbo merino ram sales prices down
The tough conditions have been reflected at one of the nation's top merino ram sales, which has recorded lower average prices than last year.
The annual sale at Dubbo in central western New South Wales attracted hundreds of wool growers from across the country hoping to pick up a bargain.
The top price paid was just $18,000 for a local Roseville Park Stud ram, compared to last year's high of $43,000.
Dave Hart, from Landmark, says some breeders made the most of the keen competition.
"There was a bit of pessimism around in the shed leading up to the sale," he said.
"I think it was a great value for money sale for stud and commercial growers, that will tend to happen, they are the rams that the smarter commercial growers will come here and pick up.
