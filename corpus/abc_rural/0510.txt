Fly slows weed threat in Timor
A natural predator is slowing the spread of the world's worst weed across our northern neighbours.
The stem galling fly has been introduced across East and West Timor, to control siam weed.
Researcher Rob Williams says the Australian-funded project also reduces the chance of the weed gaining a foothold in the Northern Territory.
"Siam weed can be seen in 90 per cent of the countryside in East Timor, and it covers the grasslands," he said.
The (stem) gall flies are re-producing here. They released 200 gall flies here last year. The gall flies survived through the dry season and are growing here now.
