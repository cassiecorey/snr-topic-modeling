Bushfires damage NT mango crops
Bushfires have damaged almost ripe mangoes on up to 10 orchards near Darwin, in the Northern Territory.
More than 50 volunteers have been battling the fires across 30 square kilometres in the Darwin River area, south of the territory capital.
With the mango harvest only a few weeks away, senior fire control officer Andrew Turner says the property loss could have been prevented.
"Fire has covered about 110 blocks to date, many of them haven't had any sort of fire planning put in place at all," he said.
"With the grasses, they really need to be managed and many of the land holders out there aren't managing sufficiently.
"Hopefully this event and the coverage that it has got will encourage people to do the right thing and ensure they have a good and solid plan.
"Certainly there is slashing and mowing that can certainly carry on."
