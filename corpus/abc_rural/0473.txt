Punters
What do the punters think of the Budget?
"For me, I'm in a retirement age so the amount that I can earn tax-free has gone up, the threshold there, so I think the threshold for low-income earners has been very good," one person said.
"It's quite encouraging about the water, that's going to be the biggest problem and I think people in the towns have got to realise that they've got to pay more for their water and not be so greedy and they've got to do something about storage," another said.
"I think the Budget lacks vision because it should have looked at the longer term infrastructure issues and I just think that politicians are driven by short term decision making all the time which we pay a big price for," a third person said.
