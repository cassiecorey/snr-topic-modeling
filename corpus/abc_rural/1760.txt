Funding cuts
The cutting of funding to rural financial counselling services across Australia has come in for some strong criticism from a mental health body.
State and federal governments have been arguing over the funding, with some states threatening service cuts unless the Federal Government provides more money.
Professor Brian Kelly, from the NSW Centre for Rural And Remote Mental Health, says financial counsellors are irreplaceable during the drought.
"They're the people who are often consulted by farmers about managing the business, managing the pressures they face in farming," he said.
