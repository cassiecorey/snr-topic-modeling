Senate committee calls for national water register
A Senate committee is calling on the federal and state governments to better deal with Australia's water problems by establishing a national water entitlements register.
The Rural and Regional Affairs Committee's water inquiry report also recommends the Federal Government should build a sewage recycling plant to educate the public and help farmers switch from crops that use large amounts of water.
Committee chairman Senator Bill Heffernan says better accounting of current water stocks is needed to help planning.
"We need to put onto a database what water we've got," he said.
"In the Murray Darling Basin, we've identified 3,000 gigalitres that's going to disappear out of the system due to climate change, fires, forest interception.
