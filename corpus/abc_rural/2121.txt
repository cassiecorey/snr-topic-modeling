Abetz secures agreement for coordinated fishing patrols
The Federal Fisheries Minister says he is confident that Australia and Indonesia can work together to crack down on illegal fishing in our northern waters.
Senator Eric Abetz met with the Indonesian Fisheries Minister yesterday and has secured an agreement for coordinated patrols along fishing zone boundaries.
He says Australia does need to be self sufficient in the fight against illegal fishing but says support from Indonesia will help.
"The Indonesian Minister was very supportive of the concept of coordinated patrols which would see the Indonesian navy patrolling on its side of the border," he said.
