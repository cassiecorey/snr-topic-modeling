Grain president resigns after single desk comments
Wrangling over the single desk's future in the nation's largest grain growing state has claimed a scalp.
Earlier this week, the Western Australian Farmers Federation's grain president, Ray Marshall, released a new and alternative policy position, urging the single desk be maintained.
But, at least for this season, he urged that the power of veto be removed from AWB and transferred to the Wheat Export Authority.
The statement has divided group members.
