First independent sugar shipment leaves Cairns
The first shipment of sugar from two Queensland mills operating outside the industry's single desk has left Cairns bound for China.
Queensland Sugar Limited's monopoly on export sales has ended under deregulation, with the Mossman and Mulgrave mills deciding to join the trade.
Worker Barry Donnelly was at the Cairns sugar terminal to watch the 24,000 tonnes of sugar being loaded.
"This will take about 17 hours to load this ship - there are five holds on this ship and they will just about be filled to capacity," he said.
