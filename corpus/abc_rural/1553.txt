Beef industry worried at US 'grain-fed' labelling plans
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is worried at US plans to allow beef from cattle that have spent time in feedlots and eaten grain, to be labelled "grass-fed".
MLA regional manager Michelle Gorman says Australia prides itself on being a leader in grass-fed beef.
Ms Gorman says USDA must remember the consumer when it rewrites the rules on grass-fed labelling.
"There are people that are interested in how the animal has been raised ... and we have many other product categories here, whether it's natural, organic, grain-fed," she said.
"It's just another product in the range and there needs to be some accuracy in the type, how the product was and then, how it's labelled."
Ms Gorman says sales of Australian beef cuts in North America are growing month on month, and the grass-fed label is working.
