Tassie farmer recognised by vege industry
A Tasmanian potato farmer has been named the Young Vegetable Grower of the Year, for his leadership during the Fair Dinkum Food campaign.
Matthew Ryan from northern Tasmania was honoured at the national conference of AusVeg in Brisbane at the weekend.
He says the campaign raised the profile of the vegetable industry, but there is still more to be done.
