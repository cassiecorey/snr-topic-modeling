Vaile
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile says the Government will not allow Australian wheat exports to compete against each other in overseas markets.
The Government will decide which companies are allowed to export wheat for the next six months, but AWB will not have to apply for an export permit.
Mr Vaile wants the Government to gauge the views of grain grower organisations and wheat farmers before any decisions are made on the future of the export system.
"We initially need to have a discussion with those groups to draw together the points of view to probably develop an options paper going forward, then that needs to be broadly discussed across the industry," he said.
"I think that at a point in this process the best thing that we can do as a Government is communicate directly with growers."
