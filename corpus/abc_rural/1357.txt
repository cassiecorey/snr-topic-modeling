Dingo preservation plan angers pastoralists
South Australian authorities want to protect the pure-bred dingo in the state's far north, but pastoralists are not happy with the move.
The Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation says some dingo populations in the Simpson Desert should be protected to stop inter-breeding with wild dogs.
But Rodney Fullerton, from Mungeranie Station on the Birdsville Track, says it is unrealistic and impossible to get a balance between conservation and control.
"What happens out there in the desert, in the good seasons there's a lot of dogs out there and they breed up out there," he said.
"Once it gets dry out there in the desert, they come in on these pastoral properties.
"They come in and they play havoc with our calves and they kill them pretty quick because they're hungry.
