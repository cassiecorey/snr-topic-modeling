AWB releases grain stock onto domestic market
With many grain crops failing around the country, AWB International has started to release large stocks of grain onto the domestic market.
The feedlot and milling industry have been bidding strongly for the grain, with wheat futures on the Stock Exchange hitting more than $300 a tonne this week.
The chairman of AWB International, Ian Donges, says the company will also open up a number of silos for producers to buy grain for their livestock.
Mr Donges says AWB still has large supplies of wheat.
"The budget has been around four to 5 million tonnes," he said.
"We have got to realise that wheat of course is spread across Australia.
