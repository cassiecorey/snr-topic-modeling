Iraq wheat deal collapses
A deal to sell 350,000 tonnes of Australian wheat to Iraq is off.
The sale was brokered by the consortium Wheat Australia after Iraq announced it would no longer do business with AWB.
The consortium involving ABB, Graincorp and CBH is blaming increased demands from the Iraqi Grains Board although it will not specify what they were.
It has rejected suggestions its inexperience in Iraq was a factor or because the wheat came from AWB's national pool.
Spokesman Rhys Ainsworth says the sale was not in the best interests of wheat growers.
"There were a couple of commercial issues that Wheat Australia, given that Wheat Australia are negotiating on behalf of Australian wheat growers, weren't able to agree to and unfortunately we weren't able to broker a deal over the last eight to 10 weeks despite what have been very positive discussions," he said.
"We're disappointed for Australian wheat growers.
"Wheat Australia came together following the efforts of the Government to secure this opportunity.
"Certainly several of the areas that we weren't able to reach agreement on weren't what you'd call common I suppose."
AWB, which has veto rights over export deals, says it will reconsider whether other companies can tackle the Iraq market.
