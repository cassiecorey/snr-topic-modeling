Mining expansion may affect water resources
The coal industry has conceded that water resources may be damaged by rapid expansion of underground mining in New South Wales.
Spending on coal exploration in New South Wales has increased by 50 per cent in the last year and many new mines are set to open in the Hunter Valley and the state's north west.
Chris Moran, from the Sustainable Minerals Institute at Queensland University, says the scientific understanding of underground aquifers and the technology needed to mine around them still haven not been developed.
"The question here is whether we have done the technical engineering research early enough to have effectively worked out the cracking, the surface slumping and started to look at underground techniques that will allow either the cracks to be sealed up or the cracking to be minimised during the process of mining," he said.
