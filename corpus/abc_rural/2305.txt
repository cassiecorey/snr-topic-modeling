Senate committee members reject petrol inquiry report
Members of a Senate committee investigating petrol prices have rejected the inquiry's final report, prepared by Liberal Senator George Brandis.
The report concludes market fluctuations save motorists money, further regulation would cost them more and the Federal Government cannot influence the higher prices paid in rural areas.
Deputy chairwoman of the Senate Economics Committee Labor Senator Ursula Stephens says the report's conclusions are unacceptable.
"There was great disappointment by the recommendations which really supported the status quo and found there was nothing that could be done that could alleviate higher petrol prices for country people," she said.
