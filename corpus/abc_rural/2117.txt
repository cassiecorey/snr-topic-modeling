Harvester safety reviewed
Several hundred harvesters in New South Wales might have to be fitted with a safety device after the settlement of a high profile court case.
WorkCover is withdrawing its prosecution of machinery manufacturer CNH Australia and a New South Wales dealer over a 2003 farm accident, where a worker lost his leg while trying to clear a blockage in a combine harvester.
CNH Australia's Stuart Redman says the company has agreed to design, test and fit a device to make the particular model of header safer.
"It's probably going to be like an interlock device on the ladder accessing the top of the combine and once the farmer pulls down the ladder then it will cut off the machine. It's still very much in design and test phase at this stage but that's what we will be looking at," Mr Redman said.
The agreement only applies to the case IH 2388 header in use in New South Wales.
