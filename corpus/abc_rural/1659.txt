British company to takeover Perth oil exploration company
Perth-based oil exploration company Hardman Resources has agreed to a takeover by British-based Tullow Oil.
Tullow Oil is offering just over $2 a share for the company, which is known for its offshore oil projects in developing countries.
Stock analyst Peter Strackensays says the offer has had a positive impact on Australian oil exploration stocks across the board.
"We've seen quite a few stocks bounce on that - Roc Oil, who shares interest in Mauritania with Hardman and Woodside and has other interests in China and other parts of West Africa," he said.
