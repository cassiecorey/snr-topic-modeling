Govt calls for Q fever vaccine tenders
The Federal Government has called for tenders to produce Q fever vaccine as supplies of the drug reach critically low levels.
Q fever is a debilitating disease which mainly affects meat and livestock workers, and is transmitted through infected animals.
Though the tender process should be completed by next month, the Government says it is unlikely a new supplier will be found in time to prevent a vaccine shortage.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has criticised CSL for ending production and bulldozing the vaccine plant.
"The Government has called for expressions of interest for a tender to produce long term supplies of Q [fever] vaccine, it may well be that CSL will be a tenderer but there may be other companies as well," he said.
