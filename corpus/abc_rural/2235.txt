Scientists focus on shellfish to help research climate change
New scientific research is focusing on shellfish in an attempt to unlock the affect of humans on the climate.
A PhD student at the Australian National University is using oysters and mussels from Tasmania, Queensland and New South Wales to track changes in salinity and temperature.
Sarah Tynan says scientists around the world are starting to do similar work.
"I'm hoping to add to the overall picture of climate change," she said.
