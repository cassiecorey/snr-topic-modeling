AWB accused of reneging on wheat commitment
Grain traders are accusing AWB of reneging on a public commitment to relax the company's power of veto over wheat exports.
They say applications for hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat, including one from the consortium Wheat Australia, are held up at the Wheat Export Authority (WEA).
It is nearly a month since Trade Minister Mark Vaile told grain growers that AWB would relax its veto power to allow other companies to export to Iraq.
But applications to export more than half a million tonnes of wheat have been before the WEA for weeks, including a Wheat Australia bid to sell 350,000 tonnes to Iraq.
Under current legislation, AWB must give written authority to the WEA before any export applications can be processed.
"The authority must not give a bulk export consent without the prior approval in writing of AWB. I guess they're still waiting for that," Alick Osborne from the Grain Exporters Association said.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran is confident AWB will stand by its word.
"AWB has committed to the Government and to wheat growers to waive its veto power, they will honour that commitment," he said.
