Drought may force return of livestock
Farmers in south-west Victoria who have been "parking" dairy cows from drought areas, say they may soon have to send them back.
The big dry is now spreading to high rainfall areas forcing farmers to begin hand feeding.
They are also worried that drinking water will run out before the end of summer.
Bernard Baxter from Simpson says farmers will have little choice but to send livestock home.
"I think that will come to a grinding halt," he said.
"It's going to be life support mode at the moment and everybody for themselves to basically reassess the situation because only about a month, six weeks ago we still could have had the best year ever possible if the rains had of continued because it has turned for potentially the worst for our area here.
