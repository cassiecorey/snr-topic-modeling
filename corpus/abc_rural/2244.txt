Dalby stock horse sale fetches record prices
Records have been broken at Australia's biggest stock horse sale in southern Queensland.
New records were set for all categories at the annual Dalby sale with the highest price of $70,000 paid for a mare by well-known sire Warrenbri Romeo.
That was $5,000 higher than last year's record price and livestock agent Mick Cuskelly says the sale made nearly $2 million altogether.
"We're a little bit back in numbers which you always get in these tough seasons and we had quite a few withdrawals before the sale, a few people couldn't make it, couldn't get away form their properties with the drought in the country," he said.
