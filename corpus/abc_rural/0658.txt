Teens urged to consider joining cattle industry
More teenagers are being encouraged to consider joining the cattle industry as part of a partnership between a public high school and a cattle station.
The Northern Territory's Coodardie Brahman Stud supplies weaner steers to Taminmin High School on Darwin's outskirts.
The bush steers are broken to halter and presented for show and sale by the students.
Stud director Moira O'brien says it helps to give them a better understanding about the production and marketing cycle of the cattle industry.
"We really enjoy helping them out and working in their program, and I think it's really important for that industry community, collaboration, and anywhere where we can encourage young people and teach city people about agricultural life and cattle station workings and the industry, I think is really, really important," she said.
