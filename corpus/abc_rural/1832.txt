Collinsville mine waiting for final green light
After 10 years of exploration in the Collinsville area and 18 months of preliminary development, Q Coal Pty Ltd is expecting to start serious construction early next year. Situated in the Charters Towers mining district, the open cut mine is six kilometres south of Collinsville. Managing director Christopher Wallin says the final deadline for community objection to the project is November 8 and they have applied for three, 30 year leases to support the open cut mine.
"We believe that there'll be over 100 jobs full time and during construction of course there'll be several hundred jobs in the construction phase."
