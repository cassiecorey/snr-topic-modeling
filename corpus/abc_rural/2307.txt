Saleyards used to protect shelter stock
As bushfires continue to burn in Victoria, local saleyards are being used to shelter livestock.
Wangaratta saleyards in the north-east will be open 24 hours a day to accept cattle and sheep in emergencies.
Water and shelter will be available but the chief executive of Wangaratta Council, Doug Sharp, says feed also needs to be provided.
"We can hold them indefinitely but it's the situation regarding feed that is the issue," he said.
