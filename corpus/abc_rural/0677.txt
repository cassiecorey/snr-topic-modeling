Indonesian fishermen jailed for poaching sea cucumbers
Eleven Indonesian fishermen have been jailed after being caught poaching the sea cucumber, trepang, in Australian waters north of Broome in Western Australia last month.
They were on board two boats intercepted by the Navy at Scott Reef.
One of the captains has been sentenced to seven months jail, while the other captain and nine crew members have been fined.
They will spend between three and six months in jail because they could not pay the penalties.
