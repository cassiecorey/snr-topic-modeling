Ethics campaigners push for teminator gene ban
Gene ethics campaigners are lobbying the Federal Government to ban the development of terminator technology in Australia.
The process would stop seed from breeding naturally, forcing farmers to buy new stocks each year instead of growing their own.
More than 10,000 people have signed a petition claiming genetic engineering companies will have monopoly power if the technology is introduced.
The Government has said it will accept development applications on a case-by-case basis.
However, Bob Phelps from the GeneEthics Network says that is not acceptable.
"There's clearly strong public sentiment that the terminator is not acceptable," he said.
"We're submitting those petitions to the federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran and we're saying to the Australian Government we want you to align the Australian Government policy with the global view that it's unacceptable and that the global ban on terminator should remain."
