Bee industry insiders blamed for expensive 'sting'
Bee thieves in Tasmania are making off with thousands of insects, stealing hives and threatening livelihoods.
This year a series of thefts has cost Tasmanian beekeepers an estimated $100,000.
Mole Creek beekeeper Shirley Stephens has lost hives in the latest 'sting' and says she suspects insiders are at work.
"A hive at the moment, if you take it to pollination, is worth anything from 80 to $100 per hive, but I'm afraid it must be from within our own industry that this is happening because John Smith or Joe Blow wouldn't dream of going near a bee hive," she said.
