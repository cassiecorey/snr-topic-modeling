NRMA rejects petrol companies' petrol transport costs claims
The NRMA has rejected claims by petrol companies that transport costs are to blame for higher fuel costs at country service stations.
The head of the motoring body, Alan Evans, has told the Senate inquiry into petrol pricing that consolidation of retailers and outlets means prices will only get higher.
He says petrol retailers must be forced to be transparent about why their rural stations charge up to 20 cents a litre more than city outlets.
"Even the oil companies themselves say three cents a litre would account for the freight costs," he said.
"When you look at differentials as we had in the last week between Sydney and Wagga, of nearly 20 cents a litre, 19, you had differentials of 14 between Wagga and Albury on the same day on the average price of fuel, you can't explain it by freight."
But there are bright prospects for an alternative fuel.
An Australian company has been awarded $2 million by the United States Energy Department to trial an alternative hydrogen fuel blend for vehicle engines.
Eden Energy says some American buses will be powered by its hythane mix.
Hythane blends 7 per cent hydrogen with 93 per cent natural gas.
Eden Energy executive chairman Greg Solomon says the US particularly wants the technology because of stringent emissions standards being introduced next year.
