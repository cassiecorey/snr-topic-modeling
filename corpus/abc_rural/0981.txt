Citrus growers set to export to China
Strict quarantine measures have finally been agreed upon to send citrus fruit into China, with the first exports due to leave later this month.
Growers had hoped China would help solve some of Australia's oversupply problems, but Judith Damiani says it is not yet known how much fruit will be exported this year.
Ms Damiani says prices are also uncertain.
"The quarantine requirements make it fairly difficult to put a lot of volume of fruit into that China market," she said.
"So we will have to start very slowly, we'll have to do some trial shipments initially and after two years we will have to look at amending the protocol and making it easier to ship there."
Richie Roberts from Renmark says his fruit company will start packing fruit for China early next week.
"We're very keen to get several containers to China just to test the market because there's so much work that the industry's put in to get access," he said.
