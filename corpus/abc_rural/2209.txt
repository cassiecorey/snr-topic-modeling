QCC takes action against coal mine expansion
An environmental group has taken legal action against a coal mine in Queensland, wanting to make it responsible for any pollution its product causes.
The Queensland Conservation Council (QCC) has lodged an official objection to an extension of the Xstrata-owned Newlands coal mine, about 130 kilometres west of Mackay.
Spokesman Nigel Parratt says the company should invest in clean technology or plant trees to offset emissions the extracted coal will produce.
"If it sets a precedent, we'd certainly like to see other high greenhouse gas - either emitters or users - follow suit," he said.
