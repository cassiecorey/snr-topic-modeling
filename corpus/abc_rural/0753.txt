Gold price fall puzzling
Resource analysts are puzzled why the price of gold suffered a meltdown in New York trade overnight.
The price of gold dropped $US44.50 an ounce, its biggest single day drop since 1991.
Hartley's resource analyst Andrew Rowell cannot explain the decline in gold and copper prices.
"We're not actually really sure as to why it's such a big drop. It came off last night in New York, it started at the start of the day and kept going," he said.
"I guess we're at a bit of a loss to see exactly the reasons why it was so pronounced."
