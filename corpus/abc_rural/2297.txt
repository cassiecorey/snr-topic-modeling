Drought lowers wool production estimates
The latest estimates for wool production this season have fallen further due to the drought.
According to Australian Wool Innovation, shorn wool production for 2006-07 is expected to fall 9 per cent to 421 million kilograms.
The fall is due to a national drop in fleece weights, which are forecast to hit their lowest level in more than 20 years.
Meanwhile wool prices continue to hold onto strong gains achieved in recent weeks, with a slight increase in the market at this week's sales.
