'Pressure on negotiators' to secure better market access
Sheepmeat producers are confident their latest round of talks with the European Commission will lead to a bigger slice of the export market for Australia.
Industry delegates have met with EU commissioners in Brussels to push Australia's case ahead of world trade talks later this month.
Ian Feldtman from the Sheepmeats Council says the pressure is now on trade negotiators to clinch a deal.
"The message we're giving to our Government is that the decisions that are made during this round is something that our industry is going to have to live with for at least the next 10 years," he said.
