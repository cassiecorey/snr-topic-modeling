Farmers dispute Costello's federalism reform plans
The New South Wales Farmers' Association is backing Federal Treasurer Peter Costello in his criticism of Australia's three-tiered system of government, but does not agree with his plans to change it.
Mr Costello has triggered national debate on federalism, by wanting to wrestle all responsibility for utilities and the economy from the state governments, reducing them to branch offices.
Mal Peters, from the association, says giving more power to Canberra is not the answer, and is calling for full-scale reform of Australia's system of government.
"Any further centralisation of power into New South Wales is not good," he said.
"I mean the closer the government gets to the people the better the government is, and that's well recognised by all players in the state and federal spheres.
