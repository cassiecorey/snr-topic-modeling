Sugar cane farmers brace for smut impact
The Queensland government is trying to assess the economic impact of sugar cane smut on the state's sugar industry.
The crop disease was found at Mackay last week, after first being detected near Bundaberg in June.
The Government is moving away from trying to contain the disease.
The Government has appointed an independent economist to head up a team to assess the impacts and identify measures to manage the problem, and facilitate economic recovery.
The team will report by December 18.
A stakeholder meeting on Friday was told replanting with resistant varieties over the next five years will cost an estimated $800 million, with an additional burden of a 10 per cent reduction in yield.
