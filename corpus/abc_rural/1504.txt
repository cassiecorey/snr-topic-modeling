Oil price drop predicted
The price of oil is predicted to drop by almost a third within the next five years.
That is the forecast Angus Walker from chartered accountants Ernst and Young delivered to an oil conference in Perth yesterday.
He says while the US economy is slowing down due to lower domestic spending, it is being balanced out by the expanding economies of China and India.
Mr Walker says that will hold oil prices firm in the short term, before the market corrects.
"The Chinese are expected to increase their use of oil by 156 per cent by 2030, it is the largest increase of oil usage of any country in history," he said.
"In India, it's going to increase it's use of oil by around 124 per cent.
