Harsh weather
In Victoria, harsh weather is taking its toll on grain crops in the Mallee and Wimmera regions.
The combination of high temperatures and dry winds, followed by frosts, has some growers considering harvesting nothing this year.
Department of Primary Industries agronomist Rob Sonogan says the damage has been patchy.
"What we're really seeing as an average across the whole zone is somewhere about 30 per cent of average yield expectation and that's daily decreasing," he said.
