Tomato plant virus spreading
There is confirmation today that the tomato yellow leaf curl virus is spreading in one of Australia's major production areas.
The virus stunts tomato growth and drastically limits yields.
Discovered for the first time in Australia a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane, it has now been identified on two commercial properties near Bundaberg.
Inspections are being planned in other Queensland tomato growing regions.
Chris Adriaansen from the Department of Primary Industries says it is proving difficult to trace the origin of the virus.
"This is what we're finding as we're going through all the properties that we're getting positive diagnosis on - there's no common linkage in terms they're not using the same supply of seedlings, they're not using the same supplier of anything, there's no other linkage," he said.
