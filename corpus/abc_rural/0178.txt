US joins call for end to dairy subsidies
The US has joined Australia and other major dairy exporting countries to call for an end to subsidies, which they say are crippling legitimate trade.
The Global Dairy Alliance has written to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), also calling for greater market access by 2010.
Chairman of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, Allan Burgess, says having support from a heavily subsidised farming country like the US gives the campaign a stronger voice.
"And they still have certain levels of subsidy there and if the WTO changes take place they'll be reduced substantially," he said.
