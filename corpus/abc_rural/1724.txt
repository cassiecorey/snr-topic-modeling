Cash incomes for beef producers halved
A new report says the cash income for beef producers has been halved in the past financial year.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says the figures reflect a trend for producers to hold off selling large numbers of cattle in 2005-06.
Rhonda Treadwell from ABARE'S farm survey and analysis branch says producers have been attempting to build up herd numbers.
"Essentially the farm cash incomes have fallen quite considerably and that is mainly because of the incredibly big build up of cattle numbers across a lot of beef cattle properties, so their profit hasn't fallen as much as their cash income," she said.
But those attempts to build up herds are now being thwarted by the on-going drought, with producers starting to sell large numbers of cattle.
In north-west New South Wales, producer Graham Wilson says his greatest worry is finding enough water for his cattle.
"We haven't had any inflow into our dams for over 12 months and we're getting very critical," he said.
"Our bores on average have gone from about 800-900 gallons an hour down to 200 gallons an hour.
"We need about 40,000 litres of water a day.
