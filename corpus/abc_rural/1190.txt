Online trading opens market to more investors: trader
Day one of online trading at the Chicago Board of Trade has closed, representing a new era for the world's largest commodity trader.
The Board of Trade website says the introduction of electronic trading of agricultural futures contracts is part of its global expansion plans.
Australian trader Corrie Mcgrath says pit traders tend to operate for themselves, while trading online opens up the market to a whole new body of investors.
"Opening up to electronic markets means that a small person can come in through a broker and trade online themselves," she said.
