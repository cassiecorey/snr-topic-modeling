Remote station may be nominated as alternative dump site
There is speculation in the Northern Territory that a remote cattle station could be nominated as an alternative site for a national nuclear waste dump.
Senator Nigel Scullion has intimated that Northern Land Council lands near Tennant Creek are being considered.
One of the few Aboriginal stations in the region is Muckaty on the edge of the Barkly Tableland.
Former station owner Miriam Hagan says while the area is drier than the proposed Top End site, she would still have grave concerns for the cattle country, if the rumour is true.
"I'm quite stunned actually and I do think it would be a profanity to put that on the beloved place where my sisters and I grew up," she said.
"There are, you know, deep underground aquifers, so I think a lot of homework would have to be done.
