Texas weather could impact on Aust cotton prices
Prolonged dry conditions in the American state of Texas could see a lift in cotton prices in Australia.
A global oversupply of cotton and the high Australian dollar are hurting returns for growers at present, with prices well below $400 a bale.
But Cliff White from Queensland Cotton says if the situation in the United States deteriorates, prices for next season could rise above $430 a bale.
"I think it's difficult to see significant change to current crop prices, however over the next few weeks attention is going to be turning more so to the new crop production prospects in the northern hemisphere and at the moment there are one or two concerns on the horizon," he said.
