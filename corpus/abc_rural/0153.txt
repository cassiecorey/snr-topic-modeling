Pilbara escapes major cyclone damage
Western Australia's Pilbara region has escaped major damage from cyclone Glenda despite the category 4 storm reaching speeds of 180 kilometres an hour.
The cyclone crossed the coast last night at Mardie Station, a cattle property 100 kilometres west of Karratha.
After enduring five hours of deafening winds, Mardie pastoralist Richard Climas now has a big clean job up on his hands.
"There's a bit of carnage around, we've got doors off sheds. A big shed door, they're hangar doors so they're pretty big doors and one of them come loose and we happened to be looking out the window and see it go flying past," he said.
"And got a few of the solar panels have blown over actually bent the 50 millimetres square steel, just bent it like toothpicks, so got a bit of work this morning."
Big rainfall from cyclone Glenda is expected to increase the threat of locust plagues in WA.
Entomologist Kevin Waldon says there are already a large number of locusts across the State's agricultural regions.
He is warning farmers to be vigilant because there is a risk that locusts will survive until the beginning of seeding.
"Given the green conditions we've got now, I expect the locusts will survive at least five to six weeks," he said.
