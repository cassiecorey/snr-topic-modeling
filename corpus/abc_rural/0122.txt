Electronic nose could solve sheep industry woes
A small grey box could be the key to reducing fly strike, one of the sheep industry's biggest health problems.
The electronic nose is being trialed by the Sheep Cooperative Research Centre at Armidale, in New South Wales.
It detects the stench of blowfly maggots in sheep near a watering point and sends a signal back to the farm's computer.
Dr Ian Colditz says, if successful, the e-nose could help the industry save more than $160 million a year.
"The device works by having some electronic sensors that are picking up chemicals that are part of an odour and that creates an electrical signal that can be picked up by a computer and could be relayed to the farm office," Dr Colditz said.
