Industry group concerned about lack of initiatives
There is concern about a lack of initiatives in the Budget to improve the national skills base and tackle the labor shortage in Australia.
Although new measures have been announced to make it easier for overseas workers, the Australian Industry Group says the Budget should have made more progress in big nation building projects.
While happy with many of the initiatives announced for business and the road funding, Heather Ridout says there is a long way to go to provide the necessary infrastructure to improve productivity and cope with future demand.
"I think that's another area where there could have been more done," she said.
"They're certainly bringing forward some of the spending which is important, some increase in road funding but it needs a more coherent plan.
"We still need better interaction between road and rail, I think we still need more of a national plan and that's got to be really agreed between the states being very big spenders in this area.
