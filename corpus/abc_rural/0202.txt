Farm succession debate under way in Dubbo
The difficult issue of handing the farm over is being debated at the first national conference on farm succession this week at Dubbo, in New South Wales.
There is a growing recognition that few individual professionals, like accountants, counsellors and consultants have all the skills to help farm families through the succession process.
Victorian accountant Peter Nelson says the conference has helped him realise the benefits of obtaining other specialist advice to help his clients.
"Most definitely and there are people who do these sorts of things, you know they're more trained and suited to the project. We just need to resource them and bring them into our system," he said.
