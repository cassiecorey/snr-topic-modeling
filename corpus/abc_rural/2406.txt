DAIRY FARMERS FEAR FEED PRICE RISES
The dairy industry is worried that a high level of wheat exports could affect local feed grain prices.
The Federal Government is expected to announce tomorrow, whether it will allow companies other than AWB to ship wheat overseas.
Head of Australian Dairy Farmers John McQueen says any further increases in grain prices would hurt the industry.
"As far as domestic prices go, it should make no impact whatsoever, and we would be very disappointed if exports did anything to domestic prices.
"Domestic prices should not at any time go above import parity and our preference would be lower than import parity.
"Export licences should not give a green light to anybody increasing domestic prices for grain√Ç".
