Drought aid assistance increased
The New South Wales Government has announced further drought assistance for farmers and irrigators.
The extra assistance will see drought aid increased to $30 million this financial year.
Irrigators in the Lachlan Valley will be the biggest winner from the announcement, with their fixed water charges waived this season, saving them around $5 million.
The State Government has also extended its drought support workers program until June next year.
The Premier has waived the wild dog destruction board fees for farmers in the western division and deferred the pest insect levy for this financial year.
NSW Premier Morris Iemma says they are also increasing mental health services.
"There is a real human toll here. Extra stress, anxiety, indeed depression as farming families suffer as a result of losing their income," he said.
