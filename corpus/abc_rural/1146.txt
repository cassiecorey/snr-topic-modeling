Farmer hopes assistance package will keep town afloat
The Western Australian Government has announced an assistance package for farmers in some of the State's most severely drought-affected regions.
Farmer Glenn Thomas was one of 150 locals at a dry season crisis meeting in the wheatbelt town of Mullewa yesterday.
Although details of the package are not yet known, Mr Thomas hopes it will help to keep his community afloat through the worst farming year he has ever known.
"There's different situations throughout the shires. There's many in the outlying areas that have really only had one good season in the last five or six and, really, that's just not enough to get back on your feet," he said.
