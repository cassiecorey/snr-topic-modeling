AWB delegation to investigate wheat pesticide find
A 50,000 tonne shipment of Australian wheat has been stopped from unloading in India after tests revealed unacceptable levels of pesticide.
The shipment, which left the port of Adelaide last week, is now on standby at Chennai port, awaiting further testing from Indian and Australian authorities.
It is the first consignment of a half million tonne tender won by exporter AWB and spokesman Peter McBride says the company is sending its own delegation.
"They have identified that there is a high level of pesticide reading, so AWB is sending a high level delegation to India which will leave today to meet with our customers to address the issue and obtain more information," he said.
"We've run tests here as the ships leave and we'll do that for future vessels.
"We can't really provide further details until we have met with our customers and hopefully we'll have further information later this week or early next week."
