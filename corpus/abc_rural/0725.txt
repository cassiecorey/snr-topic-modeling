No quick answer to cane toads, say scientists
Scientists have been meeting in Brisbane this week to work out how to beat the cane toad problem.
More than 40 researchers have shared their work at the national cane toad workshop, and heard evidence of how the toxic toad is adapting to its environment.
Ideas thrown up include bio-control methods and repelling devices, and Dr Tony Robinson from the CSIRO says while there is some inspiring work being done, there's still no magic answer.
"We're talking five to seven years, I mean that's the sort of range for any of those projects, we can't offer any immediate solution to the cane toad problem, which is frustrating," he said.
