Pet's death renews hunting debate
The debate over allowing licensed hunters to cull feral pests in state parks has flared again in New South Wales, after a domestic pet belonging to a camper was shot.
Hunters have been given access to 152 state forests this year to help reduce pest problems.
The owner of the dead kelpie, Ross Clissold, has camped in the Double Duke State Forest on the north coast for four years.
He says he had no idea hunters were being used, and he is now reluctant to take his family to the area.
