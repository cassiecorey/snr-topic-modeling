Poppy processor slashes prices
The poppy industry has taken another hit, with processor Tasmanian Alkaloids slashing prices to growers by 17 per cent.
Two weeks ago Tasmania's other processor, GlaxomSmithKline cut its crop area by 90 per cent.
Lyndley Chopping from the Tasmanian Poppy Growers Association says the latest price cut cannot be supported.
"We cannot recommend the prices to the growers and we're not recommending the prices to the growers," he said.
"We feel as though the company is taking advantage of the situation.
"We're very upset with the result of this. So the growers do their figures as to whether they grow again or whether they give the land a spell, or whether they go into another crop or another enterprise. That's their call."
