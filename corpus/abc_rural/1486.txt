Golden spinifex could cut exploration costs
Spinifex grass might be a natural signpost to untold wealth, according to research findings in the Tanami Desert.
Scientists have discovered that spinifex plants can carry traces of gold in their leaves, if they are growing above a mineral deposit.
Further research needs to be done, but mining companies say the discovery could lead to big savings in exploration costs.
Dr Stephen Rogers from the Cooperative Research Centre for Landscape Environments and Mineral Exploration, says the grass is proving to be a natural metal detector.
"What the plant does is because it lives in very arid regions it needs to get its water from the ground water so it puts the most of its energy into creating this huge single root that penetrates very, very deeply into the regolith, into the cover of the landscape to the ground water," he said.
