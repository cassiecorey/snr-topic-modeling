Official aims to settle trade dispute with Indonesia
Efforts are under way to rescue Australia's $35 million horticulture trade with Indonesia.
Exports of grapes, citrus, apples and pears are effectively suspended after the Indonesian Government imposed surprise new export protocols.
Australian quarantine officials stopped issuing permits for Indonesia on Thursday, although a shipment of grapes worth nearly a million dollars was already at sea and is in danger of being rejected.
David Minus from the Australian Horticultural Exporters Association says a federal trade official has been dispatched to Indonesia to try to settle the dispute.
"Australia is fighting for its horticultural survival and we need every market we can hang on to," he said.
"Indonesia is after all a big market, it's not the wealthiest but it's a very big market and it's right on our doorstep.
"We're ideally placed to serve it with temperate fruit and sub-tropical citrus that they have difficulty growing in Indonesia."
Table grape growers hope the quarantine dispute can be resolved quickly.
Australian Table Grape Association president Nick Muraca says despite initial fears, the political dispute over asylum seekers from Papua does not appear to have caused the problem.
"I don't believe that to be the case nor do we have any reason to believe that that is the case," he said.
