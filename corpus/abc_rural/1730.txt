New irrigation model saving water
A water cooperative in Western Australia is being held up as a model example for the irrigation sector.
The Harvey Water Cooperative in south-west Western Australia has replaced open irrigation channels with pipes, creating water savings of about 25 per cent each year.
The saved water is piped to Perth to be used in the urban area.
Dan Norton has been named Rural Achiever of the Year at the Royal Show for his contribution to the cooperative, and he hopes others can benefit from the project.
"By piping the system and eliminating the irrigation channels you cut those losses by 25-30 per cent, which is [the] world's best practice for an open channel system," he said.
