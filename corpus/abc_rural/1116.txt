Wine glut blamed for price drop
Wine prices have hit an all-time low, with a major supermarket chains selling bottles of clean skin chardonnay and merlot for $2.00 a bottle.
The move has sent shockwaves through the battling industry, with the wines normally selling for $6.00.
The massive discounting is being blamed on the wine glut and follows a trend set in the US in 2003.
Chief executive of the Wine Makers Federation of Australia Stephen Strachan says it is a very worrying development.
"I don't think anyone in the industry would've expected that we get to that point," he said.
"What it does is it undermines the strength of existing brands and it means that the temptations for those brands to try and meet similar price points is there because they obviously want to be able to sell their wine.
