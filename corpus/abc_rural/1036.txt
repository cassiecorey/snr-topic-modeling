NT banana growers cashing in on prices
Banana growers in the Northern Territory are continuing to receive record prices following the destruction of major plantations by cyclone Larry.
The Territory's largest grower also operates in north Queensland and the Darwin farm has been a lifeline for the business.
Farm manager Mark Smith says the Territory still has the cheapest bananas in the nation.
"Up until the cyclone we would lose money sending fruit down south. The local market has kept us afloat," he said.
"The cheapest bananas in Australia are in Darwin at the moment, so it looks like the prices are up at around $15 per kilogram elsewhere in the southern states.
