Rain lifts Tasmania's spirits
There has been very welcome rain in Tasmania to lift spirits with falls of between 10 and 30 millimetres.
The state's river levels are at their lowest since record-keeping began 40 years ago.
The very dry southern midlands district of Tunbridge received about 30 millimetres, which Greg Powell says was more than some neighbouring areas.
"We'll we're probably praying a bit harder ... but no, no it's been great for the country," he said.
"I'm a contractor you know and a lot of farmers were putting stock on cereal crops which we wouldn't end up harvesting in the finish, so it's sort of a snowball effect.
