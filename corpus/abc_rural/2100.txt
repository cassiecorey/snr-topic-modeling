O'Connor to fight preselection decision
Federal Labor's agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor says he will appeal against his party's decision not to support him as an election candidate.
Mr O'Connor lost preselection in his Victorian seat of Corio earlier this year.
Leader Kim Beazley says Mr O'Connor will not be removed from as the Opposition's agriculture spokesman before next year's federal election.
Mr O'Connor says he is determined to stay on.
"I don't intend to roll over to a bunch of factional spivs," he said.
