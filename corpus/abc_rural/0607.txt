Cole inquiry
In related news, the head of the Australian Federal Police will meet with Oil for Food Commissioner Terence Cole next week, as he weighs up whether to investigate evidence from the inquiry.
AFP commissioner Mick Keelty has told a Senate estimates hearing there has been no decision on whether to press charges against AWB employees.
Under questioning he told the hearing evidence from the Cole inquiry is yet to be referred to the federal police.
"Not as yet Senator, I have a meeting with the royal commissioner on the first of June," he said.
"I don't suppose he's indicated what meeting's about?" asked the senator.
"Well I don't think that's an appropriate question to ask the commissioner in any event, even if he knew," Mr Keelty said.
Meanwhile the Federal Opposition has stepped up attacks on AWB for claiming a tax deduction on its $300 million kickback payments to Iraq.
Labor says AWB has legal advice claiming it will not suffer a tax penalty on the deduction, and has called on the Government to step-in.
But Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says the matter is in the hands of the Australian Tax Office, and it will decide if AWB should be penalised.
