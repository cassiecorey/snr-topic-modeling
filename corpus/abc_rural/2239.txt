Senator confident of support for PM's wheat export model
An influential Liberal senator says he is confident the Prime Minister will put forward a model for the future of wheat export marketing which most government politicians and wheat growers will be able to support.
New South Wales Senator Bill Heffernan says no government politicians are calling for the complete scrapping of the single desk.
Senator Heffernan says the model will retain the advantages for wheat growers that having a single desk gives them in a world market distorted by different trade barriers and subsidies.
"While Australia's wheat farmers to some extent have been betrayed by the past, we've got to look to the future and offer opportunities that open up the market to growers and not necessarily to punters, carpetbaggers and wheat traders," he said.
