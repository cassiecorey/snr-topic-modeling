AWB wheat export veto laws passed
The Federal Parliament has passed laws stripping AWB of its wheat export veto, handing it to Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran for six months.
Mr McGauran told Parliament the move would give certainty to wheat growers, particularly in Western Australia, providing a range of options for selling their wheat.
