Stronger quarantine conditions for imported prawns recommended
Biosecurity Australia has recommended tougher quarantine restrictions on prawn imports, which could effectively end the trade.
The domestic industry has called for an end to imports due to disease concerns, although importers oppose any tougher restrictions.
Federal Fisheries Minister Eric Abetz says if the draft recommendations are adopted, most of the countries which currently send prawns to Australia will not be able to prove they are free of disease.
