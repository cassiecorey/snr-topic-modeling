AWB's wheat export decision 'disgraceful'
There has been an angry reaction to AWB's decision to block 12 applications to export more than 3 million tonnes of wheat.
The applications were by several companies looking to export to eight countries but AWB has used its veto powers under the Wheat Marketing Act to prevent the move.
Chairman of AWB International Ian Donges says the decision will protect the financial interests of wheat growers delivering grain to the National Pool.
"Quite clearly, if we were to accept the permits that total 3 million tonnes this year we would be derelict in our duty," he said.
"We are now looking at a potential harvest or a pool delivery of 4 million tonnes so it's very important to maximise those pool returns that we have every tonne available to service the international market place."
But WA-based grain handler CBH has described AWB's decision as disgraceful.
The co-operative wanted to export wheat to its South-East Asian flour mills.
It is the second time CBH has been knocked back and chief executive Imre Mencshely says AWB has again jeopardised the future of growers in the west.
"We cannot understand how an organisation can hide behind legislation to make a decision of this nature," he said.
"We've come out and we've said that we can do this on a regular basis and we've said we'll be out there for five years.
"To deny the growers of Western Australian $40 million to $50 million in a year of drought, we just cannot comprehend an organisation coming out in that way."
The Federal Government says it will not be pressured into changing the single desk wheat export system before the outcome of the oil-for-food inquiry.
Some Coalition MPs are calling for AWB's veto power to be removed but Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says that will not happen yet.
"AWB and other bulk handlers and other interested parties all know that," he said.
