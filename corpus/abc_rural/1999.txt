Tough decisions facing irrigators
South Australia's peak irrigators body says some farmers may not survive the latest cut in water allocations.
River Murray water entitlements have been cut from 70 to 60 per cent after another month of record low inflows across the Murray Darling Basin.
Ian Zadow from SA Murray Irrigators says some will have to make tough decisions in the coming weeks.
"I'm sure that this is going to create real problems for a lot of irrigators," he said.
