Priority scheme in place for dwindling Q fever vaccine supplies
Meatworkers will be given priority access to the last remaining doses of Q fever vaccine to protect against the debilitating disease that is spread to human through contact with infected feral and domestic livestock.
This year's demand for the vaccine is expected to exceed current supplies, and fresh stocks cannot be produced until a new lab opens early next year.
Dr Rachel David, from CSL Pharmaceuticals, the only company in the world that makes Q Vax, has now set up a scheme to reduce the impact of the looming shortage.
"We've put in place a prioritisation system so that people involved directly in meat processing will be able to contact CSL and get access to the vaccine as a priority," she said.
