Organic beef producers feeling drought
Organic cattle producers in the outback channel country of Queensland and South Australia are finding it hard to meet demand because of the continuing drought.
OBE Beef, which supplies grass-fed organic beef to the United States, Europe and Asia, is finding it tough as dry conditions keep cattle numbers low.
Sharon Oldfield from Cowarie Station on the Birdsville Track, who supplies organic beef, says they have had to halve their cattle herd.
"We wouldn't have had a good general summer rain probably for four or five years now, in some areas it's been up to six years," she said.
