AWS announces loss
The wool industry's grower-funded marketing arm has posted a $316,000 annual loss.
Australian Wool Services' (AWS) chairman Barry Walker says the company's Woolmark brand and market research divisions both returned profits.
But its processing section, Andar, returned a deficit and the company's substantial debt to a UK pension fund drained $1.3 million from the business.
Mr Walker says the organisation is battling the effects of the drought and would be deeper in debt if it had not cut costs earlier in the year.
"I think the management did a huge job to reduce the costs against decreased income to actually get us to a loss factor in the finish of $300,000," he said.
"We're finding that the whole wool chain, from farm right through to retail, is extremely difficult.
