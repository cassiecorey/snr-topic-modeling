McGuigan Simeon rejects analyst's prices
Wine giant McGuigan Simeon has told growers in the Riverland and Sunraysia it will not accept prices set by an independent analyst last week.
The analyst was called into settle a dispute over how much the winery was prepared to pay growers for grapes already delivered.
Chris Byrne from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association says the company must now explain why it will not accept the prices.
