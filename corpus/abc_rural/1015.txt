Fuel prices changing rural lifestyles
High fuel prices are changing how rural families live, with some dropping children's sporting commitments and car pooling with neighbours.
The latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics show transport, food and groceries and recreation are the three biggest expenses for rural household budgets.
Queensland beef producer Georgie Somerset believes country people spend more on recreation because they are spending more time on the farm.
"Perhaps there's a sense there of 'well we'll go and do this while it's in town, or we'll take up the opportunity to go to a performance'," he said.
"If you're not going to get away from where you live then you may as well make the most of what you've got there and so yes I think there probably has been some more spending on things like a DVD machine and a decent TV because they're actually spending more weeks at home and less weeks away on holidays."
The New South Wales Irrigators Council says it will withdraw support for the National Water Initiative, unless the federal and state governments make radical changes.
The council's chief executive, Doug Miell, says the initiative is "off the rails" and will place a huge financial burden on farmers and rural communities.
