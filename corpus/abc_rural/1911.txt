Group to consider moratorium over land clearing
An important meeting of land managers is taking place today in the Northern Territory's Douglas Daly region, south-west of Darwin.
Allocation of water and land clearing head the agenda of the Government-appointed advisory group, which is preparing to make recommendations.
Pastoralists, like Diana Elliot of Kingfisher Station, want the moratorium over land clearing lifted quickly.
She says broken promises about development have prompted some investors to consider seeking compensation.
"At the moment we have cleared one-seventh of our block, and we would be looking to clear at least say 30 per cent," she said.
