City residents rally around drought-stricken counterparts
Charities say there is growing support from city people wanting to help rural Australia through the drought.
Queensland-based Aussie Helpers says people and businesses from all along the east coast have offered free holiday accommodation, while some Brisbane residents have driven into outback Queensland to donate groceries.
Beverly Kerr from St Vincent de Paul has started a rural task force to coordinate support in the ACT and New South Wales and says she only realised how bad it was when she visited rural Australia.
"When I was asked to form this task force I thought what am I going to do, I don't know anything about this drought, I live in Wollongong near the beach," she said.
"So I drove to Broken Hill for their 100th anniversary, instead of flying I drove.
"You can read it in the paper and you can think 'oh that's really bad' but actually seeing it and talking to people.
"I mean some people on those farms have been there for generations and generations, what do they do?"
Meanwhile farm workers are urging their bosses to be honest about the future of their jobs during the drought.
Victorian dairy farm worker Nat Watson says employees who are kept in the dark can become anxious about their job security.
"They're coming home stressed and its affecting their family life because they don't know if there is going to be on food on the table tomorrow," he said.
