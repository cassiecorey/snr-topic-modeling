Indigenous communities urged to take better care of dogs
With animal numbers on the rise in remote communities, Indigenous communities are being urged to take better care of their dogs to help improve their own health.
A national dog conference in Darwin today is trying to unite Indigenous families and reduce livestock losses.
Community leaders, vets and health workers have come together to share ideas, including the development of shared responsibility agreements to attract funding.
Dr Mark Lawrie from the RSPCA says that might help in a range of ways.
"I guess there's another over-arching thing that we're looking at at this conference too and that's the concept of the linkage between violence to animals and people," he said.
