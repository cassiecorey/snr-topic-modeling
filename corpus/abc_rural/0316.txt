Fodder export company invests in Douglas-Daly region
Despite a moratorium on land clearing and uncertainty over water allocations, development in the Douglas-Daly region, 200 kilometres south of Darwin, is still going ahead.
Northern Australia Fodder Exports has bought the first of what it hopes will be a number of properties growing alfalfa for the Japanese and Korean dairy markets.
Chief executive officer Peter Ryan says there will be an initial investment of around $10 million, as a sign of faith in the region's future.
"I believe that it presents great opportunities and great natural advantages with the quality and the size of the water resource, and the climatic advantages coupled with the geographic advantages," he said.
