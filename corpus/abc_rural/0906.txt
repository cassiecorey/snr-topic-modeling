Shareholders show support for dairy group
Shareholders have voted down a push to disband Western Australia's only representative dairy group.
A resolution was put forward late last year to dissolve the organisation, amid claims it had failed to have an impact on the struggling sector.
Following yesterday's vote, director Jim Fremantle says there now needs to be an overhaul of the processing sector.
