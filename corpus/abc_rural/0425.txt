Farmers battle fleabane
Farmers in Western Australia are battling a nightmare weed which can take over paddocks and is difficult to kill.
The area affected by fleabane on the south coast is increasing rapidly, with the tall woody plant also spreading into agricultural areas further north.
Dr Sally Peltzer from the state Department of Agriculture and Food says good summer rainfall has made the problem worse.
"I've been out and about actually trying to collect a bit of fleabane and I have seen some pretty nasty paddocks," she said.
"It looks worse because they're sort of tall and hairy looking so that doesn't tend to look, compared to the other, pasture plants or whatever."
