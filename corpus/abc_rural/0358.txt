Panel urges national approach to GM technology regulation
There is a call today for a national approach to the regulation of gene technology because of confusion caused by state-based bans on genetically modified (GM) crops.
The Gene Technology Act was introduced in 2000 to oversee the use of GM technology in Australia but since then all states except Queensland and the Northern Territory have imposed their own rules.
Chairwoman of an independent panel which has reviewed the Act, Susan Timbs, says the regulations have become too confusing.
"This was a point that was made very strongly to us by industry, that if they go through and get their approval from the regulator, suddenly they feel that there is a complete block because they don't know the criteria that they need to meet to convince the relevant state governments," she said.
