Wine export prices drop
The latest wine industry survey has found wine export prices are down by a third since 2002 and 40 per cent of Australian wineries are running at a loss.
The Deloitte Wine Industry Benchmarking Survey indicates many wineries are struggling to survive, particularly in export markets.
Deliotte partner Stephen Harvey says the big supermarket chains in Europe have taken advantage of the Australian wine glut and are forcing prices down, and the whole industry is feeling the pain.
"We are seeing a lot of it go over for buyers' own brands in the big supermarket chains, your Sainburys, Tescos, Aldis etc," he said.
"That of course does have a flow-on effect to the branded wines. If people are able to buy buyers' own brands at very cheap prices, it naturally adds some pricing pressure to your more popular and well-known brands."
Meanwhile, grape growers in South Australia's Riverland have welcomed the proposal for a partial compensation package.
About 600 people attended a rally yesterday, hearing proposals from the local grower association, which will be put to Friday's wine industry summit in Melbourne.
The package recommends growers with uncontracted grapes be paid $5,000 per hectare to not harvest them in the hope of reducing the national oversupply.
The $80 million cost would be shared by governments and industry.
Loxton grower Glen Arnold says he hopes the proposal is considered.
"It's a way forward for growers to have some hope," he said.
