Farmers hit out at dept land clearing inspection methods
Farmers in western New South Wales have vowed to prevent state Department of Natural Resources officials from entering their properties to conduct land clearing inspections.
The farmers are angry at recent compliance checks where the department used a police escort.
Doug Menzies says 200 farmers who attended a meeting in Nyngan are fed up with what they say is unworkable legislation and heavy handed government approach.
"We've tried every legal avenue we can and we just get stonewalled every time," he said.
