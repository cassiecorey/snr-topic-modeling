Regional family day care operators fear for future
Family day care operators in many regional areas are worried they could be forced to reduce services or even close within months because of funding shortfalls.
The threat comes on top of a drop in available childcare places over the past year due to changes to funding.
Tracey Guerin from the Alice Springs Family Day Care Centre says the situation will get worse unless the federal Budget includes more financial support.
"I have grave concerns for the future of the service. I don't believe that we'll be funded to the same level as we have been and I think that we will either have to look at offering less of a service or closing all together," she said.
