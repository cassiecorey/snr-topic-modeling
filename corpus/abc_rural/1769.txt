Mango prices drop as harvest picks up
The price of a tray of mangoes has halved in the past fortnight, as the Northern Territory harvest gets into full swing.
The Docking family, who are based on the fringes of Darwin's rural area at Berry Springs, are making the most of drier early build-up weather.
It can be blisteringly hot, up to 35 degrees in the shade, with humidity easily 80 per cent at picking.
But so far, 3,000 trays of mangoes have been plucked from their orchard.
That is compared to 220,000 trays across all of Darwin.
Strong winds have scratched the surface of some fruit, increasing the amount of seconds and the early premium prices have already fallen away, to below $30 a tray in the Sydney markets.
