Ag Census expected to show increase in farm numbers
The country's biggest collection of agricultural information is expected to show an increase in the number of farms, despite the drought.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics is asking 190,000 primary producers for production figures and stock numbers for the 2006 Agricultural Census.
The last census, five years ago, identified 130,000 genuine farm businesses operating in Australia.
But the bureau's Allan Nicholls is expecting an extra 30,000 small farms to participate this time.
"They've certainly been there all along but they've been quite small and we haven't been able to pick them up through our normal channels," he said.
