Retailers question winemakers' environmental credentials
Australian winemakers are being told they need to show they are clean and green, with a growing number of overseas retailers asking about the environmental credentials of their suppliers.
Seventy per cent of the nation's wine grape crush is already signed up to a stewardship program which documents good environmental practices.
Amy Russell, from the Winemakers Federation, says retailers in the United Kingdom in particular are concerned about water use, waste and greenhouse gas emissions.
"There's certainly increasing pressure out there from non-government organisations and even from some retailers to actually prove any claims that you may have," she said.
"We do have that inherent position of being clean and green and it's not just in the wine industry it's in many industries.
