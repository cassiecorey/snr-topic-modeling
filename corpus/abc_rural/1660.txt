US calls for farm subsidies changes
US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns is calling for sweeping reforms to farm subsidies to head off a possible new challenge before the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
But a top farm group is opposing the move, in what is shaping up to be a major fight over US farm policy.
Brazil has already won a WTO case against US cotton subsidies.
Now Mr Johanns says Brazil may strike again.
"What they're after is our marketing loan program and our counter cyclical program," he said.
But the American Farm Bureau (AFB) and other groups say they have not heard this and bureau trade adviser Chris Garza says his group warns against premature concessions.
"If we go in and make any changes to the farm Bill now we could get a WTO, in which case, countries could ask us to do more," he said.
