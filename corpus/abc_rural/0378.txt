Councils seek to fill jobs through Melbourne advertising
A group of western Victorian councils have resorted to advertising in Melbourne newspapers to try to lure workers.
Ararat Rural City and the shires of Northern Grampians and Pyrenees will use ratepayer and state funds for the campaign, to address the skills shortage.
Ararat Council's rural development manager Mark Hogan says tradespeople, medical professionals and agricultural workers are all in short supply.
"The key area that made our mind up that this was the way we needed to go was some recent research from state and federal governments which showed that the number of people applying for jobs in our region and the Wimmera area is very small," he said.
