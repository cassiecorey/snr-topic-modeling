King Island to sign Kyoto protocol
Tasmania's King Island is planning to sign the Kyoto protocol and formally commit to reducing its greenhouse emissions.
While the island is well-known for its clean and green produce, residents believe that signing the agreement would further boost its reputation.
Mayor Charles Arnold says he hopes the move will also send a clear message to the Federal Government, which is refusing to ratify the protocol.
"Our politicians think by their hip pocket and if they see that the people in the community want to stand up and be heard, I think that's what should happen," he said.
