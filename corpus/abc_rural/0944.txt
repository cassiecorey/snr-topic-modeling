Hayes to head international wine body
An Australian has been named president of the peak international body representing winemakers and grapegrowers from 42 nations.
Peter Hayes will head up the International Organisation for Wine and Vine for the next three years.
The organisation sets industry standards and regulations for all member countries
Mr Hayes, a director and former chief executive of the Grape and Wine Research Development Council, says he was taken aback by his appointment.
"I find it a bit surprising quite frankly, but I think it is a sign of the times," he said.
