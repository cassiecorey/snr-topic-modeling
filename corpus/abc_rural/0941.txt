Nullabor pastoralists granted rent subsidies
Pastoralists on the Nullarbor who are suffering through drought conditions have been offered a sweetener by the West Australian Government.
They have been told they are not eligible for exceptional circumstances funding, but the Government will contribute $80,000 towards pastoral lease rents and agriculture protection rates.
Pastoralist Rod Campbell says the money is welcome but pastoralists still believe they should be eligible for EC funds.
"We're mystified about the criteria etc but I think the Minister's addressing that very nicely," he said.
