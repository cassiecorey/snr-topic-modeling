Fungi used in weed kill trials
Scientists are closer to understanding how native fungi can kill introduced weeds across northern Australia.
Trials in north Queensland have identified 10 varieties of fungi which have been causing dieback in parkinsonia, a weed which threatens 75 per cent of Australia's north.
Victor Galea from the University of Queensland says it is unusual to find a native organism that can be used as a cheap biological control agent.
"We suspect that a lot of these fungi which are in the soil are adapted to live in that situation and parkinsonia is not adapted so well," he said.
