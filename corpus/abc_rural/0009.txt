Organisation to step up banning rodeos campaign
Tasmania's rodeo industry is under sustained attack from animal rights activists after another animal had to be destroyed at a weekend event.
A bucking horse was put down after breaking a leg at Ulverstone on Saturday.
Two weeks ago, a bull was destroyed after apparently breaking its back during a bull-riding competition at Carrick.
The owner of both animals, Brian Fish, says they were unfortunate accidents and not an animal welfare issue.
But Emma Haswell from Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania says her organisation will up its efforts to have rodeos banned.
