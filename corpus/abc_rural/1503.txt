Farmers to reap super change rewards
Farmers are expected to be the big winners from changes to superannuation legislation introduced to Federal Parliament this week by the Treasurer, Peter Costello.
Until next June, retiring farmers will be able to tip up to $1 million into their super schemes, to make the most of tax-free payouts available to the over-60s from July 1.
Richard Gilbert from the Investment and Financial Planning Services Association expects to see a big shift in property.
"I think there is a general feeling around the industry I work in that there will be movements of assets in order to take advantage of this," he said.
"Typically it's probably the property assets, probably the things that they'll be looking at are the lumpy assets that may well be moved.
"But those decisions have to be done carefully and with due judgement on the market, need to think twice if they're selling it off at a fire sale price."
But there are fears the changes could make it harder for managed investment schemes to attract funds.
The schemes, which include plantation timber and almond groves, have traditionally relied on tax breaks to attract support.
But Michael Spinks from the Institute of Chartered Accountants says investors might now top up their super instead.
"Prior to the changes a lot of investors probably saw agribusiness as a good way of reducing their tax," he said.
