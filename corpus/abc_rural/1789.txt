Zinc price soars
The price of zinc has soared to $US1.66 a pound as world stocks slip to their lowest level in 15 years.
Zinc miner Zinifex says official stocks are likely to drop to zero next year because of low production.
Commodities analyst with the ANZ bank, Andrew Harrington, says tight supply on the London Metals Exchange will push prices up further.
"What they're saying is the official stocks in LME [London Metals Exchange] will probably get very, very low and obviously as they do that prices go up," he said.
