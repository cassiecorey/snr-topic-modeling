Big drop in US wheat production tipped
The US Agriculture Department is tipping an 11 per cent drop in wheat production there over the next 12 months.
The latest forecast is for a total harvest in 2006-07 of $1.8 billion bushels.
USDA World Agriculture Outlook Board Chairman Gerald Bange blames chronic drought and tough competition from Australia and Canada for lower exports.
"We're looking at exports, beginning June 1 at about 900 million bushels, which would be about 100 million bushels lower than we will export in the 2005/06 year, which is currently estimated at an even 1 billion bushels," he said.
Mr Bange says part of the reason is a stronger US price forecast in '06/'07 due to lower production and tighter ending stocks.
Wheat prices look set to improve on the back of the USDA report, which has also revealed a substantial increase in corn exports.
There is also higher domestic demand in the US for corn to make ethanol.
Natham Omodei from commodity trader Plum Grove, says that should make wheat more attractive as feed for livestock and drive up prices.
"They increased use for ethanol production, which really cut their stock forecasts for 2006-2007," he said.
