NSW irrigators fight for water fee relief
Irrigators in New South Wales are currently having no joy in receiving assistance for their fixed water charges.
Only one inland valley has received a general security allocation this season and there are demands for fee relief across the state.
Chairman of Jemalong Irrigation Ted Morgan says the New South Wales Government must develop its own assistance package for irrigators.
"What we're really looking for is where a set of rules is set up for the valleys where, when you have zero allocation some sort of principles kick in like exceptional circumstances," he said.
