Sheep thefts may lead to more livestock truck checks
Police on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula say they may resort to checking every livestock truck on the region's roads after a growing number of sheep thefts.
About 1,200 sheep have been reported stolen this year, including 250 head from near Wudinna this week.
Senior-Sergeant Paul Roberts says all peninsula police stations have been alerted.
"It may well be that we want the staff to stop all stock crates that are moving throughout the local service area and along the highways," he said.
