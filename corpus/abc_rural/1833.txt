Grain price hikes felt from the trough to the plate
It's going to cost a lot more to put food on your plate, as the flow on effect from a hike in grain continues down the line. As the State's overall supply dwindles, it's not just the bigger agricultural industries like cattle feedlots feeling the pinch, small time producers, egg farmers, bakers, and even coffee shops are being forced to increase their price to keep afloat.
Fiona Eastwell and her family has just bought an agricultural business near Townsville and while it's too early for them to feel it in the north, their coffee shop and restaurant business in south-east Queensland has seen the consequences.
"We are considering pulling sandwich prices up, meal prices up- just a little of everything over the board because it effects from making pikelets, from buying in gateaus and cakes."
Jeff Ironside owns 12 Oaks Poultry, Townsville and manages 200,000 chooks to supply eggs to a number of businesses. He's seen a huge increase in grain prices, as he buys over 5000 tonnes of grain annually and is looking at a rather dramatic increase in his own prices to maintain a profit margin.
"Normally we're looking to stock up, but there's not a lot of grain on the ground and what there is, is as dear as poison."
David Henderson from Riverina Australia, a grain supplier based in Oakey in south-east Queensland says there is a major shortage of sorghum, wheat and barley, and as their product is sent to agencies all around Queensland can see the whole industry from the paddock to the trough.
He says he hasn't seen a price hike as severe as this before.
