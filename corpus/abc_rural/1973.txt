Commission proposes increasing semi-trailer loads
Load limits for semi-trailers could be increased by five tonnes under a draft proposal from the National Transport Commission.
Trucks with twin-steer axles would be able to carry a maximum gross weight of 47.5 tonnes.
The commission says any additional damage to roads would be offset by higher registration charges.
Spokesman Paul Sullivan says the plan would result in productivity and safety gains for the logging, mining and construction industries.
"It originally came from requests from industry in the logging, mining and construction industries that need to carry a little bit of extra mass," he said.
