Dry winter forces record yarding
The dry seasonal conditions are forcing record numbers of sheep and lambs onto the market in southern New South Wales.
More than 60,000 head are being offloaded in Wagga today.
The Wagga saleyards is bursting at the seams with a record yarding of almost 40,000 lambs and more than 20,000 sheep.
President of the Wagga Livestock Selling Association Peter Cabot says it has been a dry winter and unless it rains soon the sell off will continue.
"We're seeing a lot of the pastures die and people are now realising they've got six months of summer and they're probably looking at March or April to feed sheep.
