CSIRO report urges rural, urban water trading
A major scientific report says city water authorities should be allowed to buy water from farmers to sustain the growing urban population.
The CSIRO says without reform, water costs in metropolitan areas could rise more than 10 times over the next 25 years.
The report from the CSIRO and Monash University predicts Perth, Brisbane and Sydney will be the worst affected cities with the price of water jumping up to 10 times unless better reforms are put in place.
Three models have been tested and CSIRO says the most successful would be a combination of urban and rural water trading, alongside more efficient water use including desalination plants.
And while farmers could make a lot of money from water trading, the system would change the face of agriculture in Australia.
The CSIRO's Mike Young says urban/rural water trading is already working in South Australia and WA farmers are leading the way in saving water.
"Agriculture's a lot more skilful in improving water use efficiency and in 25 years time they've made a 50 per cent greater advance than urban Australia, so there's a challenge for urban Australia to catch up and show they're actually as smart as our farmers are," Mr Young said.
Bit some irrigators are worried about the social impact of water being diverted into the capital cities.
Although he believes some form of water trading with the cities is inevitable, Victorian dairy farmer Max Fehring says governments need to make sure urban residents share the cost of water infrastructure with rural communities.
