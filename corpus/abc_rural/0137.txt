European winter hits global poppy industry
The global poppy crop has shrunk, with the estimated surplus also half the size of this time last year.
An exceptionally cold European winter and smaller plantings have caused the drop.
Lindley Chopping, from the Tasmanian Poppy Growers Association, says the worldwide glut had previously equalled two and a half year's supply of opiates.
"It's down to about one and half years supply," she said.
