Senate committee hears grain growers' concerns
The Wheat Export Authority says it has not yet held talks with the Federal Government about increased powers to regulate wheat exports.
Officers have told the Senate estimates agriculture committee that they expect the authority's role to change in the wake of the Cole inquiry.
But committee chairman, Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan has told the hearing that concern among growers over low pool payments and AWB's service agreement, mean there is pressure to change the system.
"It's as if you've discovered a betrayal, a sense of betrayal, amongst a lot of wheat growers and to get the sense of betrayal, they say a picture paints a thousand words," he said.
