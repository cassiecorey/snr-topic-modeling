Uranium drilling draws positive results
Australia's next uranium mine could be north-west of Alice Springs in central Australia.
Deep Yellow, a Western Australian uranium exploration company, released positive results this week from its exploration drilling at Napperby Station, 150 kilometres from Alice Springs.
Stockbroker Matthew Baker says that at just under half a pound per tonne reported it could be economic.
"It's still very early stage but if you're looking at uranium companies, to me the angle is quite simple," he said.
"You look at them and say 'well I want one in the Territory because it doesn't matter what the Government here says'.
