New dam plan angers farmers
Farmers are angry over plans for a big new dam in south-east Queensland.
Landholders near Gympie are planning a campaign to try to force the State Government to scrap the idea, which involves the resumption of 900 properties.
The dam is designed to fix the water crisis in the south-east corner of Queensland and will cover 7,500 hectares of prime farm land near Traveston Crossing on the Mary River.
One of the region's biggest dairy producers, John Cochrane, has just spent a million dollars upgrading his farm, which would end up 30 metres underwater.
