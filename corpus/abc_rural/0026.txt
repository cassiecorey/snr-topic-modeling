Low prices, falling demand slow down wheat exports
Wheat exports have slowed due to low prices and falling demand from Australia's traditional markets.
Despite some sales to Egypt, other markets including Iraq, Pakistan, China and India have failed to deliver the expected number of contracts.
With the second largest global crop on record, competition for tenders is particularly fierce.
Grains trader Lloyd George says there are a range of factors for the slow-down.
"Certainly Iraq has been an important customer of Australia's over a period of time, put in pretty significant tonnages and over the recent months AWB hasn't been exporting the quantities we have in the past," he said.
"But there's a whole bunch of broader issues out there as well. A lot of the markets whereby Australia would hope to sell the quantity of the harvest into are the same markets that are quiet this year."
