Cane toads helping to reduce feral pigs, insect numbers
Pest animals are having a field day on some farms in the Northern Territory.
South of Darwin, at Batchelor, one farm is losing at least three tonnes of premium champagne melons a year to dingoes.
But fruit grower David Thompson says the arrival of cane toads has reduced feral pig numbers and insect problems.
"It's a godsend to us in a way because we get a lot of the insects in the garden, because they got a really long tongue on them and they seem to never miss," he said.
"When they whip their tongue out they got the insect, that's it. Mainly moths, they will eat crickets and things like that as well.
