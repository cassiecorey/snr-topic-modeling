Quarantine boost following marine pest find
The increased threat of an exotic marine pest has prompted Northern Territory authorities to strengthen offshore quarantine measures.
The black-striped mussel has been found twice in the past week on seized illegal fishing vessels inside Darwin Harbour.
The pest was found after the boats were moored.
Territory Fisheries spokesman Peter Zeroni says quarantine checks will now be done five nautical miles offshore.
"As a result of events that occurred last week, we have made a decision as an interim measure to now inspect all vessels out at the five nautical mile buoy in open water, where the risk is less," he said.
"The risk at 1.5 is low due to it being an open-water environment ... however, as a precautionary measure we have moved the boats now further out.
"From an NT Fisheries perspective, the risk is manageable where they are. We are concerned about the NT's internal waters, waters within three nautical miles and probably out to 10.
"We have a strong interest in ensuring those waters are free of aquatic pests."
