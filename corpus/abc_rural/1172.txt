Tax review hits agribusiness shares
Nervous investors have wiped up to 25 per cent off the value of a number of companies involved in agribusiness managed investment schemes.
Companies including Great Southern, Timbercorp and Wilmott Forests have been hit in recent weeks.
Investment analyst Steve Johnson says some of the uncertainty is being caused by a federal review of the tax incentives offered for the schemes, which include timber, grapes, almonds and olives.
"Most other businesses certainly aren't as volatile as this, it would be a 25 per cent fall, I would say, in the last 3 weeks," he said.
