Business sector blames governments for water crisis
The Australian business sector has criticised the state and federal governments for not doing enough to solve the nation's water woes.
The Business Council of Australia has released a paper which criticises the time it is taking to implement the National Water Initiative, to establish a national water trading system.
Director of policy Maria Tarrant says delays are costing the Australian economy billions of dollars.
"The Business Council's report really identifies that Australia's water supply system is broken and needs to be fixed," she said.
