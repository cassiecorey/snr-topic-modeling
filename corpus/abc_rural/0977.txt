Cattle killers thought highly organised
Police in Western Australia suspect there may be an organised network killing pastoral cattle to sell their meat.
Seven cows have been reported butchered on Pilbara stations in the past month, and police believe there may be more which have not been reported.
Pastoralist Richard Climas, from Mardie Station 150 kilometres west of Karratha, says cattle theft is becoming a regular occurrence.
"I've found a few carcasses, generally only the legs and hide left, and they've taken the whole lot," he said.
"It happens quite often. A good bull at the moment is probably worth $600, $700 a beast, it adds up pretty quick.
"What else are they doing while they're out there?
"If they're brazen enough to kill a beast what else are they going to be doing while they're out and about?
"We've had solar panels stolen and all sorts of stuff stolen."
Further north in the Kimberley, the state's stock squad says there has been significant cattle thefts over the past 12 months.
