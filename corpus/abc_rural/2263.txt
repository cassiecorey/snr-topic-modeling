Rain hampers blueberry harvest
Australia's major blueberry producing area on the north coast of New South Wales is battling the problem of too much rain during harvest.
Cool and wet conditions have interrupted picking and one producer says his crop is down 20 per cent on forecast production.
Ridley Bell from Mountain Blue Orchards near Lismore says fruit rot is a problem in the wet.
"We had one period there of nine days when we couldn't get in to pick because of rain and the fruit starts to go soft and you have a problem as to know whether to pick that fruit," he said.
