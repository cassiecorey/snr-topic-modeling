El Nino may be benefiting fishing, aquaculture
El Nino weather systems may have a bad name for bringing drought to Australia but they might bring benefits for fishing and aquaculture.
The interaction between weather systems and the ocean will soon be tracked more closely, with the installation of high-tech monitoring equipment along the Australian coast.
South Australian based oceanographer Dr John Middleton says the equipment will give a more accurate picture of the impact of El Nino systems on marine life.
"The research I've done to date suggests they can actually lead to more nutrients available to the food web and thus more productivity," he said.
