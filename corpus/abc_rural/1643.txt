Push for inland rail network gathers speed
The push for an inland rail network between Melbourne and Brisbane has gathered pace at a meeting at Parkes in central western New South Wales.
One hundred and fifty delegates from New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have pushed the Federal Government to decide on a route.
But the Government has given no financial commitment.
There is a mix of local government and private sector players discussing ways to make the rail route viable.
The delegates were addressed by the incoming Transport Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile.
Mr Vaile told the gathering very little freight is currently carried on rail.
He blamed the Sydney bottleneck and highlighted the need to develop an alternative system from Melbourne to Brisbane.
Mr Vaile did say it would take until 2019 to develop the inland rail route, even if planning started now.
He was however short on committing to Federal Government funding to the inland rail route between Melbourne and Brisbane.
