Minister launches wind farm discussion paper
The Federal Government is investigating a national code for wind farm developments, to try to stop conflict in rural communities.
The Government is embroiled in a legal stoush with Victoria, after overturning approval for a major new wind farm in Gippsland in order to save the endangered orange-bellied parrot.
Environment Minister Ian Campbell has launched a discussion paper on the proposed code, which he says may be the best way of resolving disputes.
