Drought impact
Meanwhile as the grain industry struggles to produce a winter cereal crop, new data shows the impact the drought has had on the value of agricultural commodities.
The Bureau of Statistics has released its farm commodity figures for 2004-05, which show a $1.4 billion fall in the value of agriculture.
Analyst Nigel Gibson says they show that a drop in production and prices for winter grains was a key contributor.
"The main cause of that was the drop in the value of crops, which fell by 13 per cent to $17.8 billion," he said.
