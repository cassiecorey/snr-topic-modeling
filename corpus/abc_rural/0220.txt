PM to give statement to AWB inquiry
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile is about to step into the witness box at the oil-for-food inquiry in Sydney.
His appearance comes as the Prime Minister, John Howard, confirmed he has been called on to provide a sworn statement to the inquiry.
Senior counsel assisting the inquiry John Agius told a packed hearing room, the Prime Minister will supply by 4pm tomorrow his confidential statement documenting when he first learned of irregular payments by AWB to the Iraqi regime.
This afternoon, Mr Vaile's examination will explore what and when the Trade Minister knew about money paid to the Iraqi Grains Board, the Jordanian trucking company Alia and secret cables advising of complaints by the US Wheat Associates about Australia's inflated wheat contracts with Iraq.
