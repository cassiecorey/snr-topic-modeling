Global demand boosts exports of dairy goats
Growing global demand for dairy products is helping to boost exports of Australian dairy goats.
Argentina and Mexico have been big buyers to expand their local goat milk industries.
Now demand is emerging from Asia, Yemen and Papua New Guinea.
Jane Hewlett from Tasmania's Dairy Goat Society says there is a growing acceptance of dairy foods, particularly in Taiwan and China.
"Originally dairy products were not high on their list of food," she said.
