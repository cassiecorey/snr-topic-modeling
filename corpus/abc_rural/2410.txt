AT ONE WITH TUNA IN BRINE
Forget swimming with the dolphins. Tourists can now swim with the most valuable fish in the sea - tuna.

"I've seen them sit behind a boat at 10 to 12 knots, sort of 15 to 20 kilometres an hour for up to half an hour. I've seen quick reflex speeds of probably 40 to 50 kilometres an hour.
"They travel all around Australia, around the world, and they return to the same places year after year.
