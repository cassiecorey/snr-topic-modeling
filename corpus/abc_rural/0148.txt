Salinity threatening Barossa Valley: expert
An Adelaide professor says one of Australia's most renowned grape growing regions could be infested with salt in 10 years.
A professor in meteorology at Flinders University, Peter Schwedtferger, says grape growers need to minimise irrigation in the Barossa Valley.
He says saline water is being piped from local reservoirs, which is already causing problems.
"If the Barossa is over irrigated with this relatively saline water that's currently being used, the Barossa's life is going to be limited," he said.
"Once the really serious saline infestation occurs it's going to be too late."
But one of the Barossa's biggest grape growers, Ed Schild, says salinity is not a problem and estimates only half a hectare is affected by salt.
