New tree plantings fail to secure farm biodiversity: research
New research says offsetting the clearing of native vegetation with new tree plantings is not an effective way to maintain biodiversity on farms.
The Australian National University research suggests it takes up to 300 years for newly-planted vegetation to provide the same food and shelter to animals and birds.
Ecology Professor David Lindenmayer says the findings show a need to preserve remnant vegetation.
"We've found this from our data on the south-west slopes of New South Wales and it's for reptiles, it's for possums and gilders, arboreal marsupials and also for birds," he said.
