Company seeks new growers to help meet demand
A major Victorian company hopes to produce an extra million kilograms of fresh snow peas each year by recruiting new growers in south-east Queensland.
The company, Select Produce, says it has been lured by water security and the favourable climate in the Bundaberg/Childers salad bowl.
The business supplies the two major supermarket chains, with most of its produce coming from Victoria.
But Queensland manager Lyle Wyatt says the company is recruiting growers in the Wide Bay area to help it meet demand all year round.
