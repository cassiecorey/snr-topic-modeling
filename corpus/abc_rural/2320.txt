Tas bushfire damage 'severe'
Houses, pasture and fencing have been destroyed in a 10,000 hectare fire on Tasmania's north-east coast.
An assessment of damage is expected later today but at least 18 houses have been destroyed in the town of Scamander.
Local vet Tim McManus says the extent of stock losses is not yet known but at least one farm has suffered extensively.
"Glencoe around us had very severe fire damage, many of their paddocks are burnt and even now some of the bushland around them is still burning," he said.
