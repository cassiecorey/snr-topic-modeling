Eco City Farm wins invention of year award
An urban food production system designed to reduce carbon emissions has won an invention of the year award in northern New South Wales.
The Eco City Farm, which is on a standard house block, produces enough fish and vegetables to feed 300 families.
The farm is designed to cut the emissions created by transporting food from rural areas to city consumers.
Spokesman Andrew Bodlovich says it produces no effluent, recycles its own water and is economically viable even at current city land values.
"We really started out with the specific goal of achieving a triple bottom line with an agriculture system, so it really needed to work for profit but we also wanted it to be very ecological and it had to work for people as well," he said.
