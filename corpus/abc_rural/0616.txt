Merger could have dire consequences for Nationals: analyst
An expert on rural politics says the in-principle merger agreement between the Queensland Liberal and National parties is a disaster for the federal Nationals.
The agreement stems from months of talks between the Queensland conservatives parties on how best to beat Labor Premier Peter Beattie.
But political analyst Professor Brian Costar from Swinburne University says a merger even at a state level would have dire consequences for the Nationals in Queensland and federally.
He says a merger could cut the Nationals representation in the federal ministry and reduce the vote of both parities, leading to the rebirth of a 'One Nation style' party.
"Some of the issues that gave rise to One Nation, and particularly in Queensland where it was strongest, are still bubbling along below the surface," he said.
Federal party leader Mark Vaile has distanced the Nationals from a federal merger saying there has never been a better time for regional areas to have a specific rural conservative party.
In Queensland, the merger proposal has received a mixed response.
Just 18 months ago it was rejected out of hand, but today it is seen as the only way to ultimately topple Labor.
Lecturer in politics at Brisbane's Griffith University Paul Williams says farmers could be the ultimate losers.
"I think that they potentially have a lot to lose," he said.
"One can suspect that over time that the Nationals' voice will be drowned out.
