Dairy farmers needed for Tasmania
Tasmania's dairy industry has launched a recruitment drive to attract more farmers.
The campaign has the theme "a great place to live, a great place to dairy", and promotes not only the sound economics of dairy farming, but the lifestyle qualities of living in Tasmania.
Dairy consultant Basil Doonan says while there has been a big influx of New Zealand farmers in the past decade, this campaign targets Europeans.
"We don't mind where the investment comes from, we just need foreign investment, we need an injection of capital at the farm level in the Tasmanian industry," he said.
