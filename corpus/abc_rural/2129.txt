Farmers march on Vic Parliament
Farmers have rallied in Melbourne today to raise awareness of rural issues in the final week of the Victorian state election.
Farmers on horseback and on tractors have been part of a procession through the central business district to Parliament House.
Goulburn Valley farmer Col Grinter says he is marching over having to pay for irrigation water he will not receive this season.
"If the Government is fair dinkum about helping us, well the first thing they can do is pay for any water that we're not going to get, you know for a farmer to be lumbered with a $20,000 water bill for example and not get any production out of it it makes it pretty darn hard," Mr Grinter said.
