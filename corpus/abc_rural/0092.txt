Falling Aust dollar good news for farmers
In some good news for farmers, the falling Australian dollar is adding hundreds of millions of dollars to export returns.
Chief economist at Deutsche Bank Tony Meer says the dollar is at its lowest level in 18 months, trading at 71.5 US cents.
He says the drop is boosting returns in the resources sector and there are also benefits for farm commodities.
"Definitely anyone who gets to export, I am thinking resource companies but also the farm sector and the good news for the farm sector is that those broad acre croppers, those people who produce things like wheat and barley, at least they have got something to sell on those global markets this time around because of the breaking of the drought," he said.
