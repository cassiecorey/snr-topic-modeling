Centenarian maintains enthusiasm for farm life
She may be about to celebrate her 100th birthday but the Hunter Valley's Harriet Madden has not lost her enthusiasm for farm life.
For most of her life, Mrs Madden has been a dairy farmer with her late brother Len.
Despite enduring tough times and drought, Mrs Madden says she is now enviously eyeing off a farm that is for sale next door.
