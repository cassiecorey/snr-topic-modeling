High rabbit numbers worry graziers
Graziers are concerned that high rabbit numbers will hinder the recovery of pastoral country after the drought.
David Lord of Thackaringa station near Broken Hill says he is concerned that the calicivirus is losing its impact in controlling rabbit populations.
Mr Lord is calling for a complete stocktake of what is going on with rabbits and control methods.
"General talk around the bush [is] that rabbit numbers increased over the last six months," he said.
"Definitely need some finance to support a scientific team to get a good handle on RHD so we know whether any resistance is developing.
