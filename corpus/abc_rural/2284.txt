US beef industry suspicious about bone chips find
The US Agriculture Department wants to examine bone chips that South Korea claims it found in two rejected shipments of American beef.
The US industry is suspicious about where the fragments came from.
US beef industry sources argue the tiny bones the Koreans claim they found, which caused them to reject the US shipments, may not have been from animals the same age as the beef.
United States Department of Agriculture Deputy Under-Secretary Chuck Lambert is not ignoring the possibility that the shipments may have been tampered with.
"We've asked to have the bone chips returned, some people have suggested DNA sampling or other means of trying to determine the origin of those bone chips," he said.
The latest suspicions threaten to raise the US-Korea beef dispute to a new level after Korea earlier this year agreed to reopen its market following a 2003 US mad cow case.
