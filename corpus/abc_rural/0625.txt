NFF concerned about Snowy Hydro privatisation
Opposition to the privatisation of Snowy Hydro continues to build.
The nation's chief rural lobby group has, for the first time, expressed serious concerns about the sale and its effect on the National Water Initiative.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) fears little regard will be given to farmers who rely on Snowy Hydro's water if the scheme is sold-off.
And NFF president Peter Corish says funds from any privatisation should be used to protect the environment, irrigators and affected river communities.
He has also called for tighter regulation of Snowy investors, including a permanent 10 per cent cap on ownership of Snowy shares.
"We want to ensure private ownership of the water behind a dam wall, which is something that is certainly new, it's a new principle for us in Australia that doesn't negatively impact on the people who benefit from that water currently," he said.
The three federal independents will table a motion in Parliament today, calling for the sale to be blocked entirely.
And Nationals MP Kay Hull plans to introduce a private member's bill into Federal Parliament to permanently cap individual shareholdings in Snowy Hydro to 10 per cent.
The legislation would also stipulate that the majority of directors be Australian and that the head office remains in this country.
Mrs Hull opposes the sale, but says, as a last resort, this bill would limit foreign ownership.
"I will continue to fight the sale, this is a safety net in the event the sale can not be ceased," she said.
"I want to ensure that enshrined in legislation is all of the safeguards that need to take place to ensure that big companies and overseas companies can't come in and buy up the Snowy."
It is unclear whether the private member's bill will receive the support of the Government or the Opposition.
