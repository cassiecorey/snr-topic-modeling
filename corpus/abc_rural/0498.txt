WA farmers unhappy with state Budget
The Western Australian Government has handed down its budget, but it has failed to excite the agricultural sector.
The Government has confirmed a surplus of $2 billion for this financial year, with the windfall to pay for the Perth to Mandurah railway.
Trevor de Landgraft from the WA Farmers Federation says rural people have been ignored.
