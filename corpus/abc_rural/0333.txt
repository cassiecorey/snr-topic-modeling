Citrus company blocks canker surveillance officials
One of Australia's major citrus growing companies has closed its gates to Queensland's citrus canker surveillance authorities.
The discovery of canker at Emerald in 2004 decimated the local industry, with the destruction of tens of thousands of fruit trees.
2PH Farms says the blockade is to support local orchardist Maurie Iddles, who missed out on financial assistance in the wake of the outbreak.
Craig Pressler of 2PH says it was not an easy choice, with both farmers risking their plans to replant orchards next year.
"Well the decision wasn't taken lightly," he said.
"We wish to support Maurie and Connie in their fight for fair and equitable treatment with regards to compensation.
