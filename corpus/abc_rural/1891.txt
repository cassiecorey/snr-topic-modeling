Graincorp to ship wheat to eastern states
Graincorp is preparing to ship 1 million tonnes of wheat from Western Australia to the eastern states, as harvests fail in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.
The bulk handler will require approval from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to convert export terminals on the eastern seaboard to import terminals to receive the grain.
Graincorp's Sam Tainsh says the grain will be transported by rail as well as sea.
"Graincorp is making a number of inland depots available for large volume rail discharge," he said.
