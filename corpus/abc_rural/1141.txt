US lamb market set to slow down
There is a warning for lamb producers today that growth in the US market is set to slow down over the next year.
Sales of our lamb to the US grew by 28 per cent between 2004 and 2005 to become Australia's highest value market worth $327 million.
But Shane O'Hara from the Australian Lamb Company says exports are under pressure from similar factors to here, like competition from cheaper meats like chicken.
"We've seen some higher fuel costs, that's having a big pinch on disposable income," he said.
