Fruit, veg code of conduct plans revealed
The Federal Government has unveiled plans for a voluntary code of conduct for the fruit and vegetable industry.
Growers wanted a mandatory code, which was originally promised by the Government before the last election.
The Government says the new code will be legally enforceable, and provide transparency to growers.
But John Roach from grower group Ausveg, is disappointed.
"I think the underpinning side of all this is good business practice and one of the things about the mandatory code, as originally proposed, was that it would be about good business practice," he said.
"Any watering down of that is a concern, however if this is the way forward then we give it a damn good shot, as an outcome, hopefully other people will bring the same goodwill to the table."
Growers and wholesalers will meet later this week to begin work on the code, with a draft expected by November.
But Federal Industry Minister, Ian Macfarlane, says a mandatory code would have been too onerous.
