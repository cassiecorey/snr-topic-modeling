Group hits out at inequality between urban, rural training facilities
The body which represents TAFEs says inequality between urban and rural training facilities is contributing to rural skills shortages.
It wants the federal and state governments to consider proposals including more cooperation between urban and rural TAFEs, setting up specialist technical schools for year 11 and 12 students and establishing a new trade diploma.
Martin Riordan, from TAFE Directors Australia, says student numbers have fallen by 67,000 in the past five years and country institutes in particular are not attractive enough.
"There is massive discrimination within the system against rural and regional [areas]," he said.
