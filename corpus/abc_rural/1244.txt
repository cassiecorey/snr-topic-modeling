Lack of feed causing sheep to suffer: RSPCA
The RSPCA is cracking down on farmers in WA, saying sheep are suffering due to a lack of feed.
Officers have visited more than 50 farms in the driest parts of the state.
Spokeswoman Emma-Jane Morcombe says the organisation wants to help farmers to find enough feed so their livestock can get through the tough season.
"You can call the RSPCA because we will come in and, as I said, we're giving advice right now," she said.
