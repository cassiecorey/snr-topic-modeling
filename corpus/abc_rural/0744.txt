Cool dry season could mean early Top End mangoes
Cooler than average weather this dry season in the Northern Territory could bring forward the mango harvest.
Night time temperatures across the Darwin rural area have been more than three degrees cooler than average this month.
Flowering is under way across mango orchards of the Top End and extension officer Greg Owens says fruit could mature by mid September.
"The trees were pretty much set up for it from a very small harvest season last year," he said.
"They had good reserves from the tree and having that cold snap follow on from that rain seems to have triggered a lot of trees that were ready to go off.
