Vaile leaves door ajar for Katter
Leader of the National Party Mark Vaile says he would push for another ministry position if Queensland Independent Bob Katter rejoined the party.
There is speculation Mr Katter will seek membership of the Nationals, after contesting the last election in his seat of Kennedy as an Independent.
The Nationals lost a ministry position earlier this year when Senator Julian McGauran crossed to the Liberal Party.
Mr Vaile has told the Nine Network he is keeping an open mind about Mr Katter.
"Politics is about numbers and if someone wants to commit to the ideals and the philosophies of our particular party or our government then they're most welcome, so I'd keep an open mind on that particular matter," he said.
