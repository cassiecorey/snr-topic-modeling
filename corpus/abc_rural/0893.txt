Green light given to abalone farm
The first land-based abalone farm in New South Wales has been approved on the state's mid-north coast.
Native abalone is under threat from poaching and aquaculture is seen as a way of preserving numbers.
But local conservation groups fear the development could pollute coastal waters and destroy seagrass beds.
Graham Housefield from Australian Bounty Seafoods says he has done everything he can to deal with the concerns.
"I guess what it really comes down to is that the farm needs to have a pristine area because we need water that's as clean as possible and therefore we can't afford to do anything to harm the water from that area," he said.
"These animals are absolutely and totally reliant on having clean water."
