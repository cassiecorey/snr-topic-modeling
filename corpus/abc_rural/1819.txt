Locust spraying under way
The WA Department of Agriculture and Food will start spraying for locusts today.
Numbers are said to be some of the worst on record and the locusts are getting stuck into what little feed and crops are around in this dry season.
Department crews, along with farmers, have been surveying farms for some months now and have detected target zones that will be controlled before locusts swarm.
