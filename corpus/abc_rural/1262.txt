Tassie camembert takes out world cheese award
A Tasmanian camembert has beaten the country that invented it at a world cheese show in the United States.
The winning sample from the National Foods' cheese factory in Burnie was up against 100 entries from all over the world, including the best from France.
Chuffed cheese maker Kurt Wyss says the Tasmanian Heritage Signature Camembert is unlike any other in the world.
"It really stands out compared to other camemberts as the flavour is a more fuller, earthier and a really, really creamy texture," he said.
