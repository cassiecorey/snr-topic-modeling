WA pushes for federal drought relief funds
The West Australian Government will apply for exceptional circumstances (EC) relief for some of the state's worst drought-affected regions.
It is in negotiations with the Federal Government to roll over an existing EC claim in the northern agricultural region but extend it further into the central wheatbelt.
Dexter Davies, from the Dry Season Advisory Committee, says parts of the state are the worst he has seen anywhere in Australia.
"It's the driest start in history," he said.
"In the northern areas ... all chances are gone.
"Mullewa, Morowa, through there, it simply hasn't rained and that goes right out to the coast to Northampton - up there they just simply haven't had a winter at all.
