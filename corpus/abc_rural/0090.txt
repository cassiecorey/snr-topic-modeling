Moody's review pushes up AWB shares
Shares in wheat exporter AWB have surged more than 20 cents after a positive review from ratings agency Moody's.
The share price has hovered at all-time lows in recent weeks but Moody's assessment of subsidiary company AWB Harvest Finance has improved confidence in AWB's ability to handle risk.
Senior financial analyst at CommSec Grant Saligari says while it is an important review, it is expected the share price will continue to fluctuate.
"I think this is more a reaffirmation of short-term prospects at this stage," he said.
"I think you're going to see quite a bit of volatility until the outcome of the Cole inquiry is known and the Government's response to that is known."
Shares opened trading this morning at $3.97.
Meanwhile 220 grain growers have voiced their support for the single desk for wheat exports at a meeting in WA's mid-west.
Just six farmers at the gathering in Morowa wanted the single desk deregulated.
Many believe their support is not being recognised in the eastern states but David Hayes of Badgingarra says WA growers want the single desk left alone.
"I think there's a clear demonstration that Western Australian farmers are 100 per cent behind single desk," he said.
They have done the wrong thing and I think that there's going to have to be some heads roll in the AWB but at the end of the day, the rank and file of the people that work for the AWB are great people and they've got our best interests at heart."
