Cattle producers urged to audit livestock records
The Australian Beef Association (ABA) wants cattle producers to audit their livestock records listed on the database of the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS).
The system, which is designed to track every animal through electronic ear tags in case of a disease outbreak, has been heavily criticised by the breakaway group.
New president Brad Bellinger from New South Wales says the ABA's own research shows only 30 per cent of NLIS producer records are accurate.
"Now their own audit is the matter of matching what their actual property sales are to what is actually registered on the NLIS database account," Mr Bellinger said.
"We want to point out to the regulators and the Minister how bad the situation, how inaccurate the NLIS system is."
The Federal Government has commissioned an official audit of the database.
Meanwhile the peak national body, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), is calling for unity within the cattle industry.
The ABA boycotted MLA's annual general meeting in Adelaide yesterday and staged a rally in Queensland.
MLA chairman Don Heatley says cattle producers need to resolve NLIS issues by working together.
"Yes, there is criticism, and I don't resile from the criticism," he said.
"At the end of the day we've developed a new system and NLIS is new and it's not perfect at this stage but we will continue to work on it.
