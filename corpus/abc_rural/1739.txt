Beefed up prices recorded at Rockhampton bull sale
Australia's biggest bull sale has attracted record prices and a clearance rate of 98 per cent.
The sale at Rockhampton, in central Queensland, finished last night, with more than 1,000 bulls fetching nearly $6.5 million over three days.
The top sale of $90,000 was paid for both a grey and a red brahman bull.
John Croaker from the Australian Brahman Breeders Association says it is the result of years of work.
"They have certainly invested in the breeding herd and the genetics that they are using and it is certainly paying off," he said.
