Roma saleyard replaces stock ID equipment
Australia's biggest saleyard is changing its national livestock identification equipment but management denies that is because it is not efficient.
Run-through scanners were introduced at Roma in southern Queensland in July last year, to comply with the new animal traceback laws.
Since there there have been complaints of time delays and ongoing debate over whether the equipment or the agents are to blame.
Rob Loughnan, from the saleyard's board, says delays are an issue.
But he says the main reason for the change is because the system cannot easily separate an individual beat from a herd.
"The market research is telling us that very soon the buyers will be wanting to know if there is an animal in a particular pen that is not lifetime traceable and that's not going to suit their requirements and that's going to have to be highlighted," he said.
