US blames Europe for collapse of trade talks
The blame game has started following the collapse of the Doha world trade talks.
Key nations have failed to agree on how to cut farm and industrial tariffs, and US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns is blaming Europe's refusal to let more beef in.
But Andrew McCallum from Meat and Livestock Australia says the trade talks did not detail individual agricultural products.
"I think what Johanns has done has just highlighted the beef issue as an example," he said.
