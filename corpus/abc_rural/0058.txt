Farmers shouldering vegetation cost, says McGauran
The Federal Agriculture Minister has told a national conference that farmers are bearing too much of the cost of conserving native vegetation.
The Vegetation Futures Conference at Albury in southern New South Wales is looking at how to balance conservation with production on farmland.
More than 400 scientists, government representatives and land managers are attending the four-day conference.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran threw the cat amongst the pigeons in his opening address, saying that some state legislation is too focused on protection, sacrificing farm production.
He has announced funding of $2 million over the next two years for pilot projects to develop more flexible approaches to managing native vegetation.
The project will look at things like incentive payments and offsets.
He has also launched a comprehensive database containing information about Australia's native vegetation.
Meanwhile Mr McGauran has rejected suggestions the Government could buy water from irrigators to improve the health of the Murray River.
Parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has floated the idea to meet the targets of the Living Murray program, because not enough water savings have been found.
But Mr McGauran says it is too early to talk about entering the water market.
