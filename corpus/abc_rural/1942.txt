Fishing industry wants govt help to keep businesses afloat
The fishing industry is trying to adapt to the recent Federal Government buyback of 400 fishing licences.
The buyback has led to a 70 per cent drop in fish being supplied to the Twofold fishing co-operative at Eden on the south coast of New South Wales.
But chairman Fritz Drenkhahn says members are chasing federal assistance to keep the business afloat.
"The decision of the members was yes to go ahead to strive in all directions to maintain it open [but] a lot hinges on the business assistance package which we'll be applying for," he said.
