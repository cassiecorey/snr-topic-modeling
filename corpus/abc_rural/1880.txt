Climate Institute urges more action on greenhouse emissions
The farmer-funded Climate Institute has launched a national advertising campaign, calling on the Federal Government to do more to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.
The organisation says the drought has been intensified by climate change and a national carbon trading scheme and increased mandatory renewable energy use targets are needed.
In his weekly online radio message the Prime Minister, John Howard, says the Government is spending $2 billion on reducing climate change.
But the Climate Institute's founder, beef and sheep farmer Mark Wootton, says these measures are not working because greenhouse emissions are increasing.
"Under what is put forward at the moment our greenhouse, the Australian government's current policies, increased emissions by 10 per cent over the last decade and it will increase them by a further 17 per cent by 2020 unless we change what we are doing," Mr Wootton said.
