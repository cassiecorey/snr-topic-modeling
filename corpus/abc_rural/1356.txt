Harvey Beef moves to lot-fed cattle
Western Australia's biggest beef processor is moving away from its traditional grass-fed cattle supplies.
EG Green and Sons was forced into administration last year.
The new owner is now trying to make the abattoir more efficient by focussing on lot-fed cattle.
Harvey Beef's chief executive Scott Henderson says it will be some time before the abattoir is running at full capacity.
He says it is unlikely that stock prices will match the eastern states in the short-term.
"The most important thing for us is to cut costs wherever we can and that's what we are doing to make sure that we have profitable business here," Mr Henderson said.
