Long range forecasters look to autumn rainfall
The Bureau of Meteorology and other long range weather forecasters are predicting a better outlook for drought-hit areas by autumn next year.
But there is still some debate about how much better.
Most long range forecasters agree it is not yet an exact science and they are using different systems.
But David Stephens from the WA Department of Agriculture is predicting an 80 per cent chance of a good autumn break.
In Victoria, independent forecaster John Moore says there is 90 per cent chance of an average year starting with heavy falls in February or March.
Queensland Sunspot observer Owen Beneict expects the dry to continue.
