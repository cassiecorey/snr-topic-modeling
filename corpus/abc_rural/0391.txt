Wet season takes its toll on live cattle exports
The Northern Territory's protracted wet season is having a lasting impact on live cattle exports to South-East Asia.
Feedlots in Australia's largest market, Indonesia, are less than half-full, with another 50,000 cattle needed.
Stuart Kenny from the Territory Cattlemen's Association says cattle prices in Indonesia have gone up but that has not slowed demand.
"There has been more price rises over the last couple of weeks but our visitors are saying that the prices did not detract from the supply and that's a good sign," he said.
"I think the Indonesian economy is certainly sort of holding its own and we certainly look forward to seeing a good cattle season ahead for the NT cattle industry.
