Athletic mare takes out campdraft comp
An athletic mare called Roanys Chex, ridden by central Queenslander Pete Comiskey, has taken out Australia's richest campdraft at Rockhampton.
Record numbers of riders competed over the weekend in front of what organisers say was its biggest ever crowd.
Mr Comiskey says his $20,000 share of the prizemoney will come in handy.
"Most certainly there's always plenty of costs in campdrafting," he said.
"It's always a great honour to win the big one and this mare has been very successful for us, to win the clock last year and the Gold cup, and we're very lucky to have her on the truck."
