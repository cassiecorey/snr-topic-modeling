McGuigan vineyard plans concern SA grape growers
Grape growers in South Australia's Riverland are concerned about plans by McGuigan Simeon Wines to develop a 400-hectare vineyard.
The company wants vines at Wentworth, in south-western New South Wales to be in full production by 2009-2010.
The news comes just days after 160 growers were told their contracts with the winery will remain suspended for next harvest.
Chris Byrne from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association says the type of development is detrimental to the whole industry.
"We have made the point that unless the industry with their help gets right behind the sort of strategic planning that we are encouraging and does something as an industry about rationalising, restructuring and supporting the growers that have built the industry, then that whole proposal is really counter productive to our interests," he said.
There was a 10 per cent jump in the amount of wine exported from Australia in the 12 months to the end of May, to a record 726 million litres.
The Wine and Brandy Corporation says the value of exports grew slightly to almost $2.8 billion, despite prices dropping 34 cents per litre.
