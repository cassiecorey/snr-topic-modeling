AAC grazing plan proves successful: manager
The nation's largest pastoral house has proved you can graze cattle productively in the outback without fences.
The Australian Agricultural Company (AAC) is using water and herding to control grazing across 500 square kilometres.
Rockhampton Downs manager Ben Wratten says it has taken two years to change the habits of cattle and so reduce overgrazing.
"We rotate them and alternate them from watering points by shutting off the ones we do not want them to drink at," he said.
"We have got hard evidence now that it has definitely made a difference in the recovery of our pasture and we have full crowns of mitchell grass within 200 metres of the trough.
"The cattle are burning a lot less energy to access good bulk feed.
