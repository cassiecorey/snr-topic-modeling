Cities urged to consider buying water from irrigators
A report commissioned by the Federal Government says cities will need to consider buying water from irrigators to address major urban shortages.
Report author John Marsden says buying water from irrigators is a possibility for Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Canberra.
He says communities must consider the option.
"In general there's been a reluctance by governments to put this issue firmly on the table because of fear of upsetting rural electorates," he said.
"But of course, the rural waterholders trade water all the time, between themselves and there's no reason why the trade can't be with other parties, including with the cities."
Meanwhile the National Water Commission has confirmed it is conducting a feasibility study into piping water from so-called "water rich" areas of northern New South Wales, to drought-affected south-east Queensland.
The study, which will go to the Federal Government, is looking at rivers including the Wilson, Brunswick, Richmond, Tweed and Clarence.
Although the region has high rainfall, Wayne Franklin from Rous Water says there is not enough water to pipe across the border.
"When you look at the Clarence and the Clarence is the one below us so we're centred on the Richmond Valley," he said.
"If you look at either of our valleys and the amount of water we have we're really small fry compared to Queensland.
