Retiring wine group head predicts industry turnaround
The retiring chairman of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation is predicting a turnaround in the wine industry within the next four years.
David Brownhill steps down today after six years in his government-appointed role.
With grape growers struggling with poor prices and an oversupply, Mr Brownhill does not, however, expect much improvement in the short term.
"I believe in two years' time the light will start to shine at the end of the tunnel, [it] doesn't mean that it's coming out of the tunnel in two years' time, but in four years' time I believe that you'll be right out of the tunnel and then you'll most probably find we'll be a little bit short of red wine for example," he said.
