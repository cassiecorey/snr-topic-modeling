New food labelling laws cover Internet shopping: FSANZ
Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) says Internet grocery sales are covered by new country of origin labelling laws.
Horticulturists had raised concerns that the labelling laws introduced in June had failed to include the rapidly growing online market.
At the time, the nation's food regulator said it would call for industry input to fix the problem.
