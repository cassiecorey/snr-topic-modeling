Fines for minor breaches may exacerbate driver shortage problem
Livestock transport operators are concerned that new fatigue management measures proposed by the National Transport Commission could force drivers out of the industry.
The commission's proposal to improve driver fatigue suggests a demerit system for log book offences, the same system used for general traffic offences.
Ross Fraser from Frasers Transport in Queensland says while road safety is paramount, the shortage of drivers will get worse if they start being fined for minor breaches.
"We're really concerned about it because we're getting drivers who are at the moment being fined for 15 minutes over in their log book - 15 minutes over a driving period that may have happened three weeks ago," he said.
