Winter crop harvest down 60pc: ABARE
The latest predictions from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) show the nation's winter crop harvest is 60 per cent down on last year.
With the driest August to October period since 1900, ABARE is also warning summer plantings will suffer, particularly rice and cotton.
Chief commodity analyst Dr Terry Sheals says any grain and fodder stocks held on farm will become increasingly important.
"I would expect the winter grains harvest, a lot of that harvest will be held on farms in those areas worst affected by the drought," he said.
"The report confirms the seriousness of the situation.
"We are looking at the lowest winter grains crop in 10 years, since the 1994-95 drought to be precise.
"The crop's estimated to be about 15.5 million tonnes."
Meanwhile as expected, drought conditions have intensified across eastern and southern Australia.
The National Climate Centre says there has been a distinct turn for the worse since August, due to the lack of late winter and spring rains.
