Wage increase causes concern
Agricultural employers are voicing their concern about the Australian Fair Pay Commission's wage increase to low-paid workers.
The commission yesterday granted workers on less than $700 a week an extra $27.36 in their pay packet.
The National Farmers Federation says it is disappointed with the decision.
And Michael Badcock, from grower group AUSVEG, says the increase will make it harder for Australia to compete with imported fruit and vegetables.
"It's going to put vegetable farmers in Australia in a very bad position," he said.
"We've got a lot of pressures with cheaper imports coming into Australia and now all of a sudden we've got to pay this extra increase in wages.
"It's going to make it very difficult for us to compete in the global market."
The Australian Workers Union, which represents many low-paid employees in agriculture, says the increase is good but could have been better.
Organiser Terry O'Connor admits he was pleasantly surprised by the decision.
