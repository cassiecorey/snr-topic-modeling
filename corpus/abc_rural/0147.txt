Levy to pay for rail upgrade angers grain growers
Farmers on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula are angry at a proposed grain levy to pay for a regional rail upgrade.
Up to $40 million will be spent upgrading road and rail, and farmers are being asked to contribute $2 million.
The Regional Development Board says dollar-for-dollar federal funding could be jeopardised if farmers do not support the 50 cent per tonne levy.
While there has been some support, most attending a grain grower forum at Cummins objected to it.
"I just think we're being conned," one farmer said.
"The buck stops at the farmer's gate and we're regarded as a bit of a cash cow.
"Everytime they want money they seem to think 'oh well we'll just whack a levy on for a while'."
