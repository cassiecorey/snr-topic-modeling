Rural health professions hail agreement
Rural health professionals say a new agreement between the states and the Federal Government will go a long way towards fixing the shortage of doctors in country areas.
An extra 200 medical school places, funding for rural medical schools and a new system of training that includes stints in regional areas are just some of the proposals put forward.
Rural medicine will be recognised in its own right and there will be a national action plan for mental health.
Head of Melbourne University's rural medical school, Dawn deWitt, says while getting extra student places is a great achievement the hard work now is getting the teachers.
"How we are going to work through this issue of asking an already short workforce to teach a huge number of additional new students is going to be the trick," she said.
The Rural Doctors Association says it is not clear how many of the new medical school places will be bonded but it hopes they will include living allowances and other incentives.
