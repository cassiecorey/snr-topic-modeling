WA farmers anxious for rain
Graingrowers in Western Australia are anxiously waiting for some substantial rainfall to come out of a cold front expected to pass through in the next two days.
Along with many farmers in the east, growing in the northern agricultural regions have been dry sowing since March and are now starting to worry about the impact of the ongoing dry.
CSIRO plant scientist John Passioura says farmers underestimate how strong seeds really are.
"If you have a false start and you get a bit of rain and the seed starts to swell up and so and it's done all of the getting the machinery ready to go, the biochemical machinery, then, it will skip that phase when you get the next good rain," he said.
