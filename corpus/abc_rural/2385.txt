Growers face pressure over wholesaler contracts
A Queensland horticulture group says growers have been pressured into signing contracts by wholesalers trying to avoid the industry's new code of conduct.
All contracts signed on or after last Friday are subject to the code, which is designed to improve transparency.
Growcom spokesman Jan Davis says some growers had to sign contracts before Friday, while others were asked to back-date agreements.
