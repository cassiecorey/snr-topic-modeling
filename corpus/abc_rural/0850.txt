Minister pushes deal with Gulf states
Although talks to set up a free trade deal with the United Arab Emirates have stalled, Trade Minister Mark Vaile says Australia should try to do a deal with all six nations of the Gulf Co-operation Council.
A spokesperson for the Minister says the Gulf states are an important and growing market for Australia, with exports of goods worth $4 billion in 2005.
The Gulf Council comprises the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
