Gold mine set to finally open
A massive new gold mine at Lake Cowal in central western New South Wales is finally opening today, 10 years after it was first proposed.
Environmental concerns kept the project on hold.
The owners and operators of the mine have had to overcome many hurdles to allow today's opening to take place.
Lake Cowal is the largest inland lake in the state, but is dry most of the time.
The mine development had been stopped several times over cyanide concerns, Aboriginal issues and the potential environmental impact.
The first gold pour took place in April of this year.
Canadian owner Barrick says 2,010 permanent staff are now employed.
