WA bananas sent east
A small number of Western Australian bananas have been sent to the eastern states after a sharp drop in demand.
After cyclone Larry destroyed the Queensland crop, WA growers vowed to stay loyal to their local customers.
But with bananas selling for about $6 a kilogram, shoppers decided to leave fruit on the shelf.
Kevin Leahy from Carnarvon's Sweeter Banana Co-operative says sending fruit east will not become a regular practice.
"A lot of bananas came in from Queensland that had come down obviously with the cyclone, they cleaned them up and sent them over and there was no demand," he said.
