Study to consider wine industry's future
Increased domestic and international competition has prompted a new study into the future direction of the wine industry.
The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the Winemakers Federation of Australia are conducting the state of the industry study, which is to be released next year.
But the report will not offer short-term solutions for growers unable to sell their grapes.
The federation's Dominic Nolan says it is to protect the long-term future of the wine industry, and is not a knee-jerk reaction to the grape glut.
"The decisions that we make about planting today really has an impact in five years' time or beyond," he said.
"What we're looking at is very much a strategic document, we're talking what's going to happen in the next 10 to 20 years.
