Toowoomba ratepayers to vote on drinking recycled water
As the water crisis in south-east Queensland continues, the ratepayers of Toowoomba will vote on whether they are prepared to drink recycled water.
Toowoomba Mayor Di Thorley says the referendum is the first of its type and is a condition of Commonwealth funding.
"It was not our idea I can assure you," she said.
