Pacific seasonal workers move criticised
A new report condemns the push to import workers from the Pacific to fill seasonal labour shortages.
The think tank Centre for Independent Studies says migration would delay the Pacific region's attempt to address its economic problems.
Instead it wants welfare changes, to encourage Aboriginals and the long-term unemployed into the workforce.
Milton James from Cape York Partnerships employs Aboriginal people from the region to pick fruit along the Murray River.
He supports the idea, but says it is not a quick fix solution.
