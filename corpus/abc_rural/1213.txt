Mining companies continue posting profits
Evidence of the resources boom continues to show-up on the financial markets, with record profits posted by Australian miners in the past 48 hours.
The biggest result came from Rio Tinto, which has posted a profit of just under $5 billion for the half year.
Rio produces iron ore, coal, diamonds, copper, alumina and uranium in mining operations around the country.
London resource expert Kevin Tomlinson says the success of Australia's resources sector, despite high labour and operational costs, has surprised world financial markets.
