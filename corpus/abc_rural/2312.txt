PGA to fight for farmers' water rights
The Western Australian Pastoralist and Graziers Association (PGA) says it will fight to maintain farmers' water rights after an Environmental Protection Authority report allowed 45 gigalitres of water to be transported to Perth from the southern Yarragadee aquifer.
The report, released late last week, says the Water Corporation can sustainably draw water from the aquifer without harming the environment.
But farmers are concerned their future water needs have been overlooked.
Water spokesman for the PGA, Dave Wren, says it is time Perth started developing its own water saving strategies.
"The National Water Initiative calls for each catchment to have a plan - Perth has not got a plan," he said.
"There's at least 112 gigalitres of water being pumped from domestic bores unlicensed and unmetered, there's recycling opportunities in Perth that have been identified.
