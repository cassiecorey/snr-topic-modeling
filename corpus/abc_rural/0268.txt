Search for grapevine genome moves a step closer
An Italian team of scientists has produced the world's first draft of the grapevine genome sequence.
The work, on the pinot noir variety, could lead to the development of high yielding, disease resistant grapes that still make good tasting wine.
Project leader with CSIRO Plant Industries, Doctor Mark Thomas, has been in close contact with the Italian team and says it is an important step towards the final grapevine gene map.
"Once the genome sequence is completed it will be the foundation I think for 21st century grape research as it will allow us to understand what genes are involved in grape quality and those genes that also control fruitfulness and yield," he said.
In Australia, the CSIRO has been working with a group in France trying to isolate the genes responsible for powdery mildew resistance and downey mildew resistance.
