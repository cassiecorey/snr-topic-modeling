Q-fever case prompts push to relocate abattoir
A push has begun to relocate a Victorian abattoir after links were made to four cases of the disease Q-fever.
The Wodonga meatworks is located within the Wodonga city boundary.
The local council has now announced a feasibility study into moving it to a location well away from populated areas.
Last month the Victorian Department of Human Services revealed four people in Wodonga had Q-fever.
It named one possible cause as dust from holding yards at the abattoir.
None had direct contact with livestock, the usual transmitter of the disease.
The meatworks is owned by Norvic Food Processing.
The company's general manager, John Hayes, acknowledged that eventually the abattoir will have to be relocated.
