Vic Govt considers renewable energy scheme
The Victorian Government is considering a mandatory renewable energy target to encourage wind farm expansion.
The Government says there is no other incentive to grow the renewable energy industry, because the Federal Government will not increase its targets.
Energy Minister Theo Theophanous says power companies will only buy more green energy if they have targets to meet.
"We are still not quite at 10 per cent renewable for the whole country and that's why we are currently looking at the question of whether Victoria should just develop its own renewable energy type scheme, similar to the national MRETS scheme," he said.
