Tractor drivers finish cross-country journey
A group of tractor drivers are toasting their success in crossing the continent in a series of veteran Chamberlains.
The members of the 9G Chamberlain Tractor Club have bumped along country roads all the way from Perth to the northern tip of Cape York.
They have been travelling at a top speed of 45 kilometres an hour.
Spokesman George Baldwin says they expect to raise $25,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and regional hospitals.
"Most of the people come from Western Australia," he said.
"They've journeyed through from Perth to Ayers Rock to Alice Springs to Mount Isa, Cloncurry to Weipa.
"Yesterday we went to the tip with 15 tractors and everyone cheered and had champagne and what not.
