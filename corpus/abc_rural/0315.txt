Stud owner 'optimistic' about online sale
Stud cattle are being sold exclusively on the Internet for the first time today.
Traditionally sales are conducted in person by agents with online selling offered as an additional feature.
Tanholm Limousin stud owner Kjedl Sorenson, from the Darling Downs in Queensland, says the sale has attracted interest from across Australia.
"I'm not nervous, but I'm curious to see how it goes," he said.
