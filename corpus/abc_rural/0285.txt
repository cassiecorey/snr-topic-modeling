Iraq finalises wheat purchase
The Iraqi Grains Board says it has finalised a $100 million wheat purchase from Australia after almost two months of negotiations.
Although the three companies selling the wheat say they have not yet signed a contract, the Grains Council of Australia believes terms have been agreed.
The head of the Iraq Grains Board Khalil Aassi has told reporters the country will buy 350,000 tonnes of wheat at $190 a tonne from the Wheat Australia consortium.
The deal was brokered by Trade Minister Mark Vaile, who visited Baghdad in February to save the Iraq wheat trade, after it announced it would no longer deal with monopoly exporter AWB because of the oil-for-food kickbacks scandal.
The deal with Wheat Australia, which includes ABB, GrainCorp and Cooperative Bulk Handling, breaks AWB's hold over wheat exports.
But the Grains Council's David Ginns says the deal will not be a lucrative one.
"As we know, time costs money and they certainly spent a lot of time and money on finalising this deal," he said.
Australia has traditionally supplied around a quarter of Iraq's wheat, making it Australia's third largest wheat market.
