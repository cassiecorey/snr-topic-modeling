Bird flu simulation finds response times wanting
While Australia is well equipped to deal with a bird flu outbreak, response times by government agencies need to be improved.
That is the finding of Exercise Eleusis, a three-day simulation of Australia's response to a fictional outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, held last year.
Deputy chief veterinary officer, Bob Biddle, says the report card also shows more cooperation is needed between animal and human health agencies, and farmers.
"The report shows that the right decisions were made and with the access to the right sort of information that was available out and about in the exercise scenario but that the committees could have perhaps reached those decisions more rapidly," he said.
