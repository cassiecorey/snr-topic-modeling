Abetz urges cooperation in illegal fishing fight
Australia is calling for a stronger global effort to combat illegal fishing.
Signatories to a United Nations agreement on fishing are meeting in New York to debate how to tackle the problem.
The UN says the world fishing fleet is two-and-a-half times above sustainable levels, and super vessels from countries like China and Indonesia are operating outside international law.
Australia's Fisheries Minister, Senator Eric Abetz, says more cooperation is needed to stop rampant illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which is decimating stocks.
"We see the agreement as very important but we now are getting to ensuring that it is properly implemented," he said.
