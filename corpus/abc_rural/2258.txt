Group seeks to inform Indigenous communities about NWI
A new group wants to help remote Aboriginal communities to learn more about the National Water Initiative (NWI).
The Indigenous Water Policy Group wants to break down barriers by translating policy into traditional languages.
Executive officer Joe Morrison says remote communities are still largely unaware of the implications of water trading and native title rights regarding water.
"We think that the native title process and the NWI only talks about customary use, and customary use as being for non-commercial purposes," he said.
