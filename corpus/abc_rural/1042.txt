Russia to open up beef export market
Russia will open up its beef export market to international bidders due to a shortage of beef from the European Union.
About 230,000 tonnes of beef is needed to fill the Russian quota, with Brazil and Australia considered to be the big contenders.
Prices for beef in Russia have jumped 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.
Andrew MacCallum from Meat and Livestock Australia says it is a significant new market and should keep international beef prices buoyant.
