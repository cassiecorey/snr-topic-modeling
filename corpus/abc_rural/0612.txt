DNA used to identify stolen sheep
Police have used DNA testing to identify sheep at the centre of stock theft investigations in Victoria.
The Mildura Magistrates Court has found a farmer from Murrayville, in the state's north-west, guilty of theft, after DNA testing proved the genetic line of 40 cross-bred lambs.
Senior constable Andrew Harris says while the value of the sheep was at the lower end of the scale, the case demonstrates the value of the technology in investigations.
