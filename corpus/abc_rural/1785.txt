Dairy farmers' incomes increase
Australian dairy farm cash incomes have increased by nearly a quarter in the past financial year to just over $100,000 a farm.
Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) show Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia performing strongly.
But incomes fell in Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland as the drought pushed up fodder costs and cut milk production.
Colin Mues, from ABARE, says high prices paid by dairy processors made a big difference to the bottom line.
"The main factor driving that was higher milk prices through improvements in the dairy market," he said.
"Production was fairly steady, it went down marginally at a national level but there was a fairly uniform improvement in prices across all states and I think that's been the key factor driving it and the price increases were, you know, between 3 and 5 per cent."
But dairy farmers in Western Australia refute ABARE's figures.
Farmer John Giumelli says cost of dairying land is so high that profit making is almost impossible, even with better milk prices.
"The attrition rate in dairy farms in WA is absolutely shocking but it's an indictment of what pressure the industry is under and I take no joy out of the ABARE figures," he said.
