Farmers call for consultation over water crisis
The National Farmers Federation is calling on the Federal Government to give farmers a place at the negotiating table, when deciding policy to deal with the current water crisis.
It says ad hoc state decisions, like the 32 per cent reduction of carry-over water for New South Wales irrigators, are damaging farmer confidence in water security.
NFF president David Crombie is defending the lobby group's role in influencing the debate.
