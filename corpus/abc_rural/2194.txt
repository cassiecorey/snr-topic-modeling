Govt assesses wheat export system future
The Federal Government has started considering the future of the wheat export system following the Cole inquiry report.
Federal Government ministers are satisfied they have survived the Cole inquiry unscathed.
But now they are facing the difficult task of deciding whether the wheat export system rorted by AWB needs to be changed.
Liberals including Wilson Tuckey and Bill Heffernan want change.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says his party wants to keep the single desk in some form, although he realises that is not the view of the whole Cabinet.
However he says AWB may yet be part of the solution.
US Wheat Associates, the export marketing arm which represents American wheat growers, wants the single desk removed.
The association's president, Alan Tracey, says Australian farmers have been duped by AWB and the single desk is distorting world trade.
He says the association will support moves by the powerful US Senate Agriculture Committee to conduct its own inquiry into AWB.
"AWB has a subsidiary in the United States, the funds that came from the oil-for-food program moved through US banks," he said.
"There are a lot of connections here and possible violations of US law.
