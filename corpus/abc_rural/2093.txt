Skills shortages, increased costs hit mining investment
Investment in Australian mining developments remains strong, but a new report says skills shortages and increased prices for materials and construction are causing delays, and driving up project costs.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says a record 94 projects, valued at $34.9 billion, are in the advanced planning or construction stage.
More than half are in coal and oil, with strong investment in iron, nickel, gold and alumina.
