Queenslander wins NFF top job
Queenslander David Crombie is the new president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF).
Mr Crombie is the former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia and former chairman of the Queensland Reds.
Mr Crombie takes over from outgoing president, cotton grower Peter Corish.
Victorian dairy farmer Allan Burgess was the other candidate for the peak farming group's top job.
The announcement was made in Canberra, where farmers from all over Australia and representatives of a wide range of agricultural industries are meeting, to draw up their strategies and priorities for the coming 12 months.
Delegates from around Australia will today be debating the NFF's stand on telecommunications and native vegetation.
The telecommunications debate is timely given the NFF's initial support for the Telstra plan to maintain a presence in rural Australia.
