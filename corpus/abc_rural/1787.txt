ACCC urged to investigate alleged price gouging
The NRMA is calling on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate what it alleges is price gouging by Australia's oil companies, as fuel prices fall.
NRMA director and former NFF president Graham Blight is meeting National party senators in Canberra today to discuss the issue.
He says claims by the oil companies that they are passing on all of the recent falls in wholesale fuel prices are simply not accurate.
"The Singapore unleaded price has dropped by 29 per cent," he said.
"The crude price has dropped 22 per cent. So the difference between what we've had here is a drop of 14 per cent and the Singapore unleaded is 15 per cent.
