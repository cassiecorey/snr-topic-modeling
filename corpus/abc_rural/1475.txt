Scientists to tackle ocean census
In a bid to measure the impact of the fishing industry scientists have decided to count every living thing in the ocean.
The world's first ocean census is under way and when it is finished in 2010 it will be used to help regulate the fishing industry.
Senior scientist on the project Ron O'Dor says identifying every ocean species is proving tough for some researchers.
"They were two and a half kilometres down in the water column on the end of a line chasing this octopus with a slurp gun that goes 'slurp' and sucks the animal in and then brings it back alive," he said.
