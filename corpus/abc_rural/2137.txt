City folk urged to 'sponsor a cow' to support dairy farmers
Citysiders are being encouraged to "sponsor a cow" to help a group of Victorian dairy farmers feed their livestock.
The Stanhope and District Development Committee has come up with the plan to help the district survive the drought.
Chairman Bob Holschier says the campaign will benefit the farmers but also help sponsors to learn about the farm sector.
