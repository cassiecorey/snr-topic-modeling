Farmers to import alternative dairy cattle feed
Dairy farmers will continue to use alternative feeds such as palm kernel meal as grain supplies tighten.
Farmers in Victoria say grain prices have jumped from $215 to $360 per tonne in recent weeks.
Brian Bailey, from grain price monitoring company AWF, says dairy farmers will have to import more of the alternative feeds.
"You can get the requirements of energy protein and amino acids from products such as palm kernel meal which comes from Malaysia," he said.
