Snowy River clearance work 'too little, too late'
A group of farmers in Victoria's Gippsland region says blockages at the mouth of the Snowy River are being overlooked.
Reduced flows and drought have caused a sandbar to form across the mouth of the Snowy at Marlo, flooding local pastures and crops.
Clearance work began yesterday but residents say it is too little, too late.
Parks Victoria ranger Dennis Matthews says opening the mouth of the Snowy is difficult and he sympathises with farmers whose properties have been flooded.
"It's not easy being a farmer enduring drought and so on, and then having something like this happen," he said.
"I can understand fully their plight A lot of people farm in low lying areas so I can understand that they would like to see conditions of opening changed.
Queensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg is pushing ahead with his plans to merge his party with the Liberals despite significant opposition from both federal Coalition party leaders.
The Prime Minister says he will only support the Nationals becoming Liberals, while federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile is worried his party will be destabilised by the discussions.
This morning in Canberra, National and Liberal politicians were locked in a joint party room meeting discussing the proposal but Mr Springborg says he does not need their approval.
"Queensland could still go it alone and there's a whole range of ways that you can do this to accommodate the concerns that have been raised because those matters have not had the chance to be able to be put," he said.
