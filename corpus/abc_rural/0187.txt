Ewe market remains firm
Ewe prices are going against the seasonal trend and maintaining good saleyard prices across Australia.
It is believed to be partly due to flock rebuilding after the drought and also a switch away from the high inputs and uncertainty of cropping.
Breeding stock is in demand from growers put off by narrowing grain profits.
Aaroy Yiori from the national livestock reporting service says farmers want ewes mainly for the prime lamb market.
"Re-stocker demand's pretty strong, especially on females and that's certainly one of the things that's underpinning the market," he said.
