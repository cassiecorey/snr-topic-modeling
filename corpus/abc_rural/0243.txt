Horticulture industry suppliers on notice to cut costs
Suppliers of materials, machinery and other goods to the horticulture sector have been placed on notice to cut costs to growers.
Fruit and vegetable growers have launched a class action against cardboard box maker, Amcor, seeking up to $300 million compensation over alleged price fixing on packaging.
They claim 17,000 growers and some major food manufacturers were overcharged more than $700 million for boxes and pallets.
Mike Badcock from grower group Ausveg says growers are now looking at costs across the sector.
"It seems quite suspicious doesn't it. America, the fuel price is only half what we pay in Australia, to put a pivot irrigator up in America, it costs you between a third and half what it costs to put one up in Australia, fertiliser is a lot cheaper in new Zealand," he said.
"We've really got to get to the bottom of a lot of these things in Australia and find out why it's costing us more to farm in Australia."
Despite claims farmers are losing bargaining power, a new report says selling produce under contract does not place growers at the mercy of big business.
The report, commissioned by the Australian Farm Institute, says there has been substantial growth in the level of farm produce sold on the contract system and prices are not necessarily falling.
Report author Mark Barber says it depends on the farmer.
"It opens up all sorts of new opportunities and some farmers will benefit more than others from this," he said.
