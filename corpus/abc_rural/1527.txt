Agriculture research process under scrutiny
Pressure is on Australia's agricultural research and development corporations (RDCS) to justify how they spend taxpayer dollars.
The chairs of 14 peak bodies have been meeting in Canberra this week.
Parliamentary secretary for Agriculture, Sussan Ley, wants more collaboration between the agencies, and a uniform way of assessing whether their research work is up to scratch.
"I'm waiting for them to come back to me with that, but I certainly don't want it to be a long process," she said.
"I want it to be an efficient process, I want it to be realistic and I want it to produce answers for people who have every right to ask the question, 'are we getting value for money?' - it's important to recognise that governments are really a major stakeholder in the RDC's.
