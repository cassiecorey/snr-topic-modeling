Irrigation pumping on unregulated streams stopped
The drought has forced an early halt to irrigation pumping on unregulated streams and rivers in New South Wales.
The Department of Natural Resources says it is unprecedented to see water levels fall so low in so many river systems this early in the season.
Water levels have reached precarious levels in southern, northern and far western regions, while in the central west pumping is expected to be halted within days.
Spokesman David Harris says he has never seen so many creeks and rivers drying up so early.
"This year is just horrendous, we've just had no winter flow, we've had no spring flow and as a consequence most of the unregulated streams have just stopped flowing," he said.
