Independent probe
Meanwhile, a key US Senator on farm issues is asking for an independent investigation of AWB's kickbacks and the failure of US authorities in that country to do anything about it.
US Senator Tom Harkin is asking the independent inspector-generals of the US Agriculture and State Departments to investigate the AWB and why the Bush Administration has brushed aside similar requests.
Senator Harkin's spokesman Dave Townsend says what happened to the $200 million in alleged AWB kickbacks is a key issue.
"Prior to the fall, those kickbacks were going to Saddam Hussein," he said.
"While Hussein is no longer in power, Senator Harkin would like to know where that money was going ... and why, at the time, ... we weren't about to figure out that those contracts still contained kickbacks."
Mr Townsend says Senator Harkin wants the $220 million recovered and returned to the Iraqi people.
