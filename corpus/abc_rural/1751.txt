Govt aims to refocus some drought funding
The Federal Agriculture Minister says the Government hopes in future to refocus some of its drought funding towards helping farmers to be better prepared for dry periods.
Peter McGauran says the Government is not planning to withdraw its current drought assistance, but says the most efficient farmers should be supported.
"Don't read into that that we're going to abolish interest rate subsidies," he said.
