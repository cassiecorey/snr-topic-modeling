Katherine School of the Air celebrates anniversary
There will be big celebrations in the Top End town of Katherine tonight, as the School of the Air marks its 40th anniversary.
These days the school serves 220 students.
But in 1966 the first teacher in charge, Ron Smith, began with eight students on HF radio.
"It really made me realise that so much depends on the family," he said.
"They need a tremendous amount of encouragement and support. It worked and I was talking to a family in Darwin and their lad was one of the early students, and they have gone on and travelled overseas and studied overseas.
