DNA cattle feed test draws attention
Queensland's Gold Coast saw a gathering of 650 people today for Beefex, the Australian lot feeders national conference.
The cost of grain feed is on everyone's lips.
The commercial release of a new DNA test that can identify which cattle are likely to put on the most weight with the least feed has been announced today.

Feedlotters might feed a steer 1.5 tonnes of feed over a 100 days.
The announcement has drawn lots of attention as feed prices spiral across the country.
