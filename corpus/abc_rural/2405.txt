Confidence about gm wheat trials
Victoria's first crop of genetically modified wheat could be in the ground as early as next year, despite a state moratorium on commercial crops of GM canola.
The Government has applied for a permit and hopes to have trials of the drought resistant wheat approved by June next year.
Dr Bruce Kefford from the Department of Primary Industries is confident of the trial's success.
"This is work we have done in collaboration with the CRC for Molecular Plant Breeding, some colleagues in South Australia, and other parties.
"There are actually a number of lines which have a number of potential treatments for drought resistance in them and we've got about thirty lines that will be trialled in quite small trials if it's approved√Ç".
