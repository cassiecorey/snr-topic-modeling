Milk, cheese, yoghurt prices to rise
On top of petrol hikes and higher interest rates, the cost of food is now on the way up.
National Foods and Fonterra say they will lift prices for milk, cheese, yoghurt and fruit juice products by up to 3 per cent, and supermarkets are expected to pass on the increase to shoppers.
The increases are to try to cope with increased packaging and transportation costs.
For farmers it is a different story, with most unable to increase their prices.
Andrew Young from the Central Markets Association says farm gate prices will not change just because wholesale prices have gone up.
"There's not an automatic link essentially unless they've got contract pricing in place, which for a lot of sectors of the industry that just doesn't exist, it's commodity market pricing," he said.
