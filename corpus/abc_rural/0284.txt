Urban dog owners take lead in sheepdog trials
City dog owners are starting to replace retired farmers on the sheepdog trial circuit.
The experts say they have noticed a big change, with city pet owners more interested in putting their dog and three sheep through an obstacle course, than competing in a traditional dog show.
Seven-time Australian representative Malcolm Taylor says while sheepdogs are being used less on the land, their popularity in the cities is growing.
"But I think the future for dog trialing is going to alter quite a bit and you'll see far more city dwellers that'll have a working dog in the city," he said.
