LOCAL FISH COSTLY FOR CHRISTMAS
The Sydney Fish Markets are preparing for the Christmas rush, with 80,000 customers expected through the doors this weekend.
But they'll be faced with an expensive decision about whether to pay higher prices for local produce, or buy cheaper frozen imports.
The price contrast is expected to be even greater this Christmas, with the markets' biggest supplier facing its worst year in four decades.
Russell Creighton from the Clarence River Fisherman's Co-operative says drought has claimed another casualty.
"The seafood catch has probably been one of the lowest I've experienced and I've been here for forty years.
"And the contributing factor playing a big part is the drought, because there's no nutrient running into the river, and the rivers are the nursery for both inshore and offshore species of prawns and crustaceans. So we're really feeling the pinch this Christmas√Ç".
