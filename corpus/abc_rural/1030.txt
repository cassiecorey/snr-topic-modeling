Scant rainfall dashes farmers' hopes
A forecast of heavy rain has ended in disappointment for South Australia's northern pastoralists.
The weather bureau was predicting falls of up to 40 millimetres in some parts, but most properties got less than 20.
Tony Williams from Mt Barry Station near Oodnadatta says it was an anti-climax.
"There was a big build up to this one ... but it was a bit of fizzer, there were good falls north of Oodnadatta, handy falls, but south down our way we only had nine millimetres - so very disappointing, really," he said.
"It's been eight months since we've had a decent fall.
"Around 30 millimetres would have been nice but maybe next time."
Meanwhile, grain farmers in north-west Victoria are hoping the weather bureau's prediction of rain this weekend is accurate.
There is no subsoil moisture on some farms at Ouyen, some farmers have given up on sowing crops, while others have significantly revised their plans.
Farmer Dean Munro is not sure what is in store for the crop he planted eight weeks ago.
"The stuff that we did sow only about 20 or 30 per cent has actually come up, the rest of it is still in the ground, things are looking pretty grim," he said.
"This weekend's probably the last roll of the dice for this crop I'd say.
"If we don't get substantial rain this weekend it's certainly in a fair bit of trouble."
But pastoralists in the Northern Territory have fared much better.
Every district received falls in the past 24 hours.
In the Alice Springs district, most communities and stations received between 10 and 20 millimetres, with 54 millimetres recorded at Hamilton Downs Station.
