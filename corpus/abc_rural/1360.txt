Bacchus Marsh irrigators offered extra water
Irrigators in Victoria's major lettuce growing region are being offered a 5 per cent water allocation to keep going, as long as they are prepared to pay for it.

"There were some capital costs and some of those we will recover through the pricing of the water," he said.
"The water's available to our irrigators are Bacchus Marsh at an additional $410 a megalitre.
