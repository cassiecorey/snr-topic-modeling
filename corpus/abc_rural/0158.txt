Growers reject latest NZ apple bid
Apple and pear growers have rejected New Zealand's latest bid to export apples to Australia.
Submissions closed yesterday on a new draft risk import analysis which would allow New Zealand apples into the country.
But growers like Tom Quirke from Loxton, in South Australia, say the risk of the disease fireblight is still too great.
"The last thing we need is to have something further to cause an industry to become unviable and that's exactly what would happen if New Zealand apples arrived in Australia," he said.
"It's not if we got fire blight but when we get fire blight. It's too much of a risk. We could never support that."
