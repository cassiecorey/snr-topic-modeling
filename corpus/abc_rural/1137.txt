No growth predicted for south-west WA pastures
The CSIRO says pasture growth rates in Western Australia's south-west are shaping up to be the worst in nearly 100 years.
New satellite data shows growth rates are expected to be down 60 per cent on last year, due to abnormal weather patterns.
The CSIRO's Dr Steve Gherhardi says, as a result, many farmers have reduced stock numbers to give paddocks a spell.
"Even now, if farmers have had a break, they'd need to make decisions on how long they would want to defer that pasture to ensure that they'll get some growth occurring," he said.
