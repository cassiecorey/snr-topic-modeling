Conference to focus on sustainability of Indigenous communities
The future of remote Indigenous communities is in the spotlight at a national conference in Perth today.
Across Australia, 250 delegates will attend the conference to look at how to make the communities sustainable.
Doctor Martin Anda from Murdoch University says they will not be focusing on past failures, but looking for the success stories.
"[We will be] sharing ideas together on exactly how we might formulate some of these new ways forward to try bringing more life and sustainability to some of these far-flung communities," he said.
