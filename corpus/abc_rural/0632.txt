WA bans biodiesel plants
Western Australia's Agriculture Protection Board has placed a state-wide ban on two plants being heavily promoted on the Internet as sources of biodiesel.
Bellyache bush and physic nut are both invasive plants, highly toxic to humans and livestock.
Both plants are already on the WA declared plants list, but their status has been upgraded to make sure they are banned state-wide.
