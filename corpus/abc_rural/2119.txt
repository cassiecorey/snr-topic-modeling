Talks aim to lift live sheep export ban
The Federal Government is in talks with Israel to try to lift a ban on live sheep exports from Australia.
The ban was imposed after six sheep were found to have scabby mouth disease on a shipment last month.
Israel buys just 1 per cent of Australia's live sheep exports and 6 per cent of live cattle.
Livecorp's Cameron Hall has confirmed 241 cattle died on another shipment to Israel this month and he says Australia's reputation could be harmed.
