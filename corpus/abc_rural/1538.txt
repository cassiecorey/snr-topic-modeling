Global warming faster than thought: ANU expert
A leading climate change scientist says there is a high risk temperatures are rising at a more rapid rate than experts predicted five years ago.
Will Steffen from the Australian National University says increased warming of the earth is preventing the land's natural absorption of carbon and that is enhancing the problem.
He says the last major international climate outlook paper predicted temperatures would rise by between 2 and 2.5 degrees by the end of the century.
