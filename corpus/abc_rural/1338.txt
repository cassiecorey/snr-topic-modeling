Farmers predict crop failure within weeks
Farmers in Victoria's Wimmera Mallee grain growing region say if it does not rain within two weeks their crops will fail.
The effects of a lack of rain have been made worse by a run of frosts and strong drying winds.
Neil Simpson who has planted 1,500 hectares of wheat at Berriwillock in the southern Mallee says the earlier sown crop is already dying and it is looking bleak for the rest.
"Assuming that there isn't further rain, the late crops will also fail and they may not even produce a head in the circumstances so the outlook is certainly very dismal at this point and continuing to deteriorate," he said.
