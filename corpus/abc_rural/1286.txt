Rain cheers Louth race goers
Recent rain was a reason to celebrate at the 48th annual Louth races in western New South Wales over the weekend.
After almost a decade of drought, the red dust has been replaced by a blanket of green.
About 4,000 people flocked into Louth and committee president Tess Le Leviere says the rain made a difference.
"People started working about two months ago on the different jobs and they get together at the pub and talk about it and by the time it is the day there's been a lot of excitement and people forget just for a little while their problems," she said.
"We've been very lucky because we've have three inches - nearly four - of rain over the last six weeks and everything's very green.
