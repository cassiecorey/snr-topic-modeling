Groote Eylandt given Indigenous protection status
Australia's third largest island is being declared an Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) today.
Stakeholders have gathered to celebrate on Groote Eylandt in Northern Territory waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Under the agreement, the traditional owners of Groote Eylandt who speak Anindilyakwa will manage their land for conservation and heritage values.
Land Council Chairman Tony Wurramarrba says a local manganese mine is part of the plan.
"Virtually means that we can look after our land, more efficiently. We are in a very unique situation here on an island," he said.
"We don't have any feral animals that they do have on the mainland. One of the main changes that we see (is that ) we (will) have more control over our land.
