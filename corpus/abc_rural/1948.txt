ACT officially in drought
The ACT has been drought-declared, giving 90 farmers access to federal and local government assistance.
As part of the package, rates will not have to be paid and rural lease payments will be deferred.
The ACT Government also plans to give farmers transport subsidies, in line with New South Wales.
Grazier Tony Griffin says he would normally be able to cut enough silage for next winter, but not this year.
"I've got five semi-loads of hay starting today actually," he said.
"We're getting it from western NSW, it's really failed wheat crops."
Meanwhile Australia's drought and its human toll are getting a lot of attention in the United States.
US agriculture officials are watching the Australian drought disaster closely and not just its impact on US wheat prospects, but its toll on lives.
From a USDA reporter: "A farmer suicide every four days ... that's what's happening in Australia right now, according to a mental health group there."
And USDA meteorologist Harlan Shannon says a developing El Nino could mean more hot, dry weather for Australian grain and livestock.
"It's not going to be good for Australian farmers, at least, historically speaking, it hasn't been, And so, if it does continue to intensify, the road ahead doesn't look too good," he said.
