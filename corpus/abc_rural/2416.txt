US considers farm spending cuts
The US administration is openly discussing the need to cut US farm spending, even before a possible resumption of world trade talks.
US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns told a reporter recently that the US farm support system may be sitting in quick sand, under challenge abroad in the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and under fire at home with a budget strained by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We're doing all we can to get the federal budget under control," he said.
"The leadership now of the House and the Senate have talked very, very publicly about this notion that you have to pay for things as you go.
"Those are strong messages that the budget is going to have an impact on policy."
