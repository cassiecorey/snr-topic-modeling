Grain companies to feel impact of drought
An agribusiness analyst predicts the unprecedented drought will wipe tens of millions of dollars of profit off key grain handling and marketing companies.
Austock predicts Australian winter wheat production will be down 60 per cent on the national five year average to 13.4 million tonnes.
Analyst Paul Jensz says while many key grain businesses have cut costs and rationalised, it will not be enough to curtail the effect of the massive drop in grain volumes.
"Graincorp for instance will be the most impacted, it will have a negative profit of around minus $20 million for 07 in our estimates," he said.
