Assistance scheme extended for cyclone-affected growers
The Federal Government will extend a scheme to help north Queensland farmers whose crops were wiped out by cyclone Larry earlier this year.
Employers who qualify receive $200 per worker each week to help them keep staff and skills in the region during the tough recovery period.
Growers were hoping the scheme would run for 36 weeks but at this stage it will be limited to 26.
Denis Rigato's banana and avocado farms were badly damaged by the cyclone and he says any extra assistance is welcome.
"Any sort of help we get is much needed - it's going to help with our existing labour force," Mr Rigato said.
"Even though we've cut back it allows us to keep them [employees] going on, you know more time down the track.
