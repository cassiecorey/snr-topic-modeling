AWH renews Yennora lease
The future of wool sales in Sydney looks more secure, after a decision by Australian Wool Handlers to renew its lease on the Yennora selling centre.
The new five-year agreement will take effect from July 2007, with AWH to lease two thirds of the current space, including the auction rooms, administration offices and the container handling area.
