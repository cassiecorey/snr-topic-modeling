Shipment fodder blamed for livestock deaths
The use of new fodder on four live sheep shipments last year is being blamed for a slight rise in livestock death rates.
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) and Livecorp figures show small increases in mortality rates for sheep and cattle during 2005, and a slight fall in goat deaths.
Out of 4.2 million sheep exported last year, 0.95 per cent died.
MLA general manager Mike Hayward says that was largely due to the fodder, which was less dusty but contained less fibre and nutrients.
"It essentially led to an increase in mortalities because a more than normal number of the sheep failed to eat," he said.
"There was a higher level of disease in the animals as a result of that lack of fibre.
"It was as simple as that."
