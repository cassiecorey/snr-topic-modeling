Money laundering law changes 'draconian'
Rural bank branches and agencies could be under threat from proposed changes to federal money laundering legislation.
While the laws are designed to target organised crime, a report by the Chartered Secretaries of Australia says it will be too hard for many smaller bank agencies to comply.
Chief executive Tim Sheehy says banks will need to have personal contact with clients, there will be changes to identification requirements and big fines.
"They are draconian, they're unfortunately a one size fits all approach," he said.
"The way that the proposed legislation is, there's no difference in penalties for a fairly minor transgression or a major $10 million one if you're an agent.
"[When] you're faced with the risk of a major penalty for a small error, you're probably going to pull out of the business."
