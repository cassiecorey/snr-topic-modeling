Volunteer firefighters battle Vic blazes
Volunteer firefighters in Victoria are continuing to pour into the mountains to relieve weary colleagues.
Milder conditions are helping firefighting efforts, although temperatures are due to climb again later this week.
Myrrhee in the north-eastern King Valley is not under direct threat, so members of its fire brigade have joined the frontline effort.
Captain Bill Forge says the volunteers are doing all they can.
"Our crew have been working from fires at Whitfield for the last week, they're not at Myrrhee at all most of them," he said.
