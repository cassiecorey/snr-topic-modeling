AWB legal battle back before court
The legal battle over the future of the oil-for-food inquiry is back in the Federal Court today.
This time a challenge has been initiated by Commissioner Terence Cole, who does not want to participate in the case about AWB's claim to withhold documents from his inquiry.
The Commissioner's lawyers are asking the court to determine the legitimacy of AWB's claim of legal professional privilege over 1,300 documents.
