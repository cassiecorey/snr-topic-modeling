Govt's training vouchers 'a positive response'
Rural training bodies have given the Federal Government's plans to give training vouchers to school drop-outs a cautious welcome.
Prime Minister John Howard says people over 25, who did not complete Year 12, will be able to use the $3,000 vouchers to pay for vocational courses in TAFEs, federal colleges and private institutions.
The chairman of the Rural Training Council of Australia, Peter Griffin, says the plan would go some way towards easing rural skills shortages.
"It's a very positive response. The skills shortage is a complex issue through rural and regional Australia," he said.
