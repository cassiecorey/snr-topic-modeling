Farmers back Wimmera water decision
Farmers have welcomed a decision by the Victorian Government to halt environmental flows down rivers in the Wimmera region.
With water storages at critical levels, the government says the water earmarked for the environment will be reserved for emergencies including fire fighting.
Colin Coates from the Victorian Farmers Federation's Drought Committee,
is worried about how quickly fire brigades will be able to get hold of it.
"It's a long way on a hot northerly day to cart water out this area, so that is a big concern," he said.
