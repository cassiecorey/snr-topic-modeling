Three-legged Tasmanian cow to get prosthetic leg
Tasmania's now famous three-legged dairy cow, Theresa, looks like becoming the first in Australia to have a prosthetic leg.
The heifer had one of her back legs amputated after falling down an embankment and being a valuable asset, owner Geoff Heazlewood wanted to keep her.
He says the response to his call for help has been overwhelming and work has begun on a new prosthetic leg.
"There seems to be a lot of people interested in her welfare," he said.
