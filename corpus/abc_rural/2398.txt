CWA distributes Xmas cheer to drought-stricken families
The Country Women's Association (CWA) has distributed some Christmas cheer to 680 families and 40 communities in drought-stricken New South Wales.
The state branch of the CWA has been allocating emergency funds as part of a Federal Government aid program in October.
Up to $2,000 has been available to families to meet food and utility costs, while grants of $3,000 have helped towns to hold community events.
Vice president Colleen Wills says the money has gone where it is needed most.
"To keep the phones going, car, for petrol, to get to town to do the shopping, to doctors - it's all the basics," she said.
