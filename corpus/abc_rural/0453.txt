Resources boom raises housing shortage fears in silver city
The resources boom has raised fears of a housing shortage in the silver city of Broken Hill, in far western New South Wales.
With the opening of the Bemax mineral sand mine and the development of the Honeymoon uranium mine, there are concerns the town will not be able to accommodate an influx of workers.
Broken Hill real estate agent Jim Hickey says the mining industry is now looking to house workers in serviced apartments, which are in short supply.
"We're going to be shortly in need of some good development if other companies start to bring people in," he said.
