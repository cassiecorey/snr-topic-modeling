Greens call for climate change inquiry
The Greens are calling on the Federal Government to establish a Senate inquiry into the implications of climate change for the future of Australian agriculture.
The party says climate change could profoundly affect rural communities and is vital to get a clear picture of what steps can be taken now to minimise the impact.
The chair of the Senate's rural and regional affairs committee, Senator Bill Hefferenan, has indicated he will take the Greens proposal to his Liberal partyroom.
Greens Senator Rachel Siewert is hopeful there will be enough support for an inquiry.
"We also want to look at what we can do about it, what are the adaptation strategies needed to deal with these impacts on our rural communities to ensure that they are viable," he said.
