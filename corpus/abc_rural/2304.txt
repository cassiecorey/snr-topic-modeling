Drought won't stop delivery of PM's Xmas tree
Not even the festive season can escape the drought, with this year's harvest of Christmas trees producing smaller trees than usual due to poor rainfall.
Christmas tree farmer Gary Black from Gippsland in Victoria says trees from the southern states are in high demand.
He says one of his special customers will receive the best tree he has to offer.
