Poppy processor defends price cut
Poppy processor, Tasmanian Alkaloids says its latest price cuts will not be a disaster for Tasmanian growers.
The company will slash prices for the coming crop by 17 per cent, although it plans to double the size of its supply contracts.
The Poppy Growers Association says the price cut can not be supported, but Rick Rockliff from Tasmanian Alkaloids says higher yielding varieties and a better season should help farmers to improve their profits.
"We feel confident that if growers pay attention to detail and follow their field officers' advice, given a more normal season, we're pretty confident that growes will have substantially more money in their bank accounts this time next year," he said.
