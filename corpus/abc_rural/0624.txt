Tomato growers aim for sweet success
Growing sweeter tomatoes has been identified as the major goal for Australian growers over the next five years.
Processing tomato growers, whose crops are made into paste and sauce, are currently drawing up their Industry strategic plan.
Over the last 30 years, the amount of tomatoes produced per hectare has risen from 25 to 84 tonnes.
But the chair of the Australian Processing Tomato Research Council, Ian Bryce, says their taste suffered.
"The sweetness of tomatoes has gone down," he said.
