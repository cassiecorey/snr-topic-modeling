Rodeo nominations sky-rocket
Hundreds of spectators and competitors are expected to descend on the historic Top End town of Pine Creek tomorrow.
After a three year hiatus, the rodeo is back.
The town is also buzzing with the prospect of new gold and iron ore mines opening.
School teacher and rodeo competitor Mary-Ellen Willis says the popularity of the event is growing across the Northern Territory.
"Last year there was a low number of competitors. This year it's just sky-rocketing. We have over 130 nominations so far," she said.
