Science students needed to combat future climate change
A lack of students wanting to study agriculture and science is causing concern.
Universities and scientific bodies say the shortage could hurt Australia's ability to cope with issues like climate change and natural resource management.
The University of Sydney is blaming negative perceptions of the rural economy due to the drought, despite strong demand for graduates.
CSIRO spokesman Murray Cameron says a shortage of maths graduates has already delayed some of its research programs.
"A lot of Australia's history in agriculture, for example, has been in our ability to use genetics to breed better animals, better plant species, a lot of that in the future is about using mathematics effectively," he said.
