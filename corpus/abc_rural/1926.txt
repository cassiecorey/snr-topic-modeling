Vets to audit captive devils after tumour discovery
Vets in Tasmania are conducting an audit of a wildlife parks in the north of the State after the discovery this week of two devils with the devastating facial tumour disease.
It is the first time the disease has been found within a captive population.
It has already wiped out half the wild devil population.
Veterinary pathologist Stephen Pyecroft says as yet there is no screening test available for the disease, so it is a waiting game for the rest of the devils at the wildlife park.
"One of the areas that we have been looking at reasonably closely since the start of the program is to try to get an indicator test or the thing that we are sort of calling a clinical test for the cancer," he said.
