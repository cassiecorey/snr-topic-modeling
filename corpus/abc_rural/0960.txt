Apple growers look to boost productivity
Australian apple growers are investigating ways to make their orchards more efficient, to compete with the low production costs of other countries.
The industry will set up 60 trial sites around the country to compare different planting styles.
The chairman of Apple and Pear Australia, Darral Ashton, says one option is to double the number of trees per hectare, using dwarf root stock.
"The trees don't take the usual say four or five years to come into production - they come into production very easily," he said.
"Because you have so many trees per hectare, each tree doesn't have to carry so many apples to get that high production per hectare.
