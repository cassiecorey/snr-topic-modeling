Cattle feedlot to host ethanol plant
International investment firm Babcock and Brown is planning to build a $120 million ethanol plant at a cattle feedlot in southern New South Wales.
The proposed facility at Rockdale Beef at Yanco will produce up to 150 million litres of ethanol a year, and the grain by-product fed to the cattle.
Rockdale's general manager Paul Trojah says the ethanol production will complement the feedlot's plans for a biogas plant to generate electricity from cow manure.
"Rockdale Feedlock will be producing about five megawatts of energy a day from all of the waste streams," he said.
