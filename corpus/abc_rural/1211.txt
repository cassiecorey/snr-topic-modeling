Coalition MPs pressure Govt over fuel prices
The push is on to find a way to reduce fuel prices with backbenchers pressuring the Federal Government to intervene.
Coalition MPs will meet in Canberra on Monday to put forward ideas to ease the fuel price pain, including more help for the ethanol and biofuels industry, excise cuts and tax concessions for rural and remote areas.
Federal Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane has previously been opposed to extending help to the biofuels sector, but now says it will be considered if it leads to cheaper fuel costs.
"The Federal Government is already providing some assistance to particularly the biofuels industry to get cheaper fuel onto the market and we are disappointed to date that part of that assistance is not actually reaching the motorists, so we'll continue to look at options there," he said.
"I guess Monday's partyroom offers us the opportunity to hear what the backbenchers are suggesting and to consider some further options."
In the United States, the peak body for corn growers in the mid-west believes biofuel production has brought life back to dying farming communities.
Almost 60 million tonnes of grain is processed each year in the United States to make biofuels.
Bruce Stockman from the Minnesota Corngrowers Association says ethanol has delivered a big boost.
"Everyone of the communities that built one of these ethanol plants has come back to life," he said.
"They were on the decline and they have vitality now.
"The dollars that the state gave as an incentive for the first 15,000 gallons of production has paid the state back 16-fold.
