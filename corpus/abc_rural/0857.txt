Dried mangoes head to E Timor orphanages
Children in orphanages across the capital of East Timor will be chewing on Northern Territory 'mango leathers' this month.
Kakadu Dried Fruits, based at Batchelor, has donated 500 packets of dried mango.
Owner Doug Allsopp says he has more to offer as food aid, if the first batch is well received.
"We had an excess of this product [and] because our product doesn't contain any preservatives or additives, it doesn't have an indefinite shelf life," he said.
"Rather than allow the product to go to waste we thought that people in East Timor could probably put it to good use.
