Mini turbine generates farm power
A Victorian dairy farmer has invented a mini hydroelectric turbine to generate on-farm power.
The Sundermann turbine, named after farmer Fred Sundermann, can be used in slow-moving water, like irrigation channels and streams.
It is about the size of a large washing machine and is designed to generate power in remote areas.
Mr Sundermann says he hopes his turbine can be used to power remote communities around the world.
"I have dreams for the turbine," he said.
