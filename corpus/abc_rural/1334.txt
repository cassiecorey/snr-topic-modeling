Apple, pear industry unveils competitiveness plan
The apple and pear industry has launched an ambitious research program to make Australian orchards globally competitive.
The million-dollar program, Future Orchards 2012, was unveiled in Hobart this morning.
Years of rising production costs and low prices have left Australian apple and pear growers fighting for survival.
The industry has to reduce costs while increasing the amount of fruit harvested per hectare, and Future Orchards 2012 should prove it can be done.
The current yield is 20 tonnes of fruit per hectare from an average of 640 trees.
Under the plan tonnage would more than doubled and high density planting would almost triple the amount of trees.
The intensive orcharding would also be capital intensive, costing up to $60,000 a hectare.
