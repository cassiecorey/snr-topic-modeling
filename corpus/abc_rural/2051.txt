Wool growers seek Wool Poll audit
A group of wool growers has lodged a complaint against Australian Wool Innovation (AWI), accusing it of failing to conduct this year's Wool Poll transparently.
The five growers from WA and New South Wales, want to know why 50,000 voting packs were sent out, when there are only 30,000 eligible voters.
The growers have called on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to make sure AWI employees do not count or tabulate the votes and are seeking an immediate post-vote audit.
Signatory Shane Edwards who was an unsuccessful candidate for the AWI board in 2005, says he has real concerns
"There's a number of people that have contacted me and opinion around [is] that we're not too sure whether that satisfies true and democratic process," he said.
"So we feel it's important to keep asking these questions because the question is this, what has AWI got to hide by denying this democratic process?"
But AWI says this group of growers continues to try to destabilise the Wool Poll, which it says is transparent in every way.
