Looming lettuce shortage prompts grower to buy new farm
With a looming shortage of lettuces due to water restrictions near Melbourne, one of Australia's largest growers has been forced to buy land in another part of Victoria.
Water allocations have been severely slashed in the Bacchus Marsh district due to low storage levels.
Frank Ruffo from National Fresh Salads has now bought a farm near Swan Hill, on the Murray River, to obtain more secure water allocations.
"This is probably the first time in history that Bacchus Marsh has been so severely hit, prior to that we haven't really had a great problem with water," Mr Ruffo said.
