Goats theft to hurt students
The head of an agricultural college in western Queensland says the theft of up to 300 boer goats will have a major impact on breeding and teaching programs.
Ten pure bred bucks, 90 does and up to 200 kids valued at $13,000 were stolen from the property, Manningham, near Longreach.
Peter Scott from the Australian Agricultural College Corporation says the theft will hurt students.
"Thirteen thousand dollars is a significant commercial loss for us because all our pastoral operations must support themselves, but you know 90 does out of our breeding herd that's a significant loss," he said.
"We're probably trying to develop a really good commercial meat goat flock so that we've got a good model for teaching and demonstration purposes."
