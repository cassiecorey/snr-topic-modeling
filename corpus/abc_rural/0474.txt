Economist warns about spending
The tax cuts are expected to ease pressure on rural households which have faced higher petrol prices and grocery bills in recent months.
The experts say while the cuts will not put pressure on interest rates in the short term, there are no guarantees the Reserve Bank will not increase rates towards the end of the year.
ANZ chief economist Saul Eslake says there are still reasons to be cautious about spending.
"Even allowing for the fact that people in rural areas tend to drive longer distances than those in the city, the tax cuts are enough to offset the most recent roughly 10 cent a litre increase in petrol prices and the rise in interest rates," he said.
"But any further rise in petrol prices or indeed in interest rates would probably be sufficient to eliminate the benefits of the Budget tax cut altogether."
Meanwhile Treasurer Peter Costello told a media conference yesterday the only way fuel prices will come down is if the cost of crude oil falls.
There is more than $11 million allocated for two new studies on the use of biofuels but Greens Senator Christine Milne says Mr Costello is wasting his time spending up big on roads, when it is becoming too expensive to drive on them.
"He's about the only person in Australia who doesn't see increasing oil prices as a major issue," she said.
