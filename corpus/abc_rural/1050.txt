Farmers in the central cropping belt of New South Wales had a short-term reprieve, with falls of between 20 and 30 millimetres ensuring the survival of winter wheat crops.
But the best falls were in the northern and far western regions, with the top total of 60 millimetres recorded at Louth, west of Bourke.
Local grazier Wally Mitchell says it is great.
"This has been a magnificent rain change. Many of us have been pushing scrub, feeding cotton seed, keeping our breeders alive and some of us had even had a big punt, and joined, so the little lambs are just coming on the ground here and this will really turn the job around for us," he said.
Parts of Victoria were luckier than others, with talkback callers to the ABC reporting falls of up to 60 millimetres in the state's north.
