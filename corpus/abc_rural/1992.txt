Govt considers drought aid for rural businesses
The Deputy Prime Minister says the Federal Government is now considering extending drought assistance to farm-dependent businesses.
Rural businesses say they have been hit just as hard by the drought and cannot keep going without support.
Mark Vaile says measures are being considered to try to keep young people on the land and to ensure businesses survive.
"Circumstances have been presented to us where there are directly agricultural-related small businesses, like harvesting contractors, spray contractors, that are being significantly affected in many EC [exceptional circumstances] areas," he said.
