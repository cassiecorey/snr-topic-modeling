Glenda heads toward Pilbara coast
Western Australian mining communities are on red alert as tropical cyclone Glenda approaches the Pilbara coast.
The industry has come to a standstill as it prepares for gale force winds and possible flooding from the category 4 cyclone.
Iron ore boats which were loading in the Dampier Port have been sent out to sea to try to avoid the path of the cyclone.
Harbour master Vic Justice says inside the port all the berths are empty and equipment has been tied down.
"The vessels at the various terminals as they completed loading they sailed to put out to sea and get sufficient sea room to ride out the cyclone," he said.
