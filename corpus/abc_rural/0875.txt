Farm lobby group concerned over biosecurity laws
The New South Wales Farmers Association says it has found three major flaws with Australia's biosecurity legislation.
The farm body commissioned barrister Tom Brennan to identify which laws might be legally challenged, amid concern that communication between farmers and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has broken down.
Chairman of the association's quarantine committee, Peter Carter, says Mr Brennan's advice has raised a number of concerns.
"The first one is that the import risk analysis has no legal status, which is quite frightening and can be ignored by AQIS," Mr Carter said.
"Secondly, he found that there needs to be better definition of the way that the minister consults with AQIS, or doesn't consult with them, but it needs to be defined in law because at the moment there is a big hole in the law over that."
