'Ultra virgin' olive oil technique patented
A Tasmanian olive grower has patented a new oil processing technique to produce what he calls "ultra virgin" olive oil.
Brian Hinson says olives grown in Tasmania's cold climate produce higher than world standard levels of oleic acid, giving an even healthier oil that should attract a premium.
He says the secret to the high oil levels is harvesting early and taking no more than 12 hours from picking to processing.
