Record price set for yearling at Sydney sale
The thoroughbred industry has set a new record price for a yearling at the Easter sales in Sydney.
South African trainer Charles Laird paid $3 million for a Redoutes' Choice colt last night, beating the previous record of $2.5 million.
The record came as a surprise for the breeder.
It is the best ever yearling sale on Australian soil.
After two days of selling, buyers have spent $68 million on 240 lots, with the average price at more than $100,000 above the previous year.
Breeder of the $3 million colt Arthur Mitchell of the Yarraman Park Stud in the Hunter Valley agreed there was some luck needed but says breeding judgment helped.
"We started to get a bit of a whisper that the few Redoutes' were going quite well and we needed a stallion with a bit of size," Mr Mitchell said.
