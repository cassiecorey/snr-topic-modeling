Scientists discover bug behind sheep mastitis
Scientists have discovered sheep mastitis is being caused by a different bug than first thought.
The inflammation of milk glands kills 5 per cent of ewes in Poll Dorset, Suffolk and Texel flocks each year.
Dr Stuart Barber from the University of Melbourne has found mannheimia is the most common bacteria causing the problem.
It was previously thought staphylococcus brought on the disease, as it does in cows.
Dr Barber says this new information is crucial.
