NFF 'lives in hope' of trade talks breakthrough
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) is confident there is still life in World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks, despite another failure to reach agreement on agriculture over the weekend.
United States and European negotiators went into the talks saying they were prepared to move on farm reforms.
However, negotiators in Geneva say those nations have failed to match their rhetoric with action.
An agreement on agriculture is the crucial first step in securing broader trade deals around industrial goods and services.
Trade policy manager with the NFF, Scott Mitchell, says while it is been a frustrating process is not over yet.
"WTO is the main game," Mr Mitchell said.
"We live in hope that ministers will go home and reflect on what's happened here this week and will realise that we do have a narrow window of opportunity to make global trading rules better for a long time.
