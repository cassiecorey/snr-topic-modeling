Grain growers expected to approach plantings with 'caution'
High fuel and fertiliser costs, a low Australian dollar and global grain prices will affect plantings for this season's grains crops.
Forecasters say most farmers are expecting average seasonal conditions but there is still uncertainty about expected prices.
Plantings of wheat, barley and canola are all tipped to be similar to last season.
Ron Storey from Australian Wheat Forecasters thinks many growers will play it safe.
"I think a lot of farmers are still under financial pressure. Whilst in a yield sense last year didn't turn out too badly, across Australia, the prices of course were very, very low around harvest time so people are pretty nervous about that and they'll be looking for a recovery year this year and approaching it with quite a bit of caution I'd think," he said.
With average rain, Mr Storey's forecasting a national wheat crop of around 22 million tonnes for the 2006-07 season.
And there is some good news, a drop in forecast corn plantings in the US is expected to lead to improved wheat prices.
While less corn will be grown, there is expected to be high demand for the crop from the growing ethanol industry.
