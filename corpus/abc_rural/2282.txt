US citrus export prices skyrocket
Citrus exports to the United States this year have attracted some of their highest prices in years.
Exports of navel oranges were down 33 per cent on the initial forecasts due to severe frost damage, with 1.4 million cartons shipped.
Greg Nelson from DNE World Fruit Sales says quality has been a factor in the good prices.
"We really applaud the efforts of the growers, the packers, the quality control inspectors in Australia because the condition of the fruit was excellent," he said.
