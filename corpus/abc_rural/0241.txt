Court postpones decision on AWB 'apology' document
A decision on whether AWB's so-called 'apology' document should be made public has been postponed until late April.
This morning the Federal Court ruled it would allow further evidence from AWB supporting its claim of legal professional privilege.
The document was initially provided to the Cole inquiry along with other evidence prepared by AWB company secretary Dr Richard Fuller.
A draft apology, it was written by former managing director Andrew Lindberg, after a US-based public relations specialist advised AWB to over-apologise, to try to counter any corporate scandal relating to the oil-for-food program.
At this morning's hearing, the Federal Court heard AWB would provide a second witness statement testifying the apology was prepared as part of lawyer-client meetings and as such should remain confidential.
AWB also questioned the power of Commissioner Terence Cole to make any rulings around lawyer-client confidentiality, an issue disputed by lawyers acting on behalf of the commission.
A full hearing has been adjourned until April 24.
Meanwhile another two senior staff members have resigned from AWB.
