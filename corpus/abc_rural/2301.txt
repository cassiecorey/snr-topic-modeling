Buffalo whisperer hopes for more support to send buffaloes to Aceh
Efforts have begun to send another shipment of trained buffaloes from the Northern Territory to the Indonesian province of Aceh.
Seven water buffalo were sent to remote rural villages earlier this year to help residents recover from the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.
Buffalo whisperer Graham Heffernan says the villagers have been frustrated by delays in replacing their important beasts of burden.
He is hoping the Federal Government will support plans to send another 50 by April.
"One of the first things one of the farmers said to me was, 'why so long'?" Mr Heffernan said.
"He wasn't having a go at me ... taking so long to get the buffalos there, it was like, 'all this other aid has happened here in Aceh, why has it taken so long for someone to bring buffaloes to us, because that's what we really need'.
"And that's just the beginning you know. Like hopefully in 12-18 months we may be sending them in hundreds per month."
The first Australian aid donation of trained water buffalo was the result of an unlikely alliance between a buffalo whisperer, a private benefactor, Newcastle surfers, the live export industry, shipping, fodder, trucking and quarantine authorities.
