AWB 'apology document' suppression ruling looms
A bid by wheat exporter AWB to stop the release of an "apology document" is being heard in the Federal Court in Melbourne.
Earlier this month the AWB board voted to lodge the court challenge to AWB inquiry Commissioner Terence Cole's decision to lift a non-publication order on the document, which was prepared for the company last year.
The document was written by a crisis management expert, who suggested the company take a strategy of "over-apology".
Commissioner Cole ruled the document was not prepared for the purpose of legal advice and so could be published.
An AWB spokesman said the board felt the document, and others to do with AWB's internal investigation into the scandal, should be protected by legal professional privilege.
Former managing director Andrew Lindberg has told the court he engaged a US public relations consultant to put together the statement of contrition ,which would be presented to the Cole inquiry.
Under cross-examination he denied the statement was prepared for PR purposes but maintained it was part of the company's legal strategy.
However Mr Lindberg acknowledged any statement to the inquiry would attract widespread publicity.
The court is expected to make a decision today on whether to release the document.
