Mixed reaction to airport ID cards
Security at regional airports is being stepped up from today with the introduction of compulsory identification cards for all staff.
All airport workers from pilots to cleaners will need clearance from ASIO, the Department of Immigration and the Federal Police.
But not everyone is happy.
Sonja Mitchell from aviation company Sling Air, in the far north of Western Australia, says the cards are a huge cost and it is difficult to justify the security benefits,
"All it means really is extra cost, It has no obvious safety or security benefit at all, especially in a town like Kununurra," she said.
"We don't have fencing around the airport perimeter, there is fencing up to a point where the jets in at the airport terminal, the rest is just the same as usual. It's only an added cost of $180 per staff member that needs to go airside."
