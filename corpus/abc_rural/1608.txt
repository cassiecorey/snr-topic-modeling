Dry winter impacts on grain crop
The forecast for this year's grain crop has taken another big hit.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics says record low winter rainfall will lead to a 36 per cent drop in production to 26 million tonnes.
Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia are expected to be hardest hit, with the canola crop tipped to be the worst in 10 years.
Barley will be down 40 per cent and Profarmer analyst Richard Koch says current warm weather across south-eastern Australia could slice another 4 million tonnes off the already low wheat crop.
"There's crops from about Narrabri down through Victoria that are in the balance at the moment and would need further rain to guarantee yields," he said.
