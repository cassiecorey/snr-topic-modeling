Govt playing catch-up on water policy, says Labor
Labor has attacked the Federal Government for not doing enough to prepare the country for drought.
The Prime Minister will hold a water crisis meeting with four state governments tomorrow to look at critical storage levels in the Murray Darling River system and the implications for irrigators.
The Murray Darling Basin received just 3.2 millimetres of rain last month, the lowest rainfall since records began.
Opposition agriculture and fisheries spokesman Gavan O'Connor says the Coalition is playing catch-up on policy.
"Labor proposed a summit on climate change and water some two years ago and that suggestion was met with derision by the Government," he said.
"Now with the Murray Darling Basin in a state of stress, systems not having enough water to meet farmers needs and some farmers allocations down to 30 per cent some not at all, the Government has decided to act. It's simply not good enough."
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGuaran says the current dry conditions are no-one's fault and steps have been taken to manage low water levels.
Irrigators from the Murray Darling Basin say environmental flows should be used to boost city water shortages.
The lobby group, Irrigators Australia Limited, has put forward a five point plan to the Federal Government looking at how to deal with the water crisis.
Chairman Barry Croke says governments should reduce water flows for the environment, instead of buying water off farmers.
"Irrigators' water is needed to feed people and we think that's very, very important but urban use when it starts competing with irrigation water in this time of real scarcity, it's creating an enormous problem to produce food," he said.
"So environmental water is there and normally the gum trees wouldn't be getting environmental water in this situation and we just believe urbans ought to be supplemented by environmental water."
