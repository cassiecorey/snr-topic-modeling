Vets push for foreign abattoir audits
The Australian Veterinary Association wants a grading system for overseas abattoirs, to better manage the welfare of exported livestock.
National president Dr Matt Makin says the treatment of Australian animals once they are unloaded in overseas ports is becoming an increasingly contentious part of the trade.
Cattle exports to Egypt were suspended earlier this year, after mistreatment concerns were raised.
Dr Makin says the Australian industry needs to take a greater role in managing animal welfare, not just in the lead up to and during export.
"We've been in heavy discussions with industry and with the Government to push the concept of facility audits overseas," he said.
