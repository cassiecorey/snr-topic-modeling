Australian dollar falls again amid low metal prices
The Australian dollar has fallen for the fourth consecutive day on the back of low precious and base metal prices.
The price of gold has dropped to around $US616 an ounce, in the biggest drop in seven weeks and a far cry from the month of May when it was trading at $US732.
The net effect is to drag down the Australian dollar, which is closely linked to mineral commodity performance.
