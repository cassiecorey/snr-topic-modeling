Burgess makes case to lead NFF
No surprises and no big policy changes is how prospective National Farmers' Federation (NFF) boss Allan Burgess, says he will lead the organisation if elected president.
Mr Burgess, NFF's trade representative, will contest next month's leadership ballot against former Meat and Livestock Australia boss David Crombie.
The Victorian says making sure farmers get a fair price for their produce and maintain a good relationship with urban Australia are key issues.
He says bringing Western Australia and South Australia back into the NFF fold is also high on his list of priorities.
"At the very highest priority for Allan Burgess in any organisation he's ever been a part of has been about getting a collective view," he said.
"In my experience farm organisations only work well when you can come to one consensus.
