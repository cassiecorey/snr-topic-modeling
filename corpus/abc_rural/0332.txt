McGauran denies breaking promise over fruit code of conduct
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has been accused of breaking an election promise, by not including the big supermarkets in a mandatory code of conduct for the fruit and vegetable sector.
Despite concerns within his own party, Mr McGauran is expected to take the code to Cabinet tomorrow.
National Party backbenchers say the Government is not delivering on what it promised.
In a statement during the election former leader John Anderson said the code would give producers a fairer deal on terms of trade and in resolving disputes with produce buyers, who are in many instances large supermarket chains.
Member for Mallee John Forrest says the Government may as well not have the code at all if it does not include the big retailers.
"To leave them out isn't delivering what we said we would deliver," he said.
The Government also faces a legal challenge from wholesale markets who are included in the code.
Central Markets Association spokesman Andrew Young says the current plan gives supermarkets an unfair advantage over market wholesalers.
"It should be workable and right now we're facing something which in many respects doesn't meet any of those criteria," he said.
But Mr McGauran denies he is breaking an election promise and says the code was never meant to include retailers like Coles and Woolworths.
He says the real problems for growers occur when they send produce to market wholesalers.
"Retailers were never part of the election commitment which was written down," he said.
