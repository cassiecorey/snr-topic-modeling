Court ruling delays Cole inquiry findings
The Cole inquiry into wheat exporter AWB is now not expected to deliver its findings until September or October.
AWB's Federal Court action over privileged documents is the reason for the delay.
Although AWB lost its fight to keep the "apology" document confidential, it has kept fighting to keep some 2000 other documents from public scrutiny.
Earlier this month the wheat exporter launched legal action to get the Federal Court to decide the privilege status of the documents, including those of its own internal inquiry into oil-for-food dealings.
Yesterday's hearings in the Federal Court ruled AWB had the right to get the court to decide the legal status of the documents, because their case preceded the increased powers of Commissioner Cole.
