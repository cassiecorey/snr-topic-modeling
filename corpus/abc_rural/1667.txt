Next phase of fishing industry buyout set to begin
The next stage of the national fishing industry buyout commences tomorrow.
Fishing towns are invited to apply for a share of $40 million, to assist them if they are affected by the buyout of 400 fishing licences.
Businesses can seek up to $100,000 each to close down or a quarter of a million dollars to redevelop.
Federal Fisheries Minister Eric Abetz says individual businesses and communities have until January 12 to apply for grants.
"Business that can no longer operate at all - they can apply for the business exit assistance, for those that say 'we can be still be viable if we can tweak our business but we need some assistance' well we've got the business development assistance," he said.
"For communities at large, come up with ideas as to how they might be able to develop something which will provide alternate employment then we're willing to assist those communities as well."
Meanwhile, the Australian Conservation Foundation has called for a worldwide ban on the sale of patagonian toothfish.
The call comes after the New South Wales District Court fined two crew members of a Cambodian-registered ship more than $100,000 for illegally taking the toothfish.
Denise Boyd, from the Conservation Foundation, says the penalty is insufficient and shows that the fishery can not be effectively managed.
"By shutting the fishery down and therefore having no legal product on the market it basically means that any product that does turn up on the market clearly does come from illegal, unreported and unregulated sources," she said.
