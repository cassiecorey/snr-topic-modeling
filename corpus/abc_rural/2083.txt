CBH awaits board approval for Broken Hill mine
A new zinc, lead and silver mine has been given the go-ahead at Broken Hill, in outback New South Wales, that should lead to 90 new jobs.
Sydney-based CBH Resources plans to start work in January opening up an unmined ore body within the famous line of lode.
But general manager of the Rasp mine, Visko Suluchich, says the company board still needs to approve the project.
