Ag machinery company folds
A South Australian agricultural machinery business is the latest victim of the drought.
Heaslip Products has gone into voluntary liquidation after operating for 100 years.
Managing director Joff Bound says the company has endured previous droughts but sales this year have have completely dried up.
"The company doesn't have a market because our customer hasn't got any money to buy new machines and he's going to have a bit of debt to repay probably after this drought disappears," he said.
