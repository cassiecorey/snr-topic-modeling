States debate Murray River funding allocation
There has finally been some progress in efforts to establish a national water trading system.
The eastern states appear to be trying to settle their differences over the future of water at a meeting of the Murray Darling Ministerial Council in Melbourne.
The council is also debating how to carve up an extra $500 million in federal funding to improve the environmental health of the Murray River.
While there is yet to be a national agreement on how water may be bought back by government into the Murray system, the states are making some progress of their own.
Victoria and NSW have reached an in-principle deal to trade water which may be up and running by the end of the year.
While the details of exit fees and other costs are yet to be worked out, both states have agreed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission should review any deal to make sure it is fair for all sides.
Victoria and South Australia had already an agreement on water trading prior to today's meeting.
Doug Miell from the New South Wales Irrigators Council, says the state has managed to convince Victoria and South Australia of the merits of a system of tagged trading.
"We've got the water that Victoria and South Australia have really got their eyes on, so it's simply a case of he who has the gold makes the rules," he said.
