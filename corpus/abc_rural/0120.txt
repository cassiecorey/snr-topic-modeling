AWB pool returns up
To the grains market and wheat exporter AWB has lifted its expected pool returns for the 2006-07 season by $5 a tonne.
It is also expecting an increase in returns for 2004-05 because of a lower Aussie dollar.
The National Party wants to set targets for ending the flow of urban waste water into the ocean and increasing the use of recycled water in both cities and rural areas.
The Nationals research arm, the Page Research Centre, will conduct a study into recycled water to see if reused water could help attract and keep industries to regional centres.
Chair of the study, Queensland Nationals president, Bruce Scott says there needs to be greater debate on community attitudes to recycled water.
"What I do know is that there are so many communities that are on water restrictions almost year round now and there are communities in regional areas that are unable to attract new industries to those towns because they don't have any water to offer those industries," Mr Scott said.
