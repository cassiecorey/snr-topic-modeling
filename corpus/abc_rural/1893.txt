New drought relief package not enough: irrigators
Irrigators say new Victorian Government drought relief does not go far enough.
The Victorian Government has announced a $5,000 rebate for farmers who received less than 50 per cent of their water allocation.
Farmers still pay water authorities even when they do not receive water, due to the cost of maintaining irrigation channels.
Chair of the Northern Victorian Irrigators, Dudley Bryant, says with most large dairy and cropping farms paying bills around $30,000, the Government's offer will only make a small difference.
"They have recognised there's a problem there," he said.
"They have actually said now that they'll pick up the cost of water even though there may be a lot of small hobby farmers and whatever, and I'm not trying to say they should or shouldn't be in it but they are.
