Wool growers urged to keep research levy
Wool producers are being urged not to lodge a protest vote against maintaining the 2 per cent levy which funds research, development and marketing by Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
With plans afoot to merge AWI with Australian Wool Services (AWS), some growers are worried their funds will be used to pay a $27 million debt owed by AWS in the United Kingdom.
Chairman of WoolPoll 2006 John Keniry understands growers are hurting from the drought and low wool prices, but says cutting the levy will create new problems.
"Zero per cent means that there is no levy income," he said.
"If there is no levy income from growers then there is also no contribution from the Federal Government and that means there is no ongoing income for AWI.
"AWI would spend the reserves it has simply to finish off the contracts that are currently in place and then turn out the light, which, from my personal view as a wool grower, would be a sad event if we just walked away from research altogether."
The WoolPoll vote closes on November 3.
The wool market remained steady this week, the eastern market indicator up just one cent to 742 cents per kilogram.
The market remained unchanged in the west.
