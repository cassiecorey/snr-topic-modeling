Harvesting short crops challenges grain growers
Grain growers in Western Australia struggling with the dry season are now facing with another challenge, harvesting short crops.
Glen Riethmuller from the Department of Agriculture says farmers in the reliable cropping areas are not used to having such light crops.
He says growers are experimenting with different ways to set up their harvesters, so they can reduce losses.
"People have certainly been looking at that knife and particularly changing to the double density knife guards if they haven't already got them," he said.
