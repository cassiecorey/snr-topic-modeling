Court asked to streamline AWI case
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) has asked the Federal Court to streamline its case against the animal rights group PETA.
The peak wool body wants the claims of 101 woolgrowers heard separately, leaving AWI, Elders Limited and BWK Elders Australia to go to trial against PETA and Animal Liberation New South Wales.
AWI started its case against PETA in November 2004 and joined the woolgrowers to the action in March, 2005.
AWI's counsel told Justice Rares his client proposed corralling the woolgrowers separately for efficiency reasons to streamline the case.
But PETA's barrister Michael Jones said this would prejudice his client because PETA wanted access to the farmers' contracts for sale of wool, financial records and mulesing information.
