SAFF seeks help to boost membership
South Australia's peak farming body wants farmers to help boost membership levels.
Only 65 farmers made the trip to a public workshop in Adelaide today to help redirect the South Australian Farmers Federation (SAFF) into the future.
SAFF is asking farmers across the state to come up with ideas to make the organisation more relevant particularly to younger farmers.
The organisation's membership is falling there are currently 4,000 members while there were 11,000 back in the 1980's.
