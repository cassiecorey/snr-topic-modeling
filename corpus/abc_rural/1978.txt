Rebound in wool prices expected to continue
Wool prices are tipped to rise even further as competition for Australia's drought-depleted wool stocks grows between Europe and Asia.
Wools in the medium 21 to 23 micron range are at a five year high after jumping up to 44 cents a kilogram at yesterday's sales.
Over the past three weeks the benchmark eastern market indicator has risen to a two-year-high.
Chief economist at Woolmark Chris Wilcos says the rebound should continue for at least another two months.
"We would expect to see a further rise of 10 to 15 per cent again, compared with what we've already seen in the last three weeks," he said.
