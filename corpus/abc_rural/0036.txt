NZ shearers break work record
A team of New Zealand shearers has broken the world three-stand lamb shearing record
Jimmy Clarke and Peter and Shane Harvey shore 2,350 lambs in nine hours at Mt Linton Station on the South Island yesterday, breaking the record by 400 head.
Peter Harvey says he has always wanted to shear 700 head a day and has now achieved that goal but did not realise how hard it would be.
