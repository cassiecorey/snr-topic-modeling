Possibilities for GM cotton raised at conference
Northern Australian irrigators and researchers have not given up on genetically modified cotton.
The crop has been excluded from the Ord Valley, by the Western Australian Government, and is banned in the Northern Territory.
But growers attending a national irrigation conference in Darwin want to plant it.
Researcher John Moulden says trials have proven GM cotton uses less water than existing Ord Valley crops like sugar cane and bananas.
"We are not advocating cotton as the be all and end all for the Ord, it's just one of the options we feel farmers in the Ord really need and deserve," he said.
"There's no scientific or environmental reason why GM cotton shouldn't be grown in northern Australia - the issues have been extensively addressed.
