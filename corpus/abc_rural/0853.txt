Tas fox population confirmed: report
A new report has found there are definitely foxes in Tasmania and they pose a multi-million dollar threat to the State's agricultural sector.
Despite a number of reported sightings since a state task force was set up three years ago, the existence of foxes in Tasmania has remained an open question.
But main author of the new report, Glenn Saunders, says there is no doubt that a small population exists.
"I guess we came in as an external group and looked at it impartially," he said.
"We had nothing to gain or benefit from concluding one way or the other, but on reviewing all of the available evidence that we could gather, and I mean all of the available evidence not just snippets of it here and there, we really couldn't come to any other conclusion."
And if they find the Tassie foxes, there is a market for them.
A fox skin buyer and exporter says demand and prices for Australian fox skins are rising after years of disinterest from the trade.
The trade declined and prices plummeted during the 1980s during a bitter campaign waged by animal liberation groups against the use of fur in fashion.
A large number of fox shooters stopped taking skins and the skill of skinning, and preparing the pelts, almost died out.
But fox skin exporter Don McGilvray says renewed Chinese interest in fur is leading the trade's recovery.
"I'm paying from $25 for the tops and the averages are anywhere from 13 to $16," he said.
