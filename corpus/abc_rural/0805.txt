Dairy farmers get animal welfare information kits
Dairy farmers around Australia are being sent kits in the mail, containing information about animal welfare practices.
The kit, from Australian Dairy Farmers Limited, aims to inform the wider community, rather than the farmers, about the industry's standards.
Wes Judd, from Australian Dairy Farmers, says it help dairy farmers stand up against critics in the community.
"We feel we have a huge resource in our producers around Australia and we want to give them the information," he said.
