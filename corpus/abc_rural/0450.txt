Wool prices expected to pick up
A new report says wool prices are about to climb again, despite seven weeks of losses.
The eastern market indicator is 46 cents per kilogram below the seasonal high recorded in March.
The latest business survey from marketing body Woolmark says the fall was inevitable, with not enough demand to support high prices.
But with stronger orders coming through from China, western Europe and East Asia, Woolmark economist Kerry Stott says prices will pick up through the June quarter.
"It's the best it's been in almost five years," he said.
"The really good thing is that it's more widespread geographically than in the past and not only that, it seems to be more widespread right through from combing through to weaving.
"And I think if people look at what's happening to our prices in US dollars, and see that our prices are still going up in US dollars, they'd be pleasantly surprised."
The eastern market indicator closed at 708 cents a kilo clean on Friday.
Woolmark's prediction is being backed by some analysts.
Elders Queensland wool manager Maurie McNeill expects a decent recovery based on price indications out of China.
"We can probably see 20 per cent retracement of the losses that we've seen in this market over the last four or five weeks, particularly in the finer end of the market," he said.
