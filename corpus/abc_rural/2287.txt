Milk production expected to drop
The dairy industry is expecting a big drop in milk production next year as farmers struggle to meet high feed prices, particularly in non drought-declared areas.
Although milk processors are negotiating better farm gate prices and offering interest free loans, farmers are having major problems securing reliable feed deliveries.
Dairy consultant Bill Naughtin says some farmers are not milking as much.
"I have heard on the grapevine that some people have decided to go once a day in an effort to reduce water use, but most people I have spoken to have a plan in place to feed their animals," he said.
"The principal concern at the moment is where are they going to get the money to pay for the feed and how are they going to access feed that's reasonable quality and reliable."
