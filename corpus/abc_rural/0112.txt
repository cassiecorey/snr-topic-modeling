Rain sets back fight against noxious weed
While pastoralists in Western Australia's Pilbara region are rapt with the wet start to the year, record rainfall has resulted in a growing problem with noxious weeds.
Mesquite is a weed with spiny thorns and covers 150,000 hectares of grazing land west of Karratha.
Linda Anderson from the Pilbara Mesquite Management Committee says the rain has put the fight against the weed back a number of years.
"It's now going to germinate a lot of the seed bank that we think that was there that we haven't seen germinate in probably the last six or seven years when we haven't had rain," she said.
