Timbercorp, Costas launch Chiquita takeover bid
Agri-investment company Timbercorp has announced it is involved in a take-over bid for mushroom and fruit marketing company Chiquita Brands South Pacific.
For the bid, Timbercorp has joined forces with the Costa family to form a company called Tradefresh, which has offered 73 cents per share to buy out Chiquita.
The Costa group already owns 26 per cent of Chiquita shares.
If the bid is successful Timbercorp would end up with a 35 per cent share in Chiquita and the Costa family the remaining 65 per cent.
Bananas only represent about 15 per cent of Chiquita's normal annual turnover and before cyclone Larry the company marketed about 12 per cent of all bananas sold in Australia.
Mushrooms are Chiquita's biggest commodity making up about 35 to 40 per cent of its annual turnover, some from the Stanthorpe area in south-east Queensland.
Chiquita managing director Mano Babiolakis says he has only just heard about this takeover bid so he has advised shareholders not to take any action until it has been carefully assessed.
Timbercorp is a specialist investment management company involved in the Australian horticulture and forestry industries.
Timbercorp's deputy CEO Sol Rabinowicz believes Chiquita would be a sensible addition to their portfolio.
"Both we and Costas believe that there's an opportunity to join together the strength of the Costa group as one of Australia's leaders in fresh produce, farm management, packing, processing and marketing together with Chiquita's strengths as a category manager particularly in the area like berries, mushrooms and citrus," he said.
"We think that it can sit together, they can become a more efficient operator."
