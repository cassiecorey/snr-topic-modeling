Trucking companies to pass on increased fuel costs
The transport industry will start passing on the increased cost of fuel this week as companies begin to include fuel surcharges in contracts.
The Australian Trucking Association (ATA) has been urging operators to act for some time, especially smaller businesses who are struggling to absorb the higher diesel costs.
The ATA's Stuart St Clair says he is relieved at the industry's decision and believes most customers have been expecting it.
"I think the majority of customers would understand because they'd be under some similar price pressures themselves, particularly those that have a lot of vehicles on the road, whether they be stock and station agents or whether they be farmers or others," he said.
