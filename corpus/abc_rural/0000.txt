PM denies knowledge of AWB kickbacks
The Prime Minister has denied he knew AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq despite writing to the wheat exporter asking to be kept fully informed on Iraq wheat sales.
Letters from John Howard and Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile to AWB have been released by the Cole inquiry into the oil for food program.
In one of the letters Mr Howard asks AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg to remain in close contact with the Government on Iraq wheat sales.
The Opposition's Gavan O'Connor says the letter was sent in 2002, the same time AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq though a Jordanian trucking company.
He says the Government can longer wipe its hands of the illicit payments, which totalled $290 million.
"The responsibility for this must lay may squarely at the feet of Coalition ministers in trade, agriculture and the Prime Minister," he said.
But the Prime Minister says letters show he was inquiring about the future of wheat sales in Iraq and do not prove the Government knew of the payments.
"It would have been astonishing in 2002 if as Prime Minister I hadn't done anything I possibly could to preserve Australia's very valuable wheat market," he said.
