Sniffer dogs to hunt cane toads
Sniffer dogs trained to smell out cane toads will soon be introduced in north-west Australia.
Tenders have been called by Western Australia's Department of Conservation and Land Management for canine training.
The department is looking for a hardy dog to withstand the tropical conditions and regional manager Gae Mckay says it will be trialed in the scrub this dry season.
"Obviously it has to be a dog that's trainable and in particular with the cane toads we want to make it a field ready dog, so it's not just a matter of sitting sniffing luggage and so forth," she said.
