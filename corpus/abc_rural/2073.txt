Shearers spin yarns at WA reunion
Shearing teams from the 1960s have spent the weekend reliving tales, at the fourth WA Shearers' Reunion near Perth.
The event is to keep alive a part of the state's agricultural history, since the demise of the old shearing teams which spent months on end travelling through the Pilbara and Kimberley.
Don Mercer, 80, was a shearing contractor from Wagin.
"The first year I was running a shearing team I had a shearer who got quite drunk and decided that he'd fire a couple of shots into my room while I was in it," he said.
