US beef processor banned from exporting to Hong Kong
US meat exports to Asia have been dealt another blow, with a major processor banned from exporting beef to Hong Kong.
A shipment of Cargill beef was found to contain fragments of bone in contravention of export regulations designed to prevent the spread of mad cow disease.
Chief market analyst at Meat and Livestock Australia Peter Weeks says the news will not affect Japan but the latest controversy could delay the resumption of US exports to Korea.
"But outside of Hong Kong is far more significant particularly in Korea where they have linked their reopening, the timing of their reopening to instances, to the previous instance as well as the third BSE case in the US and the circumstances surrounding that," he said.
