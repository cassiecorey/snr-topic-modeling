Ploughmen dig in at championships
Twenty of Australia's best ploughmen battled for first place at the weekend's National Ploughing Championships in Tasmania.
Pitting their technical precision against the clock, farmers also had to work in dense fog while competing at Cressy, in the state's north.
Two Victorians were the winners, Adrian Tilling for conventional ploughing, and David Smith for reversible ploughing, and both will represent Australia at the world titles next year.
Rhonda Smith from the World Plough Organisation says success all depends on the day.
"Ploughmen can plough good on one day and draw a good plot and then some ploughmen can plough under pressure," she said.
