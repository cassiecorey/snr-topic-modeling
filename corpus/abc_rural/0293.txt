Fruit fly outbreak could affect Tas market access
A fruit fly outbreak has been detected at the Northern Territory's largest table grape producer.
The central Australian town of Ti-Tree reported an isolated outbreak last month but recent tests now show the pest has spread to nearby Territory Grapes.
Horticulture advisory officer Geoff Kenna says the finding could affect market access to Tasmania.
