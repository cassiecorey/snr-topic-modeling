Grain storage
Meanwhile unusually high levels of grain are in storage around the country.
The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures show more than 13 million tonnes of wheat, barley and other feed grains are currently held by bulk storage companies and grain handlers.
Karen Connaughton from the ABS says the numbers are boosted from last year's bumper harvest.
"This is the first time that we've done this collection since December 2004 so we have no previous data to compare with," she said.
"But what people need to remember is that the 2005-06 harvest was almost a record high harvest.
