Qld's finest cattle on show at Ekka
The who's who of Queensland's cattle industry is at one place today - at the Brisbane Ekka.
The Ekka is playing host to one of the nation's most prestigious cattle competitions.
The cattle are bringing good prices at today's auction.
Numbers are down a little at the Ekka prime cattle competition this year, numbers of cattle that is, but there are certainly plenty of people.
Between 200-300 have gathered around to hear how much Queensland's meat processors are prepared to pay for the cream of Queensland's fat cattle.
Already the grand champion pen of six limousin, exhibited by Eddie Nolan from southern Queensland, has made 250 cents per kilogram liveweight.
Grand champion steer of the show, another limousin, made 305 cents a kilo.
