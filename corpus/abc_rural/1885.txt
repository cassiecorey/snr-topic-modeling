30,000 cattle imported to Indonesia for Ramadan
At least 30,000 imported cattle have been sold across Indonesia for the Islamic festival of Ramadan.
The last fast will be broken this evening and the food festivities begin with prayer tomorrow morning.
Greg Pankhurst from Agrogiri Perkasa, the largest importer of Australian cattle, says he expects 20,000 cattle will be sold in the coming days.
But he says feedlot sales have still been slower this year.
"We haven't been run off our feet in any way," Mr Pankhurst said.
"We have gone from our traditional 100 a day to 200 a day, which is normal.
"So I have 100 per cent increase in sale but the next three or four days we won't sell anything because most people have their meat stocks in hand.
"Traditionally after Labaran, which is tomorrow and Wednesday we will see a little bit of an increase over and above our normal sales. So we will probably sell about 120 to 140 a day."
