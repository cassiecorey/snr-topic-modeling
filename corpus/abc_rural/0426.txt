Govt holiday workers scheme to be extended
A scheme to use backpackers to ease labour shortages in the horticulture and cropping sectors is being extended to cover livestock, forestry and fishing.
From July, holiday makers who work for three months in jobs like shearing, stock handling and pearling will be able to apply for a second 12 month visa.
The Federal Government will also double the length of time backpackers can work for one employer - from three to six months.
The National Farmers Federation's Denita Wawn says producers would prefer to employ local workers but there are not enough people willing to work in regional Australia.
"At NFF certainly it is our preference that we can [use] locals to work in these jobs but experience shows that people, a lot of people simply aren't interested in working in agriculture," she said.
But some primary industries are highly critical of the changes.
The Territory's pearling industry says the increase to six month work placements will not solve labour shortages, because that's still not long enough to cover the cost of induction and training.
The Horticultural Association says the extension will benefit the nursery, pruning and packing industries but spokeswoman Tracey Leo says there could be a big impact on the mango harvest.
"We are seeing a thinning of the available labour pool. So in short I guess we are now going into competition with industries that we may not have been competing for labour with before," she said.
"In our high volume years, they [foreign workers] are a significant portion of our labour force.
