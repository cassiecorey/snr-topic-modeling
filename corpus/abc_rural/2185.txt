Dry conditions to blame for slump in farmers' confidence
The confidence of Australian farmers has slumped to its lowest level in six years.
The state of mind in rural Australia been revealed in the latest Rabobank Rural Confidence Survey.
Just 15 per cent of farmers expect the rural economy to pick up over the coming 12 months compared with 19 per cent last quarter.
The states hardest hit are Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia.
Rabobank's head of rural banking, Neil Dobbin, says ongoing dry conditions are largely to blame.
"This is the lowest confidence farmers have had since the survey started, which is six years ago. Sixty-five per cent of the farmers thought that income would worsen over the next 12 months," Mr Dobbin said.
