Meat industry concerned over skilled worker visa delay
The Australian Meat Industry Council will meet the Federal Immigration and Agriculture ministers this week to try to sort out problems with the skilled workers visa program.
Currently, the Immigration Department is not processing applications for skilled workers under the 457 visa program because of concerns some employers are breeching the visa conditions.
Australian Meat Industry Council chief executive, Kevin Cottrell, says delays in processing visa applications for overseas meat workers are creating a nightmare for the industry.
