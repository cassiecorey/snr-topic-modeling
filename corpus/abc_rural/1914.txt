Cherries make $55,000 for charity
A record $55,000 has been paid for two boxes of the season's first cherries at a charity auction in Sydney.
They were bought by the owner of a chain of fruit shops in Sydney and will be distributed to children in hospital.
Cherry Growers president Ian Hay says there was fierce competition to supply the charity box between growers from Griffith in New South Wales and the South Australian Riverland.
"They actually had a competition in the central markets to get the best box of cherries and they couldn't split between these two cases so they actually put up two cases," he said.
