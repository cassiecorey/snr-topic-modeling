Dairy farmers form collective bargaining group
Tasmanian dairy farmers who supply food giant National Foods have formed the state's first collective bargaining group.
About 30 farmers have come together to negotiate future supply and price contracts.
The chairman of the group, Kem Perkins says the move was inevitable.
"It's the only way we could go to negotiate a price because under the rules and the law these days you can't negotiate price as an individual," he said.
"You can't even put in on the agenda when you have a suppliers' group meeting so the way we've set it up ... means that we can talk to any company, negotiate with any company and we can take on board any suppliers that conform to the conditions."
One of the first jobs for the bargaining group will be to negotiate extra time for next season's price talks.
