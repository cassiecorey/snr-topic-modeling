ATV industry working on safety standards
Motorcycle companies say they are creating a national safety standard for four-wheel all-terrain bikes.
There have been concerns for some years about the number of crashes involving all-terrain vehicles (ATVs).
The New South Wales Coroner is investigating the latest, the death of a 55-year-old rider on a farm on the Monaro in New South Wales.
Yamaha safety lawyer Kelly Stallard says the industry is working on standards, a code of practice, and educating riders.
"The ATV industry is very concerned with occupational health and safety issues," she said.
"We are finalising an industry code of practice for users, particularly farmers, on the safe use of these machines.
