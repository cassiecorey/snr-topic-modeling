Cole inquiry hears from ex-UN customs official
The Cole inquiry has reconvened in Sydney to hear the evidence of former UN customs official Felicity Johnston.
Ms Johnston has told the inquiry she informed Australian Government officials in both Washington and New York about inland transport fees being paid by AWB to the Iraqi Government.
Ms Johnston appeared at the inquiry via video link from Washington.
She told senior counsel assisting John Agius she mentioned the inland transportation payments in discussion with DFAT's delegate at the Australian mission to the UN, Bronte Moules and with AusTrade Commissioner Alistair Nicholas.
Ms Johnston said she raised the issue in January and March 2000 following a complaint from the Canadians.
