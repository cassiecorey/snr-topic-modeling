Key witness to front Cole inquiry
The Cole inquiry examining AWB's role in the oil-for-food scandal has been adjourned to a date to be fixed after hearing evidence last week from John Howard, Alexander Downer and Mark Vaile.
But there is at least one key witness still to come.
With public hearings all but finalised before Easter, senior counsel assisting John Agius informed Commissioner Terence Cole he would require him to sit again for several days after Anzac Day.
Mr Agius told the inquiry he was making arrangements for a witness to appear before the commission.
He later confirmed that witness to be Felicity Johnston, who worked for the UN's Office of Iraq program.
Mr Agius says the commission has obtained clearance from the United Nations but is still going through necessary protocols with the British Foreign Office.
