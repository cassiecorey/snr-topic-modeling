Author predicts new direction for wheat exports
The author of a new book looking at AWB's governance, says there is mounting pressure from grain growers to completely deregulate Australia's wheat export market.
Under the present system, AWB operates the single desk and has the right to veto bulk export applications from any other company.
But director of Australia's National Institute for Governance Stephen Bartos believes that will have to change.
And for the first time, the east coast producer group, the Grains Growers Association, has outlined its vision for the future of wheat exports.
