Cooler change disrupts cows' milk production
A cold snap across south-eastern Australia is even affecting the cows at Hamilton, in Tasmania's Derwent Valley.
With temperatures plunging to minus three degrees celsius, and even minus 5.8 degrees celsius overnight on Tuesday, the dairy cows on Dave Jones' farm have dropped a litre-and-a-half of milk a day.
He says frozen machinery is causing long delays in milking, disrupting the cows' regular milking and pasture routines.
"For the last three or four mornings we've tarped the whole dairy in and we've got a little bit of a heater in there which warms it up by about a degree, but for the last three mornings we've spent the first two to three hours defrosting the machines and getting all the electronics working," Mr Jones said.
