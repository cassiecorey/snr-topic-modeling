Mango industry to target young families
Research has revealed mango lovers are an ageing population, with more than 60 per cent of consumers aged over 40.

"Young people are often busy like all of us and often don't have time and want something quick and fast, and that's why you see fast food restaurants become so popular," he said.
"Traditionally mangoes have been seen as messy to eat, something you had to actually cut and prepare and it takes time.
