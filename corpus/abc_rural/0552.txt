Thousands expected to flock to Fred's Show
The first agricultural show of the year in the Top End is expected to attract 30,000 people through the gates this weekend.
Equestrian events are already under way south of Darwin at the four-day Fred's Pass Rural Show.
Last year 29,500 walked through the gates of the showgrounds, which are nestled amongst five acre rural blocks on Darwin City's southern outskirts.
And this year, a steer auction is being held for the first time and the Territory's Cowboys Association is hoping to draw big crowds to the two days of rodeo.
The hay-stacking event is one of the most competitive and the Tasmanian woodchoppers will showcase their talents for the 18th time.
