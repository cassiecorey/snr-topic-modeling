Cold fronts bring rain to north WA
A series of cold fronts has brought good rains to much of Western Australia's parched farming and pastoral regions.
Falls have even reached areas of the Pilbara in the state's north, not known to receive rain at this time of year.
Further south in agricultural regions, crops and pastures have been given a healthy boost with falls of between 10 and 30 millimetres over drought-affected areas of the eastern and central wheatbelt.
Mukinbudin farmer Chris Geraghty says the rain has been enough to bring some crops back to life and will improve pastures.
"Feed's been pretty good early on because of the summer rain but the last few weeks, it's starting to go off a bit," he said.
