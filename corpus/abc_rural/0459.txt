Water costs to push commodity prices up
A national conference has heard rising water costs will push some irrigators out of primary production.
The Irrigation Association of Australia's conference in Brisbane has also heard high water costs will push up commodity prices.
Chief executive Jolyon Burnett says some irrigators face rises of up to 4,000 per cent, as water authorities move to recover more of the delivery costs.
"It is important that we attach a more realistic value to water and that there be signals, if you like, to the growers to value that water and to improve their efficiency."
Despite the rising costs, Professor Paul Perkins from the Australian National University predicts Australia will be one of the few countries in the world with enough water to grow its own food in 25 years time.
He says it is a great opportunity to expand exports.
"The global water shortage is much worse than the Australian water, so-called water crisis," he said.
