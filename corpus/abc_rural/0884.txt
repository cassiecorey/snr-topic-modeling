Egg industry seeks to boost sales
The egg industry has launched a push to get more people eating eggs, after figures show Australia has the lowest rate of consumption of eggs in the western world.
On average we eat 169 eggs each per year, a long way below the Japanese, who eat 350, or the Americans, who consume 260 eggs each.
James Kellaway from the Australian Egg Corporation also says that while Australians are offered a wider choice of eggs, most are buying cage industry products.
"Just over 80 per cent of Australia's production is represented in caged eggs and that has a price point attached to it which is relatively lower than that price point attached to barn-laid or free-range eggs," Mr Kellaway said.
