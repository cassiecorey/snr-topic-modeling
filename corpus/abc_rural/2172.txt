Prospect for rain improves
The National Climate Centre says a duel between sea temperatures in the Pacific and Indian oceans could bring slightly higher rainfall to much of Australia.
Indian Ocean temperatures are rising off Western Australia and up to Indonesia, cancelling out a worsening El Nino effect in the Pacific Ocean.
There is now a 50 per cent chance of average rainfall across most of Australia in the next three months, although north Queensland could be drier.
Senior climatologist Lyn Bettio says the prospect of rain certainly has not got any worse.
"It's actually looking better than what it was last month," she said.
