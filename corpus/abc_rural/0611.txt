Vets call for regulation of animal welfare debate
The Australian Veterinary Association says governments must regulate how the animal welfare debate is presented to children.
It is critical of a campaign being run by animal rights group Voiceless, which encourages school children to speak out against issues like live exports and factory farming, saying its biased and threatens farming livelihoods.
President, Dr Matt Makin says children should be exposed to the debate, but is questioning what he says are extremist views from both sides.
"You know this is also a responsibility for governments who are in charge of school curriculums," he said.
"They need to, you know, be ensuring that children are exposed to all the facts on both sides of the debate so that the younger generation can form their own opinion.
"And presenting them with one side of the debate, I think, if this Government doesn't do anything about that I think it's quite irresponsible."
