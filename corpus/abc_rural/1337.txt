Lamb industry thrives despite drought
Although the prime lamb industry is in its fifth year of severe drought, the number of new season lambs coming into the market is expected to rise another 3 per cent in the next 12 months.
Meat and Livestock Australia says that is due to a 16 per cent jump in second-cross lambs, which are produced for meat.
And there has been a dramatic fall in the price of cattle contracts on the Sydney Futures Exchange.
