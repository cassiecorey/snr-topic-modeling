Burning boat sends strong message to illegal fishers
An Indonesian fishing boat is being burnt in Darwin today - the 74th to be apprehended in Australian waters this year.
Earlier this year, the Navy seized the 'Harapan', which is an Indonesian type three ice boat, inside the Australian fishing zone boundary.
The 27 metre long boat could store up to 40 tonnes of fish, but this one was only carrying about 50 kilograms of fish such as snapper aided by GPS navigation.
The Australian Fisheries Management Authority says these boat burnings send a strong message to the owners in Indonesia, that illegal fishing will not be tolerated.
It has been set alight in a boat burn pit at Hudson Creek, near the busy East Arm Port of Darwin and will take all day to burn completely. Any metal remaining will be salvaged for cost recovery.
