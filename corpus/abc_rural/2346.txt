Fishing sector angry over marine park plan
Western Australia's commercial fishing sector is angry that is has not been consulted about new marine parks planned for the state's north-west.
The State Government will create the parks, as part of an attempt to protect the environment, once the $15 billion Gorgon gas field is developed on Barrow Island.
But Guy Leyland from the WA Fishing Industry Council says the $130 million sector was not told about the plans, and still knows little about what is proposed.
"We learnt about an hour before the public announcement by the Minister," he said.
"The Minister telephoned us and advised us that this is what the Government was going to do.
"It's just pointing to I think that we weren't consulted more closely in terms of the Government's intention.
