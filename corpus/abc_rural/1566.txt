Alice locals encouraged to pull weeds for fitness
A new sporting body in Alice Springs wants to help people become fit by helping the environment.
Enviro Sports Australia will try to encourage people to pull weeds for exercise.
President Adrian James says although it is an unusual combination, everyone is a winner.
"One event I'd like to get started in the not too distant future is something in some of the land around Alice, probably in the Todd River, in sections that are heavily infested with environmental weeds," he said.
