Low demand reduces NT pig market
Contract pig shooters in the Northern Territory are selling off their hunting dogs because they do not have an export market this year.
More than 20 registered shooters around the town of Katherine cull hundreds of feral pigs during the dry season and ship the meat to Germany.
But this year demand and prices are so low, not a single pig will be going overseas.
Hunter Athol Schmidt says it is bad news for the environment, because without an export market it is too expensive to hunt.
"At the moment the stuff that's coming out of Queensland and northern NSW is just filling the pet food market," Mr Schmidt said.
"The prices down south they opened up at 60 cents per kilo, they tell me they've gone to 80 but you're still flogging a dead horse.
