US abuzz about Aussie bees
Bee hives are being stolen from almond orchards in the United States, leading to a rapid growth in imports from Australia.
The bees are vital to pollinate the country's rapidly growing almond industry.
Barry Pobke from the South Australian Apiarist Association, says thousands of kilograms of bees could be exported every year.
