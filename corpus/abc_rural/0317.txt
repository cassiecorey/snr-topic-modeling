Landcare popularity wanes
While Landcare is approaching its 20th anniversary in Victoria, a new survey shows it is not as popular as it used to be.
Over the past six years, more than 4,000 Victorians have left the movement and the number of groups has also declined.
Survey author and director of the Institute for Land, Water and Society, Professor Allan Curtis, says there are a number of reasons why people are leaving.
