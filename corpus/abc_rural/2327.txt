Camels sold as weed eaters in Qld
Prices have fallen at Australia's third commercial camel sale but organisers say there is a growing market for using the animals as weed eaters.
Camel breeder Paddy McHugh has sold 67 camels under the hammer at the Gracemere saleyards in central Queensland.
He says while a few camels were bought to boost breeding numbers, most will have new jobs managing weeds.
"That's probably the most predominant use of them at the moment, is to eat the parkinsonia and prickly acacia and all the wattle regrowth," he said.
"They do a great job and they coexist with cattle - they've got all sorts of funny little things, the ruminant bug they pass on.
