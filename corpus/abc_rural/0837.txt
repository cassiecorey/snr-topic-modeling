New 'Team Dogging' event to feature in rodeo
This weekend's annual rodeo in the small far north Queensland town of Laura features a new event called 'Team Dogging'.
Organisers believe it is the first rodeo in Australia to have a bull-dogging competition with two horsemen leaping off to grab a bullock - one by the head, the other by the tail.
Laura rodeo secretary Karlene Shephard says the event evolved last year when the truckload of normal dogging steers did not turn up, so they used larger bullocks instead.
"[The] fellas went through and drafted off the ones that had a little bit of horn that was there and put them in the dogging box," she said.
"When the first fella went in he looked at it and he said 'gee they're a bit big' because they were bullocks and they were flat out fitting in the dogging box and anyway another fella off the committee said 'why don't two of you have a go at it'.
