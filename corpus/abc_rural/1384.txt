MLA apologises for hacking tagging poll
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) has been forced to apologise, after two staff members hacked into an Internet poll on the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS).
The Rural Press poll asked readers to rate the performance of the system to trace animals from birth to death.
Early poll results showed more than 60 per cent of voters described NLIS as poor or terrible.
But a day later, after tampering by MLA staff, the poll showed 70 per cent believed the system was good or excellent.
MLA's managing director, David Palmer, says the staff involved have not been sacked.
He concedes the organisation's credibility is on the line.
"This is a very damaging moment. I take it very seriously, the company takes it very seriously, the board equally are most alarmed and shocked by it," he said.
"We will take all steps and measures to set us down a track to try to win back that integrity and win back that credibility that we just so desperately need from industry."
A long-time critic of NLIS, the Australian Beef Association, says the incident does nothing to boost the credibility of electronic identification.
It says the incident backs its claims the system can be easily corrupted.
Chairwoman Linda Hewitt says Mr Palmer should immediately sack the MLA staff involved.
"Possibly the man did not know what was going on, possibly he is very embarrassed, but he certainly needs to take very strong action straight away," she said.
"We will be keeping an eye on the situation.
"We will be putting press releases out about how we expect the whole situation to be handled and we will be questioning the integrity of the MLA's checking of itself."
