Transport industry fears higher fuel costs amid Mid East crisis
The transport sector is bracing for even higher fuel prices, as a result of the escalating crisis in the Middle East.
Analysts say it is only a matter of time before crude oil hits $US100 a barrel, leading to bowser prices of about $2 a litre.
Luke Fraser from the Livestock Transporters Association says trucking operators are already finding it hard to break even, and they will have to pass on the increased costs, with flow-on affects for the farming and export sectors.
"It is going to be difficult, but I think that more than that it is probably going to affect the whole meat and livestock chain and indeed grains and anything else that is being carried in the bush," he said.
