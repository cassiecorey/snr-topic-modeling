'Santa' drops in on remote stations
Planes flying to remote stations are being loaded with hundreds of kilograms of presents in the lead-up to Christmas.
Alice Springs-based Chart Air has flown to up to 60 properties across the Northern Territory this week to deliver mail.
Pilot John Zonaras says he has been re-named Santa because half his mailbags contain gifts.
"The mail and that sort of stuff has definitely increased in volume," he said.
"Like today I had a mail run with 42 mailbags and about 350 kilograms so probably a good 150 kilograms of it was presents.
