Results on mad cow disease research may take years
Scientists say it could take years to work out whether there is a new strain of mad cow disease or whether the original virus has mutated.
US researchers have confirmed that two cases of BSE in Texas and Alabama during the past year are a new variety of the disease, which is similar to others in Europe and Japan.
Professor Colin Masters from Melbourne University says it is frustrating for agricultural industries which have to wait for the research before finding out whether they can stop any further spread of the disease.
"So far they're very rare and they've only been found because of this massively increased surveillance," he said.
