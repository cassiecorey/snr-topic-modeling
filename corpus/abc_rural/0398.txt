Skilled migrants' minimum wage may hurt business
Meat processors say the Federal Government's decision to set a new minimum wage for temporary migrant workers will hurt regional businesses.
Workers on temporary visas will have to be paid a minimum of $42,000 a year after unions claimed local jobs were being undercut.
The Federal Government says the decision is to help Australia compete against other nations in the fight to attract employees.
Kevin Cottrill from the Meat Industry Council says while it will not stop employers from taking on migrant workers, it will add to costs.
"The big risk I guess is that the expectation of current employees and of unions is that there might be a 7 per cent increase across the board in wages, that would be the big danger," he said.
"We're looking at something in excess of 7 per cent which is a substantial increase given the current rates of inflation so it will certainly have an affect on the costs of the industry."
