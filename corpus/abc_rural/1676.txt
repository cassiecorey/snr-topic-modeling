Poor season
In WA, the poor season is being blamed for a 23 per cent fall in the number of livestock entered in this year's Royal Agricultural Show which starts in Perth this weekend.
The Royal Agricultural Society's Deane Allen says many farmers will spend their money on livestock feed, rather than taking animals to the show.
"I would suggest, from the sheep point of view, it's been very difficult for people to get feed," he said.
