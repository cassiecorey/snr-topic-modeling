Price rise to help potato growers
Tasmanian potato growers have received their first price rise in six years.
Processor McCain will pay growers $10 a tonne more for russet burbank varieties and $6 a tonne extra for other varieties.
Grower representative Phillip Beswick says the rise will help farmers facing a difficult season ahead.
"It's pretty significant, the company has recognised the hardship growers are going to be in this year with the problems with water and acquiring it, and the high costs that we've had in the last 12 months," he said.
