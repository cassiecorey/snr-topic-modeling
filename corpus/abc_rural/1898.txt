US beef exports to Korea delayed
A technical issue is delaying the resumption of US beef exports to Korea.
US packers had hoped for an agreement with South Korea on a "bone chip" definition this month after the Koreans agreed in early September to resume imports of US boneless beef.
US Agriculture Department deputy under-secretary, Chuck Lambert, wrote to the Koreans over a month ago and has not had a response.
"The producer segment in Korea's been very opposed to reopening the market, so there is a lot of political pressure in opposition to reopening the market, but the agreement has been that we would open for boneless beef," he said.
But the Koreans have said they will have zero tolerance for bone chips.
