Scientist pushes for more research into NT coral reefs
There has been a call for more research into coral reefs off the Northern Territory coastline.
Marine scientist Dr Victor Gomelyuk says climate change and cyclones have decimated some reefs in the Gulf of Carpenteria.
He says corals should be used as an early warning of destructive changes.
"The main threat is actually global temperature rising," he said.
"When sea temperature is raised above about 32 degrees it's almost lethal.
"Lots of other marine components of biota will be affected by these elevated temperatures and [there will be] other consequences of this elevated temperature you know.
