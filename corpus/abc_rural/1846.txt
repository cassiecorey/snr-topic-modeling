Parasitic wasps' project secures $4m
A research project into parasitic wasps has been awarded $4 million by the National Science Foundation in the United States.
Professor Andrew Austin from Adelaide University will lead the international research to examine and name the thousands of wasp species.
He says wasps are crucial for ecological balance and may be important biological control agents in the future.
