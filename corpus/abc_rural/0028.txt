Inquiry chief
Meanwhile the head of the oil-for-food inquiry has yet to respond to complaints that the investigation is not being conducted fairly.
Counsel for AWB told the hearing yesterday that witnesses had been ambushed and ridiculed.
The comments were in response to criticism from Commissioner Terence Cole last week that AWB's level of cooperation was a facade.
AWB's lawyer said Commissioner Cole's expectations were unreasonable because of the time available to prepare witness statements and the availability of documents.
In another development, the New South Wales Farmers Association says it is prepared to fight to maintain the single desk for wheat exports.
Despite keeping a low profile since the start of the inquiry, the association has today come out in support of the current monopoly export system.
Grains committee chairman Angus McLaren says growing pressure from opponents of the single desk is concerning but grain growers are prepared for any challenge to their marketing system.
"I think the most important thing we can do and what we've been concentrating on doing is gathering our thoughts and doing research and preparing for the battle that we think probably will occur," he said.
