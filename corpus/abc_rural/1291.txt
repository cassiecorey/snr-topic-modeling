Growers urged to aid canker-hit farms
Australian Citrus Growers wants members to donate money to help colleagues in central Queensland affected by the canker outbreak.
More than half-a-million trees were destroyed following the detection of the disease near Emerald in July 2004.
The Queensland and Federal governments are footing 80 per cent of the bill but industry needs to contribute about $200,000.
President Mark Chown is hoping other regions will help out.
"People can contribute as much as they wish," he said.
"We understand times are very tough for all growers at the moment, however, these people have had their entire orchards removed.
"Looking out the back door there's nothing, so we're very concerned about that and this project was put forward and we've been eager to be involved."
And as the winter citrus season wraps up in the Riverland and Sunraysia, fruit exports to China are looking shaky.
Growers have gained official access to the country but they are worried about a tough quarantine protocol to keep the pest, fuller's rose weevil, out of China.
The Federal Government has rejected calls to underwrite the initial fruit shipment.
But Andrew Green, from SA's Citrus Industry Development Board, has not given up hope.
