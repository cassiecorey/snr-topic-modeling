Canadian canola a slap in the face for Aust farmers: Greenpeace
Greenpeace says a shipment of Canadian canola which arrived in Newcastle yesterday is a slap in the face for Australian farmers.
The environmental group is appealing to the major supermarkets and food processors not to use the genetically modified (GM) canola, imported by grains trader Cargill.
Spokeswoman Louise Sales says consumers do not want to eat GM foods and the big food chains should respect their wishes.
"[We need] to build consumer pressure to make companies like Woolworths and Coles refuse to take the shipment," she said.
"If you look at the figures and the predicted canola crops [it is] 400,000 tonnes and domestic demand is only 100,000 to 115,000 tonnes, so we've got ample supplies to meet domestic demand."
