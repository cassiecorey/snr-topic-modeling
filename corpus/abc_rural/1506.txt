Season's first mangoes sold for $25,000
Hundreds of greengrocers packed the Sydney Produce Markets this morning for the annual charity auction of the season's first box of mangoes.
The 12 mangoes, from Pine Creek Plantation in the Northern Territory, sold for $25,000, with the money to be donated to the Westmead Children's Hospital.
The buyer, Fred Piscuineri, says the hospital will also need to get the kids' cutlery out for a surprise dessert today.
"I think we're going to go to the Westmead Hospital like we did two years ago and give them to those poor kids that are in the hospital," he said.
