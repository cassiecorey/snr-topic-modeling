Loss of GPS signal causes problems for grain growers
Farmers are experiencing major problems with their global positioning systems (GPS) because two US military satellites have been taken out of service.
Many grain growers use GPS technology to help them sow crops in the most efficient way, pinpointing crop rows to within centimetres.
But the loss of signal is now causing major accuracy problems and drop-outs, particularly in the middle of the afternoon.
Phil Harris from GPS-Ag in South Australia does not know when the problem will be fixed.
"It's unfortunate at the time that it is happening and of course there's still a lot of farmers out there seeding ... now there are a lot of farmers have commenced on their spray program," he said.
