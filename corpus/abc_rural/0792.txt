Farmers urged to get involved in carbon trading scheme debate
A report commissioned by the National Farmers Federation says farmers should push to have trees on their properties included in carbon trading schemes.
It says schemes being drawn up by states and territories are likely to have an impact on the cost of power used by farmers but this could be offset by selling carbon credits from farm forestry.
The report's author, Brett Janissen from the Allen Consulting Group, says with a New South Wales scheme already established, farmers need to get involved in the debate now.
"It's not completely clear at this point that the system that states are designing will actually countenance forest sinks," he said.
"It's very likely but my advice to the farmers is to throw their weight behind that to push that over the line.
