Cowra Abattoir in receivership
The abattoir at the centre of a row over the Federal Government's new industrial relations laws has been placed into receivership.
Two hundred workers were locked out of the Cowra Abattoir in New South Wales this morning, and meat supplies to local butcher shops were suspended.
The plant hit the headlines earlier this year when management sacked 29 workers under the IR laws, and offered to rehire them on different conditions.
Charlie Donzo, from the Meat Employees Union, says a new workplace agreement had been developed, and he is surprised and disappointed.
"This is absolutely devastating, not only for myself but for the workers at Cowra," he said.
"Given the problems we have had over the last three or four months, and the efforts that the fellows have put into putting in a new agreement in place to make the plant more efficient and that.
