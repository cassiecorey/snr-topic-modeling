Better disease reporting systems urgently needed: academic
A leading health academic says humans are at a greater risk of contracting diseases like the plague, Ross River fever, SARS and HIV because health authorities are not properly tracking diseases carried by animals.
Professor Peter Curson says humans now often come into contact with wild animals and developments like housing estates on former farmland increase the risk of exposure to disease.
He says better reporting systems are urgently needed.
"One classic example of this is how we collect or survey information about infection in animals and how that is done independently from collecting material about disease in humans," he said.
