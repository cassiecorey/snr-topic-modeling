Sheep take over Hay street
A mob of 1,500 sheep has taken over the main street of Hay, in western New South Wales this morning, re-enacting boom times in the wool industry.
The sheep are needed for the Australian Shearing and Woolhandling Championships at the end of the week and rather than truck them in organisers have decided to re-live a part of the town's history.
ShearOutback director Kim Biggs says the spectacle has not been seen for more than 70 years.
