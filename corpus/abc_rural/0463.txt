Credit scheme changes anger farmers
Impending changes to the energy grants credits scheme have not been welcomed in rural Australia.
Until now, claiming the 18 cents a litre credit has been a simple process of posting off a claim form and getting the money back quickly.
But from July 1, the fuel rebate will be delivered through the GST reporting process.
For farmers and other agricultural businesses who are not filing a monthly Business Activity Statement, it will take much longer to get the money back.
Livestock transporter Jim Savage, from Tamworth in New South Wales, fears delayed payments will create problems with cash flow.
"See you, you gotta be up front to pay your fuel bill, otherwise there'd be no fuel," he said.
