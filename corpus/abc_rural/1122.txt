Two confirmed cases of Q fever in NSW border city
Victoria's Department of Human Services has confirmed two cases of Q fever in the border city of Wodonga.
A third person is suspected of contracting the disease, which causes heavy flu-like symptoms.
People working with livestock are usually most at risk of the disease, although the two confirmed patients do not work with livestock.
Director of population health in Albury, Tony Kolbe, says it is unusual, but not impossible, for people who do not work with animals to become ill.
