WA farmers back single wheat desk
The Western Australian Farmers Federation has called for the single desk wheat marketing system to be kept, even if AWB does not operate it.
Despite claims it is not a policy turnaround, it is the first time the federation has appeared to have reservations about AWB's future management of the single desk.
President Trevor de Landgrafft says the power of veto must stay with the single desk, but who manages it has come under scrutiny.
