Beazley commits to examining replanting scheme
The federal Opposition Leader has committed his party to examining a replanting scheme for farmers in drought affected areas.
Kim Beazley has been in central western New South Wales to look at the impact of the drought.
He says it is obvious people are hurting and assisting farmers to plant crops when conditions improve is one way of helping.
"In the short term I'll need to take back and talk through with my colleagues the things that need to happen with regard to the various drought programs, state and federal," he said.
