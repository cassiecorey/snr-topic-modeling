Dry forces cattle sell-off
One of the biggest cattle stations in the world has been forced to sell 12,000 head as the dry continues.
Anna Creek Station in South Australia's far north has reduced its stock levels from 16,000 head to 4,000 since late last year.
Manager Randall Crozier says most of the cattle have been sold or sent to feedlots.
"We've been destocking pretty well since November last year and we're pretty well in full swing now we're down," he said.
"We're down to approximately less than a quarter of our stocking rate at the moment and if it doesn't rain soon, there'll be even less than that.
