Tasmanian wine grapes in short supply
While the mainland deals with a massive oversupply of wine grapes, Tasmania does not have enough for this year's vintage,
The island state is short around 500 tonnes of grapes, mainly those used to make sparkling wines.
The shortage means growers are receiving a good price for premium fruit and winemaker Andrew Pirie says there are no plans to import more fruit.
"If you examine why Tasmania is now, let's say isolated and good position it's because we've stuck with a strong Tasmanian regional branding," he said.
"For 20 years now we've focused on 100 per cent Tasmanian content and that now sets us apart from the south-east Australian blend which is becoming the wine that's in oversupply, so regionality has been our saviour."
Meanwhile a new national task force will work to find niche global markets for Australian wine.
The 13 member "new directions" group will also try to build stronger ties between producers and retailers, exporters and governments.
It is part of a bid to reduce the wine surplus.
And in another development, one company is introducing tetra paks for wine, the same as those used for long-life milk and fruit juice.
Already used in Canada, a business in Victoria's Sunraysia district will become the first company in the southern hemisphere to install the technology.
Ken Henderson from Best Bottlers says the taste of the wine will not change.
"It's virtually unbreakable, it can go into places where glass is not normally allowed in such as sporting venues, beaches," he said.
