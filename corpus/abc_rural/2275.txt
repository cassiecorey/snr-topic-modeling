Green light given to saleyards development
After years of delays, the Western Australian Government has given the go-ahead to a major development to replace the ageing Midland saleyards on Perth's outskirts.
The livestock industry has been frustrated by the delays and cost blow-outs for the proposed Muchea yards.
Although there is still no clear time frame or cost estimate, industry representative Malcolm Edward says he is pleased to hear it is heading in the right direction.
"In the past I think industry was concerned about replacing Midland, but knowing that the other regional centres needed upgrading or replacing, it had been the wish that we'd get a total approach to the whole thing," he said.
