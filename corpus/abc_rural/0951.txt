Trucking industry looks to recruit foreign drivers
The trucking industry wants to start employing migrant workers, as driver shortages and an ageing workforce continue to cause problems.
Current skilled migrant visas do not allow for truck drivers but the Australian Trucking Association (ATA) is confident it can get the industry reclassified as a skilled occupation.
The ATA's Damien MacFarlane says it is a worldwide problem, and Australia will face competition from other countries hoping to recruit drivers.
"You'll find the United States and the United Kingdom are currently facing the same challenge," he said.
"There's many drivers being poached from Australia and have gone to either the United Kingdom or the United States to drive.
"It's fine to say let's go and get migrant drivers, where are you going to get them from? And that's going to be the challenge."
