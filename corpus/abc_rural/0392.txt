Table grape exports resume to Indonesia
Table grape exporters have resumed trade with Indonesia after being shut out of the market last month.
Indonesia has imposed tough new quarantine protocols to reduce the threat of fruit fly, which the industry has branded unworkable.
Some companies have begun fumigating fruit with methyl bromide at a Melbourne facility to meet the new demands but Brett Pickering from exporter Best Fresh says it is not an ideal result.
"There is an additional cost obviously for the treatment," he said.
"In terms of shipping out of the country we lose a bit of flexibility in being able to utilise the Adelaide port for later leaving vessels.
