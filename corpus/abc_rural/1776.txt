Wine exports to UK drop
Australian wine exports have slipped to their lowest level in 16 years, with sales to the UK down 3 per cent.
The latest data from the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation also shows the average price per litre of $3.77 was the lowest in nearly a decade.
But cheaper bulk shipments to China are outstripping all other markets, increasing fivefold to 16 million litres.
The corporation's Lawrie Stanford says the wine glut and foreign exchange issues are partly to blame and the outlook is not good.
"The Australian wine sector is clearly oversupplied at the moment and whilst volumes are growing on the back of principally bulk sales, prices are clearly falling as a result," he said.
