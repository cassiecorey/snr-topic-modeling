NQ wildlife to benefit from grape glut
Grape growers are having trouble getting rid of their fruit this year, but one solution has been to send it to north Queensland, to feed hungry wildlife.
With habitat destroyed by cyclone Larry, surplus grapes from Lopresti Wines in South Australia are being fed to birds like the Southern Cassowary.
Scott Sullivan from Queensland's Parks and Wildlife Service, says they are happy to get them.
