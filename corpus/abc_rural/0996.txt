US wheat farmers sue AWB
Six American wheat farmers have launched a class action against AWB in the United States, claiming the wheat exporter's dealings in overseas markets damaged their own incomes.
According to media reports, the US wheat farmers are alleging AWB engaged in a global campaign of racketeering, money laundering, fraud and bribery.
While some of the allegations relate to the Iraq market, others relate to deals in Yemen, Pakistan and Indonesia.
The US farmers are arguing for millions of dollars in compensation, claiming AWB's actions resulted in them being excluded from certain wheat markets and damaged their economic interests.
But law Professor Richard Garnett says even if the action is successful, there are doubts about whether AWB in Australia could be financially liable.
"We don't generally recognise judgments from foreign countries which are punitive or designed to punish defendents, we only recognise judgments which are compensatory, where a sum of money is provided in compensation for losses," he said.
AWB, which has not yet been served with the writ, says the actions are ill conceived and the company will vigorously defend any claims.
Meanwhile the first shipment of 350,000 tonnes of grain through the Wheat Australia consortium is expected to set sail for Iraq this week.
But AWB International says if there is a new tender to supply Iraq it would prefer to strike the deal itself.
The Iraqi Grains Board has refused to deal with AWB because of its involvement in the oil-for-food scandal.
But AWB International chairman Ian Donges is hoping for a change of heart.
"We'll wait for that tender of course and we'll be talking to Iraq in terms of whether the ban still applies to AWB firstly," he said.
