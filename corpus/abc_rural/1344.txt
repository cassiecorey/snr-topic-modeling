Court to rule on wallaby cull
Plans to cull wallabies on the two biggest islands in Bass Strait are being challenged in the Federal Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
The Wildlife Protection Association of Australia wants to stop approved federal management plans, which allow farmers to shoot and export wallabies on King and Flinders islands.
President Pat O'Brien alleges the plan allows inhumane killing of joeys, breaches the national rifle code and misjudges the size of the wallaby population.
He hopes the case will reveal critical information.
"In the last appeal we had in New South Wales we found out that both Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland had overshot their quotas by about 15,000 animals," he said.
"But they wouldn't tell us unless we sort of had them in court and had them on oath.
