Vets lobby for mandatory attendance at outback rodeos
Vets in the Northern Territory are calling for their attendance to be mandatory at all outback rodeos.
The call was prompted after a horse stumbled and broke its leg at an event earlier this year where a vet was not present.
However some rodeo organisers, like Rod Haines of Pine Creek, say there are not enough vets and the cost would be prohibitive.
"The stock people up here that work these rodeos, work the stock every day and they know what is ill and what's not ill and I think it's up to their judgement to keep it that way," he said.
"They don't want to put sick animals out there in front of the audience and it doesn't make the sport look good.
"If you are going to have a vet at rodeo's you would need a vet at every sport that involves animals and that includes pigeon races, cane toad races, pony club, gymkhana's, camp drafting."
The Australian Veterinary Association has spent the last two years working on a rodeo policy that requires the attendance of a vet.
The Australian Professional Rodeo Association has a code of conduct that involves vets in rodeo as optional.
The NCCAW has created a national rodeo code of practice to protect the welfare of animals.
