Growers to fight imports of NZ apples
Australian apple growers will appeal against Biosecurity Australia's decision to allow imports from New Zealand.
Under the recommendations, tough quarantine measures will be imposed on imports to stop the disease fire blight entering Australia.
But the peak industry body says its 400 page submission on the plan was largely ignored.
Apples and Pears Australia chairman Daryl Ashton says there should be additional inspections of orchards in New Zealand because the disease risks are too great.
"The level of protection, that's the Government's responsibility and we'll be starting to call on the Minister and in fact all parliamentarians to ensure that Australia's level of protection is what it should be and not what Biosecurity Australia wants it to be," Mr Ashton said.
Under the new rules, apple imports will still be banned in WA and the Tasmanian Government is considering imposing its own ban.
Primary Industry Minister David Llewellyn says imports pose a serious risk to the Tasmanian industry.
He says state quarantine regulations could be tightened in response to the import risk analysis.
Meanwhile the New Zealand Government is considering taking action through the World Trade Organisation if the new import risk analysis for apples becomes law.
New Zealand Agriculture Minister Jim Anderton says the proposed quarantine regime will be too expensive for growers and is based on trade protectionism rather than science.
"If we can't get the facts in the way of others' prejudice, we'll have to look at other actions, and the WTO is the last resort," he said.
