Road cuts 'add to Wadeye violence'
Poor road infrastructure is said to have contributed to ongoing violence within the Northern Territory's largest Indigenous community.
Flooding cuts off the community of Wadeye for six months of every year and with only sea or air access it is hard for police to reach.
At least four homes have been destroyed during violence in recent days.
About 100 residents have fled and are camping in tents beside the Port Keats Road in the lower Daly region.
Fifty people are stranded at the Daly River Crossing.
Mango farmer Gary Higgins says they are being forced to camp at his front gate.
"Yesterday when we came in there was about 30 or 40 people all at our front gate," he said.
"There is a big rock bar there and they actually use that from there to get across into the community opposite.
"They can only get their vehicles to our front gate.
