Bull sale 'solid'
It was a big day in Broome in northern Western Australia yesterday, with Ladies Day at the races and the annual bull sale.
One hundred and thirty-six beasts went under the hammer, with a Kimberley pastoralist paying the top price of $4,500 for a brahman bull.
Tony Cooling from Landmark Broome says the sale was solid, without being outstanding.
"We had a very very good clearance, the average was slightly up on last year so both the vendors were smiling and the purchasers all got the fair share of bulls," he said.
