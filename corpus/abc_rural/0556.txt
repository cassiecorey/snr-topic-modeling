Hay export market strong
Australia's hay exports have reached record levels with stronger demand from Japan, Korea and Taiwan.
Murray Smith, from exporting company Balco Australia, says last year exports were valued at more than $200 million.
He says Australia's high quality product is highly sought after and the market is as strong as he has ever seen it.
"If we look at our exports to seasonally adjusted year end of November 05, I think we're up to 685,000 tonnes being exported out of Australia of cereal hay and straw and that's a record as far as I'm concerned," he said.
