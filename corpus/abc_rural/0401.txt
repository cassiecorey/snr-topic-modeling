Blueprint targets strategies to combat rural suicides
The Federal Government has been presented with a blueprint outlining 23 ways to ease the mental health crisis in regional Australia.
The release of the blueprint marks the launch of the Rural Mental Health Network, a partnership of 19 stakeholders from New South Wales.
The Rural Mental Health Network includes mental health support groups, charity organisations, government departments and farming representatives
The network says male farmer deaths from suicide are double that of any other group in the population and is urging governments to take action saying the drought may end, but ramifications such as depression and financial hardship continue for many years.
