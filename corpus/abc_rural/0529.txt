Bush sees no need for US inquiry into AWB
President George W Bush does not appear to think there will be need for a US inquiry into AWB, despite pressure from domestic farm groups and some senators.
The President has expressed confident in the Australian Government's ability to investigate the kickbacks scandal, during a visit to Washington by Prime Minister John Howard.
Mr Bush praised Howard for his free trade efforts, and dodged questions about the AWB, saying Australia was conducting its own investigation into the UN oil-for-food scandal, and Mr Bush looked forward to seeing the results.
At the US Capitol, Mr Howard told Senate leaders he understood the difficulty surrounding the Australia-US free trade agreement.
"I know that things of that kind always create some difficult domestic judgments and considerations ... and, I'm very grateful that it received such strong support," he said.
