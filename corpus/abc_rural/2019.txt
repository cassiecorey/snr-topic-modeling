Japan pressured to lift age limit on beef imports
The US Government is pressuring Japan to lift its age limit on beef imports.
Japan has agreed to accept beef from animals under the age of 20 months in the wake of the outbreak of mad cow disease in the US in 2003.
But US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says the 20 month limit is too restrictive and not the international standard.
