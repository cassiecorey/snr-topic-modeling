Murray irrigators face water price hike
River Murray irrigators in South Australia are paying up to four times more for water, as the dry conditions continue across the Murray Darling Basin.
Temporary water prices have reached an average of $165 a megalitre this month - that's an increase from $44 a megalitre recorded this time last year.
These prices have not been seen since restrictions were first imposed in South Australia four years ago.
Low commodity prices and dry conditions have also seen irrigators sell their water entitlements earlier than usual.
