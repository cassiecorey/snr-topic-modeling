Hay reserved for drought assistance stolen
Hay to feed livestock on drought-affected farms in Victoria has been stolen.
Melbourne Water is cutting grass in its reserves to help to send to farmers in drought-declared areas and was planning to donate around 700 round bales.
Victorian Farmers Federation drought coordinator Brenda McLachlan says thieves have taken hay worth $10,000 that had been cut and left to dry.
"The hay is allocated to needy farmers and so it is very disappointing for us," she said.
