NSW irrigators consider class action over lost groundwater entitlements
Irrigators in New South Wales are considering legal action despite the Federal Government signing off on a $110 million package to compensate them for a loss of groundwater entitlements.
The package relates to major cuts in bore water allocations in six river valleys, but the irrigators say the financial assistance is far too little, too late.
Dennis Moxey from the Lachlan Groundwater Working Group says he understands their concerns, but doubts a class action would succeed.
"It's making some people fairly irate about the whole process now and I'm not sure we are going to be able to hold the irrigators to a negotiation process. They're going to start taking their own actions," he said.
