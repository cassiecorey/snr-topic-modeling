Weather conditions to test firefighters
Hot and windy weather this afternoon is expected to test firefighters battling a large fire near Tumut, in southern New South Wales.
The fire has burnt 13,000 hectares - mainly pine plantations.
Landholders in the Argalong and Goobruhgandra valleys have been on high alert since yesterday afternoon, when the fire breached containment lines.
A handful of people have been relocated.
Last night firefighters were able to put in new containment lines but with hot north-westerly winds forecast for this afternoon there is concern there might be spot-overs.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg is touring the region and an extra 70 fire brigades have been brought in.
A sky crane helicopter is also adding to the aerial attack.
Forests New South Wales will attempt to salvage timber from the burnt pine plantations near Tumut.
At least 10,000 hectares of pines have been burnt so far.
Spokesman Bob Almond says trees that have been blackened can still be salvaged, but there is a time limit.
