Govt's hands tied in water trading dispute
The Federal Government says it is powerless to intervene in a cross-border dispute which is holding up water reform.
Three states have been fined millions of dollars for failing to meet agreed targets on interstate water trading.
Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia will have $10 million, $13 million and $3 million in competition payments withheld respectively, opening up a new row between them and the Federal Government.
South Australia and Victoria claim they are being punished for New South Wales failing to agree on their trading model but the Iemma Government says it has met all of its water trading requirements.
National Water Commission chairman Ken Matthews will not buy into which states are responsible for the hold-up.
"I'm not taking sides among the states, all three states have been working hard," he said.
But Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the Federal Government has no constitutional powers to end the state stand-off.
"That is the constitutional reality," he said.
Victoria and South Australia have agreed on an exchange rate system of open-border trading but New South Wales is calling for a different model which takes into account its lower security water entitlements.
Minister for the River Murray in South Australia Karlene Maywald says she is bitterly disappointed because an agreement on water trading reform has been reached with Victoria.
"We believe that's grossly unfair and we think that South Australia is being docked $3 million when we have done everything we can to ensure that our borders are open," she said.
