Govt promises major farm policy changes
The Federal Government has promised major changes to future farm policy in Australia.
It has accepted 52 recommendations made by the Corish Report earlier this year, including world trade, biosecurity, food standards, drought preparation and land and water management.
Three recommendations were rejected, including tax concessions for rural areas, importing unskilled migrant workers and centralising power over transport infrastructure.
Despite those knock backs, head of the review Peter Corish says it is a landmark win.
