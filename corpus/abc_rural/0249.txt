Pasture shortage limits cattle feedlot expansion
A shortage of pasture in some provinces of Indonesia is limiting the expansion of small community cattle feedlots.
Rather than feed grain, villagers rely on leucaena, legumes, kapok and even banana stems and leaves.
It can take up to 12 months to fatten cattle in this way for the lucrative Jakarta market.
Researcher Maximilian Kapa says one feedlot can support up to 15 remote families in West Timor.
"It is a very good market, especially the Jakarta market," he said.
"Actually the farmers here cannot fulfil the market demand because there is a trend that the population of Bali cattle declines here every year due to uncontrolled breeding and minimised management like that.
