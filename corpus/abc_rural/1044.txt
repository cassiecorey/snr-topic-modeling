NZ butter suspended from Europe
The world dairy market looks set to further weaken after the suspension of New Zealand butter from Europe.
The European Court of Justice made the ruling after a German company challenged New Zealand's import licence.
New Zealand's exports to Europe make up about 15 per cent of the total world butter trade.
Rabobank dairy analyst Tim Hunt says Australian farmers will feel the effects.
"Fonterra and the New Zealand Government are working hard to reverse the decision but if the issue is not resolved and trade resumed within four to six months we're going to have a lot of butter looking for a new home on the global market," he said.
