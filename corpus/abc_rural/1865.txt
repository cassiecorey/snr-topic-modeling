Cherry research, development levy increases
Australia's cherry growers have voted to increase their research and development levy by three cents.
They will now contribute four cents per kilogram, with the industry expecting to raise about $280,000 a year.
The secretary of the Cherry Growers Association, Trevor Ranford, says the rise is long overdue.
