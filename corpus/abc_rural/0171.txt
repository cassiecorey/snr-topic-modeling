'Self-promotion' needed in agriculture industry
Agriculture's future leaders say the industry has to do more to promote itself.
More than 30 young people have taken part in a Young Rural Leaders' Course in Canberra and believe the farm sector is marred by the image of drought-stricken farmers.
They also believe urban consumers do not understand what role farmers plan in producing their food.
Victorian winemaker and lamb producer BeN Clifton says agriculture needs to get proactive.
"Self-promotion is the best way to do it," he said.
"We've got a good product and I know in my region, especially in north-east Victoria, we are absolutely spoilt almost every season even with the wine in the area.
"There's not a single wine style in Australia that can be made that can't be made in north-east Victoria but we have to tell people that.
