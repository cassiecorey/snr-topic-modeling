Aerial contractors look to cut costs
The drought is expected to cut rice production in southern New South Wales by 80 per cent to 200,000 tonnes.
The crop is normally being sown by plane at this time of the year but aerial contractors are reporting a big downturn in business.
Phil Sefton from Field Air at Deniliquin has not employed casual staff this season and is looking at other ways to cut costs.
"There's not many businesses out there that could say if they lost 95 per cent of their work they'd be in a very financial position," he said.
