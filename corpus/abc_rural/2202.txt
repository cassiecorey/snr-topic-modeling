Task force to examine AWB charges
A day after Commissioner Terence Cole has handed down his final report into the activities of AWB in Iraq, 12 people are consulting lawyers about their future.
A special task force will investigate whether they should face criminal prosecution.
Former chairman Trevor Flugge is among a group of people who Commissioner Cole has found should be further investigated for possible breaches of the Crimes and Corporations Act.
He is joined by former managing director Murray Rogers and former chief financial officer Paul Ingleby.
Also named are whistleblowers Mark Emons and Dominic Hogan, executives Peter Geary, Michael Long, Nigel Officer and Michael Watson, and former in-house lawyer Jim Cooper.
Charles Stott has been singled out for his involvement in the smelly Tigris affair, involving BHP and a 20,000 tonne wheat shipment.
Commissioner Cole has also recommended the Wheat Export Authority be given more powers and more money to regulate AWB but he has left AWB's veto right and the future of the single desk to be sorted by the Federal Government.
Former AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg says he is relieved that the Cole inquiry has cleared him of any wrongdoing.
But he says it is a matter of great regret that kickbacks were paid to Iraq and he hopes it does not lead to the dismantling of the single desk for exporting Australian wheat.
"Personally, I think that would be a great shame because I do believe it does provide a great benefit to Australia against heavily subsidised competition, particularly from the US and Europe," he said.
"I think it's very important that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water."
