Locusts swarm across WA wheatbelt
Locust plagues are emerging as a big concern for winter crops in Western Australia this season.
Locusts have made their way from the wet pastoral regions into agricultural areas, with farmers now reporting locusts swarms across the wheatbelt.
Senior entomologist with the Department of Agriculture Kevin Walden says the green feed in the agricultural regions could help locusts survive for weeks.
"We're likely to see these locusts surviving into May but by the time the females are completing their cycle, then numbers will drop off very quickly," he said.
"But, as I said, if the break of the season's early, then there may be a bit of an overlap between crops emerging and locusts still flying around.
