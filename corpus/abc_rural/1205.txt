Taiwan market remains closed to cherry growers
Cherry growers locked out of their $7 million market to Taiwan will not be allowed back in this year.
Most mainland regions were banned from exporting fruit in January because growers could not prove their cherries were free of the Queensland fruit fly.
David Minnis from the Cherry Industry Advisory Committee says trials to treat fruit for fruit fly will not finish until January next year.
"It seems a long time away I know, but we've got to wait till the next season to do the full verification trial, then the evidence is written up in a format that we will then submit to the Taiwanese officials," he said.
