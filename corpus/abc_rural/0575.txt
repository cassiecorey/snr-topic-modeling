FMG considers rail access appeal
A bid by the Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) to use a BHP Billiton railway in Western Australia's Pilbara has failed.
While the line is owned by the mining giant, FMG has argued it should be allowed access to take advantage of the resources boom, instead of having to build another railway.
After years of debate, Treasurer Peter Costello was expected to make an announcement on the proposal yesterday but the deadline passed without comment.
FMG's Julian Tapp says the company is looking at how it might appeal the decision, which is a blow for all small iron ore companies in the region.
"We've been doing this not just for ourselves, but for general public interest," he said.
