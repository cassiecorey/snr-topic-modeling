Remote education changes 'exciting'
Major changes have been announced in the Northern Territory to improve the education of students in remote areas.
Existing schools will be merged into a new distance learning service, with new teaching positions and improved technology.
And under a two year trial, the Katherine School of the Air will also offer classes to up to year nine.
Deidre White of Narwietooma Station, north west of Alice Springs, is hoping the trial will be rolled out across the Territory.
"Parents were really worried about losing our year sevens because our schools go from preschool to year sevens, because it's really to send the kids away to boarding school in year six, or at the end of year six, is really they are just little kids basically (aged 11 or 12 years)," she said.
