Growers fear Coles Myer takeover
Fruit and vegetable growers are concerned a foreign takeover of Coles Myer could squeeze them out of the market.
A US-based consortium has launched a bid to buy the retail giant.
Michael Badcock, from AUSVEG, fears a sale would leave producers at the whim of major international corporations.
"The biggest problem we've got in Australia is that we have two major supermarket chains and that's it, who control about 70 per cent of Australia's market," he said.
"If one of these is taken over by a big world player - and they're quite ruthless in the way they cut costs and cut staff and everything else - if one does it the other one would do it.
"That would be a disaster for producers in Australia."
The Federal Government can reject takeovers that are deemed not to be in the national interest.
But Griffith University's Tony Makin says even with lobbying, farmers are unlikely to stop a takeover bid.
