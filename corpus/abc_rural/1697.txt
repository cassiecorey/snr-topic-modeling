Murray water users warned to expect cuts
The Murray Darling Basin Ministerial Council has released dire predictions about future water allocations in the river system.
With the worst inflows into the Murray River since Federation, high-security water users, who usually receive 100 per cent of their water rights, are being warned to expect cuts in coming months.
Jo Haw from the local government-based Murray Darling Association says farmers are selling water rights in desperation.
"The bottom line is they are doing it against every ounce of their fibre," she said.
"I think people who are putting their water rights on the market now, some of them are very unwilling sellers but they have no choice.
