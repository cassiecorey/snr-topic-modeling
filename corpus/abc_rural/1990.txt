Frost hits apple crop
A quarter of the apple crop in central western New South Wales has been lost, as a result of weekend frosts.
The cold snap hit the Orange region, damaging apples, apricots and cherries.
Batlow producers have also lost around 5 per cent of their crop.
Orange district apple grower Adam Roweth says he lost about half his crop, when the temperature plummeted to minus two.
"I thought I had a problem in one of the blocks," he said.
"The fruit wasn't seen to be growing, but it wasn't because it wasn't growing, it was because it was frosted.
"I have never seen frost that way, in that condition and that bad in my time which isn't very old but I can assure you that I don't think my father would have seen it like that either.
