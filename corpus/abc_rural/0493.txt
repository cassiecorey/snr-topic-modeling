Govt accused of using Budget to shore up Nationals' vote
The Federal Government has attacked Labor's plans for a national high-speed broadband network, accusing it of allocating rural telecommunications money to the cities.
But Labor leader Kim Beazley has used his Budget reply speech to criticise the Government for basing roads spending on shoring up National party votes.
Mr Beazley says Labor would provide free Tafe for traditional trades, more childcare places across Australia and put a stop to importing foreign apprentices.
He also criticised the Government for failing to invest in climate change research, do more to tackle water shortages and laid down plans to provide all businesses and households with fast Internet.
"To you and me this means a broadband system 25 times faster than the sorts of speeds available in Australia today," he said.
But the Government says Labor plans to spend $2 billion earmarked for rural telecommunications to fund broadband in the city.
And National Farmers Federation president Peter Corish says money Labor wants for its plans is already being spent.
