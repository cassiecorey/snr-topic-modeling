Lib MP pushes for NZ apple ban
A federal Liberal Party MP is pushing for a permanent ban on apple imports from New Zealand.
Russell Broadbent from the seat of McMillan, east of Melbourne, is drafting a private member's bill to ban imports from any country with the disease fireblight.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has rejected the bill, saying it would also affect a wide range of imports and exports.
But Mr Broadbent says he will push on with the plan.
"Mr McGauran is the Minister but he doesn't actually have many orchards in his seat of Gippsland does he?" Mr Broadbent said.
"So I don't suppose he's exposed as closely to the issue and as passionately to the issue as many of the backbench members are across the nation."
