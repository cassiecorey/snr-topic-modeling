Wool bale sold to fashion house for $63,000
The finest bale of wool ever offered in Australia has been sold for around $63,000.
The bale of 11.7 micron wool was sold by Ian and Kaye Appledore from Victoria's Wimmera region for 70,000 cents a kilogram to Italian fashion house, Lora Piana.
Ian Appledore is happy with the price, but says the bale was not the best they had to offer yesterday.
"11.7 [micron] wasn't our topline bale, our topline bale eventually sold as well once again to Lora Piana," he said.
"We sold that one for 48. The reason the 11.7 was our second line bale was it just didn't have the strength of the first one.
