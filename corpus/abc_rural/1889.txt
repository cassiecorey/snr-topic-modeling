$5m study to determine Gippsland groundwater decline
The Federal Government has provided $5 million for a study to find out once and for all what is causing declining groundwater levels in Victoria's south Gippsland.
A study by the CSIRO two years ago found subsidence of the Latrobe aquifer was caused mostly by offshore oil and gas production.
Now the Department of Sustainability will conduct further research to see if irrigators should be compensated.
Bill Bodman Senior, from the Victorian Farmers Federation, says the aquifer has been dropping at the rate of one-metre a year for the last 40 years costing farmers thousands of dollars.
"The huge extra cost of lifting the water up the extra distance, that's the major cost in bringing water to the surface," Mr Bodman said.
