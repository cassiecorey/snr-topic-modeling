Thousands turn out for bush sports event
While more than 20,000 people are gathering for the annual Darwin Cup today, around 2,000 rolled up for the Hart Ranges bush sports in central Australia over the weekend.
Rodeo, gymkhana, athletics and novelty events like the kangaroo tail toss and lizard racing kept guests entertained, but the big draw card was the amateur horses races.
A young French woman who works in local Aboriginal communities took out the prized events - the Stockman's Bracelet, and the Stockman's Cup.
"I think on the first race, I'm not exactly sure but I was told I had about four lengths before the second horses, and on the second one I was a bit closer to the other horse, I think about two or three lengths as well in front of them," winner Alienor le Gouvello du Timat said.
