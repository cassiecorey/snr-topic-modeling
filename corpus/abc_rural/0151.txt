US reaches agreement with Japan to reopen beef market
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials says they have reached an agreement with Japan on steps to reopen that country's beef market.
Imports of US beef were suspended in January after a shipment of veal was found to include bone material prohibited by the Japanese.
USDA acting under-secretary Chuck Lambert told a Senate panel his team has answered Tokyo's remaining questions about January's foul-up at a New York veal plant and set in motion steps to resume beef trade, starting with a plant safety checklist.
"Once that takes place, we will have people in the plants and do those verification audits, just as fast as we can," he said.
"That probably will take in the neighbourhood of a week to 10 days, to two weeks.
"And then, the next challenge will be to get the auditings from Japan in, to do the verification visits."
And Mr Lambert says Tokyo has agreed to do outreach with Japanese consumers to outline the changes and reassure them of the safety of US beef - a significant turnaround if true.
Meanwhile beef from the United States is being sold at a 20 per cent discount into Australia's fourth biggest market, Taiwan.
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) says beef sales from Australia are not being affected and does not think the Americans are likely to try the same tactic in the much bigger Japanese market.
Tim Kelf from MLA says food quality and safety are likely to be the issues in Japan, not the price.
"The retailers are being very cautious about just jumping back into American product, the Japanese are not going to rush back to American product," he said.
"I wouldn't necessarily have agreed with that 12 months ago but I think that this time the Japanese consumer from my previous experience many years ago are fairly twitchy.
