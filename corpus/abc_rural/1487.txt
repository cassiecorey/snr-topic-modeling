Herb and spice group urges research levy
The Australian Herb and Spice Industry Association wants its members to back plans for a levy to fund research and development.
At present, most research is done by growers and processors, with some funding matched by the Rural Industries and Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC).
Association chairman Robert Hayes says extra funding is needed to look at present management, marketing, and finding export destinations.
"RIRDC will continue to work with us but it has been made plain and clear that they will only do so for so long before the industry has to stand on its own two feet," he said.
"Just how long that is we haven't been given any indication, but we're not going to sit around and wait.
