Parents warned not to use animal treatments on children
The Australian Veterinary Association is warning parents not to use treatments designed for animals on children.
The association's Dr Matthew Miles says he has heard reports from Victoria of animal flea treatments being used to combat head lice in children.
He says the practice is dangerous.
"There's no safety data whatsoever to describe their use in people and we just don't know what are the effective levels or safety levels," he said.
