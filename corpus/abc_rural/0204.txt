New strains of stem rust disease found in SA
South Australia could be facing one of its worst cropping seasons for the fungal disease stem rust.
New strains of the disease have been found in wheat plants from across the Eyre Peninsula and the southern half of the Yorke Peninsula.
Hugh Wallwork of the South Australian Research and Development Institute says wet conditions over summer helped the disease to thrive.
"I think it would be the most that I have come across in the last 20 years," he said.
