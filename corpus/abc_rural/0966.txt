Sea rangers meet in Arnhem Land
One hundred sea rangers from more than 14 different language groups across Arnhem Land are meeting this week, at the Aboriginal community of Maningrida, 550 kilometres from Darwin.
Aboriginal land makes up 85 per cent of the Territory coastline and while the conference is an opportunity to share skills and ideas, the main focus is finding a secure funding to continue their work.
