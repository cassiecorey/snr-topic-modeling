Work visa crackdown won't stop exploitation, says union
The Meat Industry Union says a new crack down on temporary work visas will not stop migrant exploitation.
The Federal Government will set up an investigative strike force to make sure employers are complying with the conditions of the 457 visas, which allow skilled overseas workers into Australia.
Union spokesman Russell Carr says problems are mainly in smaller meat processing workers, which are largely un-unionised.
"What would be better is what would have applied before the industrial law changes to allow unions right of access to those workplaces and unions will check that out for free of charge for the taxpayer," he said.
