Fire deal links science, Indigenous knowledge
A world-first agreement to link modern science and traditional Aboriginal knowledge is set to revolutionise fire management in the Top End of the Northern Territory.
The agreement is between various levels of government, a liquefied gas company and traditional Indigenous groups in the West Arnhem land area.
It has taken 10 years to develop.
Consultant Dr Justin Russell-Smith says the deal will protect areas recognised around the world for their biodiversity.
"For management at the local scale it's critical," he said.
"There's no other real economic opportunities for people to get employed, get back onto country.
