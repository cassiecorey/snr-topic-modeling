Dollar strength threatens asparagus viability
The high Australian dollar is threatening to force even more asparagus growers out of business this harvest.
Asparagus is sold into the key Japanese market in yen, meaning that as the value of the Australian dollar strengthens, growers are getting less and less money for the same amount of produce.
Sean Lembrey from Australia's largest asparagus exporter Momack Produce says an asparagus glut here in Australia is not out of the question.
"At the moment it's profitable right now but we are at the very beginning of our season," he said.
