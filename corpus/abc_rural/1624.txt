New machinery sales down
Farmers are spending less money on new machinery, with sales last financial year down by 9 per cent to $1.6 billion.
The Tractor and Machinery Association is blaming the drought for a $150 million fall in the sales of broadacre farming equipment.
With the Henty Machinery Field Days under way in southern New South Wales, TMA executive director Vin Delahunty expects business to be slow.
"What we've got is a situation where farmers stopped spending late last year and really haven't started spending again and that's because they're concerned about their cash flow," he said.
