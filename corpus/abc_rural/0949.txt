'Iron Boomerang' plans onshore iron ore processing
The resources sector is investigating a $55 billion proposal to process iron ore in Australia from 2011.
The 'Iron Boomerang' would be a privately-funded 3,000 kilometre railway to link iron ore deposits in Western Australia with coal fields in north Queensland's Bowen Basin.
Blast furnaces to be build at either end of the tracks would produce pig iron for the export market.
An international trade delegation is touring the town of Bowen today to investigate the project.
Shane Condon, from Project Iron Boomerang, says supply chain savings alone could be worth $2 billion per year.
"When trains run empty and ships are coming back from China, or in the Pilbarra, or in the coal fields of Queensland, the return trip for these giant empty trains and ships is 45 per cent of the total trip cost and that is highly inefficient and using fuels unnecessarily," he said.
