Govt optimistic contract changes could save wheat deal
The Federal Government says a 350,000 tonne wheat deal between Australia and Iraq could be salvaged.
Yesterday, the Wheat Australia consortium said it had failed to come to terms with Iraq and negotiations for the $90 million deal were over.
But Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran believes Iraq is considering removing a clause in the contract which Wheat Australia had found unacceptable.
"Negotiations are not necessarily over," he said. "Wheat Australia is working very hard in the interests of growers to complete the sale."
"They've taken a strong line in regard to one particular clause, which they believe would disadvantage commercially Australian growers and that's entirely proper and the right thing for them to do, and it may well be that the Iraqi side is now reconsidering they're insistence in the insertion of that particular clause."
But wheat growers in Victoria say they are not surprised the deal has stalled.
While some say the contract tender should be opened to other companies, others believe it shows the single desk is the only successful system.
"The world wheat market is the highest it has been for five years. We've got people out there wanting to pay a good price for our wheat yet we are not able to fix these deals," one wheat grower said.
