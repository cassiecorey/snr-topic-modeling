Dept hopes sediment flow into Lake Argyle will decrease
Authorities hope they have slowed down the amount of soil running into Australia's largest inland sea, Lake Argyle, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
A decade ago, scientists estimated the Ord River Irrigation Scheme's main reservoir would lose 30 per cent of its storage capacity in the next 100 years.
But sediment levels have recently been surveyed again and Duncan Palmer from the Department of Water hopes they show a slow-down of nutrient build up from wet season run-off.
