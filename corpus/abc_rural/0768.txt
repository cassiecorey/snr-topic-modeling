Lack of rain blamed for reduction in grain export licences
The lack of winter rain in Western Australia has forced the state's Grain Licensing Authority (GLA) to reduce the number of special export licences it issues this season.
The GLA is responsible for granting special export licences for WA barley, lupins and canola, and has approved just four out of nine licences in the latest round of applications.
Chairman Wayne Obst says with the seeding window fast diminishing, seasonal conditions are too risky to hand out further licences at this stage.
"We looked at nine applications and five were deferred because of the season, some for canola and some for malt barley, because we feel at this stage it would be not appropriate to look at it, when the situation for canola is less than ordinary," he said.
