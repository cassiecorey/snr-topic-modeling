Former AWB exec steps down from SA company
One of the men potentially facing charges over the oil-for-food scandal has resigned from South Australian company ABB Grain.
Nigel Officer left last Friday before the Cole report was tabled in Federal Parliament.
Mr Officer, a former executive director of AWB, has left ABB following a management restructure.
Industry analyst Malcolm Bartholomeaus says he is not surprised by the move.
"Nigel was one of the former executives who appeared before the Cole Inquiry who did see the light of day at the end and turned to be one of the whistleblowers," Mr Bartholomeaus said.
