Stud breeders seek govt assistance
Stud breeders in the cattle industry say they are worried about the loss of valuable genetics, unless they receive drought assistance.
Many do not qualify for Federal Government support because of high off-farm incomes.
The industry says most of that income is being used to support stud properties during the drought.
Central Victorian murray grey breeder Marilyn Pell says she is going into serious debt but doesn't want to have to sell cows to abattoirs.
"I've paid up to $2,500 just for one cow because she was a well bred cow with her genetics," she said.
"If I was to send her in now to get her head cut off you know I'd be lucky to get $400.
