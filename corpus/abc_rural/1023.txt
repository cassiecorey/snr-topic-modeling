Ad blitz to counteract animal liberation group campaigns
Australia's peak livestock body is planning a national advertisting blitz to try to counter campaigns against the live export trade being run by animal liberation groups.
Meat and Livestock Australia says consumer attitudes to animal welfare are one of the biggest challenges facing the industry.
Meat and Livestock's chairman Don Heatley says the campaign, which is already running in Western Australia, explains how exporters are trying to improve welfare conditions for livestock.
"We intend over a period of time leading up over the next six months to actually roll that out on a national basis across Australia, so that the community understands what we do," he said.
