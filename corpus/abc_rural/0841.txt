Farmers, service station owners not expecting inquiry to lower petrol prices
The National Farmers Federation and fuel station owners are not expecting another Senate inquiry into fuel will lower prices.
Senator Nick Minchin has announced the new inquiry after pressure from the Federal Opposition.
While there is scepticism about what the Government says is the 45th parliamentary probe into petrol pricing, Ron Bowden from the Service Stations Association says it is always a useful exercise.
"There's always value to an inquiry because the market never stays still," Mr Bowden said.
