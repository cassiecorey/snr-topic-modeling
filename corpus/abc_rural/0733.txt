No bail-out package for grape growers
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has refused to bail out the nation's struggling grape growers, saying the Government is not to blame for the current oversupply.
Ahead of a national wine summit held in Melbourne on Friday, industry groups were looking for partial compensation from the Government to help growers mothball or hibernate their vines.
But Mark McKenzie from Winegrape Growers Australia says the proposals were not even put on the table, and it is a disappointing result.
"The Minister made it clear that it's an industry issue the industry needs to sort itself out," he said.
"Outside the framework of what's currently available there wasn't anything special put on the table other than additional funding to scope the nature of the issue to provide more information to growers to allow them to make those commercial decisions for themselves going forward."
In the west, many grape contracts are coming to an end, and John Griffiths from the WA Wine Industry Association says the situation is fragile.
While warm climate growing areas have already been hit hard, with fruit left on the vine, the oversupply problem is expected to hit cooler areas over the next two years.
Mr Griffiths says the real crunch for WA is yet to come.
"Even if the news itself isn't great it's better that it's clear.
"You're either industry and your going to make some profits or your probably ought to get out. "
