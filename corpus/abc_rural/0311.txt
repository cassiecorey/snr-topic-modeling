Wool industry's survival dependent on young shoppers: designer
Enticing young shoppers to wool is critical to the industry's survival, according to the head of leading men's fashion house, Ermenegildo Zegna.
The company will hold its annual awards in Melbourne tonight for wool producers from Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.
Count Paolo Zegna says his challenge is to get his daughters interested in wearing more wool.
"What worries me the most is not what has happened until now, but what could happen in the future if the young generation of consumers don't get the message from wool," he said.
