Biodiesel club to produce cheaper fuel
Farmers in north-west Victoria have formed a biodiesel club to produce cheaper fuel.
The Sunraysia biodiesel club has about 25 members and is experimenting using recycled fish and chip shop oil, and plans to grow crops specifically for biodiesel.
Club member Paul Geering hopes the locally produced fuel will reduce costs for members by about half and says the final product depends on the quality of the original oil.
