Longest-running land claim now over
The longest-running land claim in the nation is being resolved today in the Gulf of Carpenteria, 700 kilometres south-east of Darwin.
Just over 21,000 hectares across the Sir Edward Pellew Islands, is being officially handed back to the Yanyuwa people, after 30 years of debate.
Many of the original claimants are not alive to see their dream come true, but 71-year-old Steve Johnson says the hand back provides an incentive for others to move back onto traditional lands.
"It's good to see that we are getting our island handed back after so long. There has been a number of deaths in the Yanyuwa and [other] clan groups, 130 all up in that time," Mr Johnson said.
"[But] I think it will make them feel a lot better, that they can move around more freely in their own country.
"The only thing that would be a factor now is the cost of fuel, petrol, diesel stuff like that to get out there.
