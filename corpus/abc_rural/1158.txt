New patrol boat to join illegal fishing fight
A new Navy patrol boat designed to monitor Australia's northern waters for illegal fishing will be commissioned at Port Pirie in South Australia tomorrow.
The Armidale class ship, to be called HMAS Pirie, is the latest in a new fleet of ships dedicated to border security operations.
Lieutenant Commander Kimbal Dunsmore, commanding officer of the new vessel, says the Navy is now much better equipped to intercept and board illegal fishing boats.
"These ships have cutting edge technology. They are a very, very complex machine that offer better endurance, better habitability, longer time on task and a better capability," he said.
