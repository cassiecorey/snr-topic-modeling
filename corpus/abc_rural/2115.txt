US Farm Bill will have strong farm income protections
The new chairman of the US Senate's Agriculture Committee says the next US Farm Bill will have strong farm income protections, despite a global push to cut subsidies.
Tom Harkin argues the White House has siphoned billions (of dollars) from renewable energy, rural development, research and conservation, and he plans to fix that.
But Mr Harkin is also committed to farm supports in next year's US Farm Bill.
"I will continue to view a good, sound system of farm income protection as essential," he said.
And Mr Harkin promises to finally implement long-delayed mandatory country of origin meat labelling, strongly opposed by Australian producers.
"USDA has had plenty of time to figure out how to make it work. So you can bet your bottom dollar it's going to be part of our farm Bill," Mr Harkin said.
