Cattle producers urged to put off slaughter
Cattle producers and dairy farmers facing the prospect of another drought in Victoria are being urged to "park" their cows rather than send them to slaughter.
The livestock saleyards have been packed with cheap cows and steers, as dry weather and low water allocations hit feed supplies.
Doug Chant from United Dairy Farmers of Victoria says agistment schemes have been vital during previous droughts.
"Their only other option is to sell cows to go to slaughter and one of the concerns is that it takes so long to rebuild herds," he said.
