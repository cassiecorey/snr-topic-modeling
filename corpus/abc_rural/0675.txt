Dept, fishermen warn of imported prawn disease
Queensland's Department of Primary Industries has issued a warning against using imported raw prawns as bait, amid growing concerns they could carry disease.
Commercial fishermen want raw prawn imports stopped, claiming health inspections are too random.
They say up to 60 consignments have recently tested positive for white spot disease, the so-called foot and mouth of prawns.
Dr Ian Anderson, Queensland's principal veterinary pathologist on fish disease, agrees that imports do pose a threat.
"Prawns imported for human consumption can get purchased by recreational fishers and then used in their fishing activities and so that is a potential route of the spread of the virus from the imported product for human consumption through to our wild fishery stock," Dr Anderson said.
