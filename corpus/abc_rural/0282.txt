Mutton making comeback in UK
If you thought mutton was a cut of meat that went out with the war years and the depression, think again.
Sheep producers in the UK have started a Mutton Renaissance Club to improve mutton's image, which could increase Australia's already booming export market.
John Thorley from the UK National Sheep Association says they have had a lot of help from their high profile patron.
"Most people had given up on mutton a long, long time ago and then one or two people, his Royal Highness Prince Charles particularly, decided it was time we moved this thing on a bit," he said.
