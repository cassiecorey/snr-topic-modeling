Fishing industries set for restructure
Fishing industries in four regions across Australia look set for major change as a result of a Federal Government buy-back.
The $220 million scheme closed last week and unofficial reports from industry sources suggest that up to half the fishermen in some areas have accepted the Government's offer.
In New South Wales, the South-East Trawl Fishing Industry Association president, Fritz Drenkharn, says eight out of 14 boats have put in tenders and if they are all accepted it will have a big impact on processing plants.
"Oh well, restructuring on the shore facilities, the haulage contractors will also be sitting on the fence waiting to see what's happening in relation to their business, Mr Drenkharn said.
"In the on-shore facilities there's a real lot riding on the line."
Meanwhile, there should be more prawns for Christmas this year, with news that 660,000 baby tiger prawns have survived a cold spell in the far north of Western Australia.
The Kimberley Prawn Company was concerned their post-larval stock had died a fortnight ago, when water temperatures dropped in the tank.
Owner Ian Crimp says it now proves the region is suitable to harvest throughout the year.
"[It] now means that we have the ability of cropping all year round at Derby, whereas parts of Australia they can only crop prawns during the summertime," Mr Crimp said.
