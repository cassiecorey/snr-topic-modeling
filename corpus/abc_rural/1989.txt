Young Aboriginal actor sought for outback epic
The search is continuing for a young Aboriginal actor to star in a major outback motion picture.
Director Baz Luhrmann's sweeping romance and historical epic will star Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman.
Filming on the yet unnamed film is due to begin early next year across Top End station country and he says time is running out to find the third character.
"Now what brings them together though is this child and there an Aboriginal boy between the ages of eight and 10," Luhrmann said.
"He's a very, very primary character and in fact right at the moment, that's my biggest focus.
"We are looking all over Australia for this young Indigenous actor and we have seen some great boys so far, so we have got great possibilities.
