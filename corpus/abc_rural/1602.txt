Tamed NT water buffalo head to Aceh
The first shipment of trained water buffalo from the Northern Territory is being exported to the Indonesian province of Aceh today.
To see domesticated water buffalo being lead aboard a giant live export ship at the port of Darwin is quite unusual.
But today, buffalo, along with camels, goats and cattle, were being loaded aboard the Deneb Prima, which can carry 20,000 to 30,000 head.
Seven buffalo, six cows and one bull have been specially tamed and trained by Queensland buffalo whisperer Graham Heffernan for remote rural villages in Aceh.
At least 30,000 working buffalo were lost in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, and these seven will pull ploughs, carts and carry heavy loads.
