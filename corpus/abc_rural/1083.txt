Shipping delay to leave US retailers short of fruit
There is a looming shortage of Australian citrus in US supermarkets, after engine problems delayed the third shipment of this year's exports.
The ship was delayed in Port Adelaide by 12 days.
Steve Allen, from exporter Riversun, says it will be the first time market demand cannot be met.
"Unfortunately we will run out of fruit for probably a week or less, which means that some supermarkets may go to South Africa but look there is a shortage of fruit in the United States," he said.
