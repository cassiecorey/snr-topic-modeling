Cattle TB surveillance program nears end
After more than 30 years, the tuberculosis surveillance program for cattle will wrap up at the end of this year.
The nation-wide program has been monitoring the health of cattle in northern Australia since 1970.
The chief veterinary officer in the Northern Territory, Brian Radunz, says it is seven years since tuberculosis was detected there, and he is 99.9 per cent certain it has been wiped out.
"Due to the nature of TB you can always have a infection hidden out there but it's very unlikely given the fact that for the last 10 or so years if we have found infection we have been removing all the animals that have been exposed to that infected animal," he aid.
"So unless there's some undetected infection around we should never detect it.
