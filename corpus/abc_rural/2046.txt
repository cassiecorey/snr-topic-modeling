Glider collecting soil, climate change information
A glider is flying over southern New South Wales this week is collecting information for an international project to understand soil moisture and climate change.
The European Space Agency is launching a satellite next year to measure soil moisture from space and Australian researchers are developing models to interpret the data.
The data collected by the glider will make the models more accurate.
The University of Melbourne's Dr Jeff Walker says the aim is to provide farmers and government with better information.
