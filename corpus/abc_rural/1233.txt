Comalco port gets $78m upgrade
The mining boom has seen record demand for aluminium, leading to record production of bauxite at Comalco's Weipa mine on Cape York.
After producing 16 million tonnes last year, the company is on track to set a new record. To cope with growing demand, the company has spent $78 million upgrading its port.
The main part of the upgrade is the installation of a second ship loader, which weighs 650 tonnes.
Weipa manager Rob Atkinson says it can fill giant ore ships in no time at all.
"The ship loader is basically a device which allows the bauxite from the stockpiles to be directly loaded into a ship and then it allows the bauxite to be fed into the ship at a rate of about 6,500 tonnes an hour," he said.
