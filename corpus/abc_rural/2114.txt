Mining company signs carbon trading deal with graziers
A major mining company has signed a carbon trading agreement with Queensland graziers, paying them to keep their trees for the environment.
In a landmark deal, Rio Tinto will pay three landholders in the Charleville area well over a million dollars to offset the release of greenhouse gases.
Broker Mark Jackson from the Carbon Pool company says it does not mean the land is off limits.
"They continue their current management of the land, which is to say leave the current vegetation intact, continue with sustainable grazing activities so that the land is not locked up and doesn't become infested with weeds and feral animals, and they're relinquishing their right to clear," Mr Jackson said.
