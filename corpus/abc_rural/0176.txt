Farmers warned about loss of single desk for wheat exports
Farmers have been warned that grain prices could drop dramatically if AWB loses control of the single desk for wheat exports.
AWB International director Clinton Starr told a meeting of graingrowers at Murtoa in Victoria last night, that the company has secured a $13 per tonne premium each year through the single desk.
He says farmers should be very concerned about any plans to change the single desk after the Cole inquiry and AWB's experience in managing the system is as valuable to growers, as the single desk itself.
"I don't say that that is the only structure that can deliver that," he said.
"But what I would say is that if you change it you have to be very careful when you change or you effect change because in fact a lot of it is wrapped up in the intellectual and brain power of the people you employ to deliver the excess returns to you."
Meanwhile India is looking to import a further 1.5 million tonnes of wheat this year.
