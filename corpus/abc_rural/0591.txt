New gold mine set for official opening
Australia's newest gold mine on the edge of the remote Tanami Desert in Western Australia is being opened today by Governor-General Major General Michael Jeffery.
The Coyote gold mine has taken more than a decade to become operational, at a time when gold prices are enjoying record highs.
The gold mine is situated in the remote desert country between Halls Creek and Alice Springs.
Owned by junior resources company, Tanami Gold, the Coyote mine has taken 12 years from the discovery of its first gold deposits to actual mining.
The project was put on hold last year when management decided the price hike in steel and labour would make it unfeasible, though some number crunching and a revised mine plan turned it into a workable option given the record high gold prices.
The company signed an agreement with traditional owners last year, guaranteeing jobs and business opportunities for the Tjurabalan people.
