Big harvest, good prices cheer cane growers
New South Wales sugarcane growers have begun one of the biggest harvests the state has ever seen.
After a tough few years, growers and millers are reporting high yields, high sugar content and strong world prices.
Rick Beattie, from the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-op, says the state's three mills expect to crush 2.6 million tonnes of cane.
"Early indications from the Broadwater season are good yields and really good sugar, which is fantastic," he said.
