VFF demands end to Goulburn-Murray water trading
The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) wants the State Government to stop water being permanently traded between the Goulburn and Murray River systems.
Currently irrigators on the Goulburn system only have access to a quarter of their annual water allocation, while Victorian irrigators on the Murray can use 95 per cent.
When a water allocation is traded from the Goulburn to the Murray, it is automatically increased from 23 to 95 per cent.
VFF water resources committee spokesman Richard Anderson says as a result, Murray irrigators are now worried their allocations are at risk.
"Once it's transferred down on to the Murray system, the person buying that megalitre of water actually gets to use 95 per cent, being the current allocation on the Murray system," he said.
