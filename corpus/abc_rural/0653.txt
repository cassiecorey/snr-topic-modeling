Wool broker plays down buyer protest
Tasmanian wool broker, Roberts Limited, is playing down a protest by buyers at an auction in Melbourne this week.
Sources claim a large number of buyers did not bid on the Roberts catalogue because they believe the company's new wool pool, to supply fibre direct to customers, will cost them their commission.
Of 2,500 bales offered by Roberts, 38 per cent were passed in.
Murray Best from Roberts has confirmed the protest but says it only involved four buyers.
He says the company only wants to sell 10 per cent of Tasmanian wool through the pool system but admits that figure could increase.
