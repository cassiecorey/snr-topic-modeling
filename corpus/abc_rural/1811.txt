Cereal farmers head north
A small group of cereal farmers from northern New South Wales has had enough of drought conditions and has bought some of the wettest agricultural land in the country.
They have purchased cane farms in north Queensland's Tully area, where annual rainfall regularly exceeds 4,000 millimetres.
Until now, Hugh Ball has grown things like wheat, barley, chick peas and dry land cotton, but he says he and a few mates decided to branch out.
"Really there were three fellas sitting round a table and we're all farmers," he said.
"We're all [from] family driven farms and we were just looking for an opportunity.
"We couldn't do it ourselves so we thought if we team up and use individual expertise this was a logical place to start looking, good rain.
