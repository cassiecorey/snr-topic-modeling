Govt working to clear 457 visa hold-ups
The Federal Government says it is trying to fix problems with the temporary skilled migration program, which have halted visa applications since April.
Under the 457 program, skilled workers are being imported to fill labour shortages, particularly in the meat industry.
But visa applications have been held up, after claims some sectors of the industry have breached the terms of the agreement.
Immigration Minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, says a new labour agreement is being put together, which will clearly define worker skills.
"What I think has been happening is people have been bringing in people described as slaughtermen and butchers and they have been doing boning and slicing work which is inconsistent with the visa as it's constructed now," she said.
