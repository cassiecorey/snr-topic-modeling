Govt lawyers seek access to secret AWB documents
Lawyers for the Federal Government are fighting for access to a handful of secret AWB documents which it claims involve possible fraud.
In submissions today, counsel for the Commonwealth, Ian Harrison SC, told Justice Neil Young in the Federal Court, the selected material must be released to the Cole inquiry, even if it is privileged because it indicates evidence of possible fraud.
Mr Harrison said AWB inflated its wheat price to pay Tigris $8 million, with part of this money being used to pay $2 million in compensation to Iraq for iron filings contamination in wheat shipments.
Mr Harrison said this was a clear breach of UN sanctions and fraudulent.
