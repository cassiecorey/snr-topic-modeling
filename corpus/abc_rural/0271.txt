Bureaucracy to blame for closure, scallop fisher says
Tasmanian scallop fishers say they are fed up with a bureaucracy that has locked them out of the Bass Strait scallop fishery for the past six years.
Now the Federal Government says the fishery will remain closed for another three years.
Scallop fisherman Peter Stegmann says scientific advice showed a limited season was viable and blames overlapping Commonwealth and state fishing jurisdictions for the problem.
He says part of the $220 million earmarked for industry restructure should be spent sorting out the mess.
