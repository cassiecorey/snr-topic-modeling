Water sales should be treated as capital gain, say Nationals
Farmers and irrigators could be taxed at a lower rate for any water they sell under the National Water Initiative after lobbying from the National party.
Former Nationals leader John Anderson met with the Prime Minister yesterday, arguing water sold to the scheme should be treated as a capital gain rather than income, attracting a lower tax rate.
Mr Anderson says taxing the water at premium rates is unfair.
"This is about farmers feeling that the Government is going to keep good faith with them," he said.
