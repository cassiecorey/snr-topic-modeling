WA harvest off to early start
Harvest has kicked off in Western Australia much earlier than normal because of a dry finish to the season.
The first canola delivery to the state's main grain handler, Cooperative Bulk Handling, was made on the weekend in Esperance.
Farmer Gavin Egan says harvest would have been a few weeks later if there had been more spring rain.
"It's been pretty dry here the last three months, pretty well, we were lucky to get a bit of rain at the start of September which pulled us out of it a little bit, but definitely drying off rapidly," he said.
