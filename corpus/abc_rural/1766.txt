Hobby farmers buy up along cattle route
Confidence in the cattle sector is attracting droves of hobby farmers to purchase stock along Queensland's central coast.
People are snapping up small parcels of former sugarcane farms and are choosing cattle, due to their relatively low maintenance requirements.
Smaller saleyards in central Queensland are on track to smash annual yarding records and Elders Livestock Agent, Matthew Lockwood, from Mackay, says he cannot see the trend slowing down.
"As the country gets broken up around the agricultural areas people do find that put a fence up and cattle are pretty easy to handy and run," Mr Lockwood said.
