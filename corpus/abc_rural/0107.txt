Regional workers first to feel impact of IR changes: unions
Unions say regional Australia will be the first to feel the effects of the Federal Government's new industrial relations laws.
The changes come into force today, meaning employers have more power when negotiating contracts with workers.
Dr Chris Briggs from the Workplace Research Centre at Sydney University believes regional workers will see major changes.
"These types of laws were trialled in Victoria in the mid-90s under the Kennett government and what it found is that ... things didn't change all that much in the middle of the capital cities but where they changed were in regional areas where you had three times as many low paid jobs, particularly in jobs like retail, construction and hospitality, so it is likely that regional areas will feel the effects of this," he said.
But farmers and other regional businesses say the changes will lead to more jobs in regional Australia and greater flexibility for workers and employers.
Only farms that are incorporated or in Victoria will be able to negotiate under the new laws but the National Farmers Federation (NFF) says it will be encouraging farmers to incorporate so they can access the changes.
The NFF's Denita Wawn says over time the new laws will lead to better relations between employers and employees.
