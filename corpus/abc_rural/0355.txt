Humans urged to adopt animal eating patterns
A study into the eating patterns of animals could help cut obesity rates in Western countries.
Left to choose their own food, research has shown animals will first seek out protein and never become obese.
In a natural state, the same is true for humans.
But Professor Steve Simpson from the University of Sydney says modern diets with high fat and salt contents trick people into overeating.
"But if you simply change the ratio and you can do that in one or two ways - incorporating high quality protein items in the diet and by that I mean lean meat or fish or high quality vegetable proteins," he said.
