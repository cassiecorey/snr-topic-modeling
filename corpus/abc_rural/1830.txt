Govt extends drought support package
The Prime Minister says the Federal Government is extending its drought support package because it is not prepared to let the number of farmers in Australia drop below a critical level.
John Howard says Australia owes its character and history to its farmers and so the Federal Government is not prepared to let the drought dramatically reduce the number of farms.
He has announced that in 18 already drought declared areas now irrigators, dairy farmers and dryland farmers will be able to claim exceptional circumstances payments.
Mr Howard has also extended income support and interest rate subsidy relief until March 2008 to take account of the length of the drought.
