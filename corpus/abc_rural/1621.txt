AWB chief pushes for end to oil-for-food inquiry
With talk of another extension, the head of AWB says the oil-for-food inquiry needs to be concluded as soon as possible, to give certainty to growers already experiencing one of the worst seasons on record.
Company chairman Brendan Stewart says wheat farmers have a tough harvest ahead and believes the current crop estimate could fall further.
He says most growers have had enough of the inquiry and, like the AWB board, would like to see it ended as soon as possible.
"It hasn't been a pleasant experience for any of us and it obviously builds on the level of uncertainty in the industry," he said.
"We want to move as quickly as possible to give the growers the certainty and assurances they're seeking in relation to the 06-07 pool and going forward.
