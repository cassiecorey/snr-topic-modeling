Natural resource management a high priority for farmers: survey
A new survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows farmers on average spend 121 days of work, or $28,000 in financial terms, maintaining their properties each year.
The survey of 20,000 farmers between 2004-2005, found Australia's primary producers spent $3.3 billion annually on natural resource management.
While the grain and beef industries were the biggest spenders, the highest spender per farm was the cotton industry at a $250,000 a year.
The director of environment statistics, David Brereton, says the study identified how much time and money farmers spend maintaining their properties and their environment, and in what ways.
"Out of the $3.3 billion nationally, weed stacked up as the major cost with $1.3 billion or one third of that being spent on weeds, land and soil issues were $900 million and pest issues was $720 million," he said.
