US drought hits sheep flock
The drought in the United States has not just hit the grain crop.
The latest US Department of Agriculture figures have shown the nation's sheep flock has fallen by 30,000 to 7.7 million head, denting hopes that numbers were rebuilding.
Meat and Livestock Australia says that is likely to increase US reliance on imports from countries like Australia for a number of years.
