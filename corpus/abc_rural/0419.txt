US producers implement animal ID system
US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says major beef buyers have given the country little choice but to implement a national animal ID system.
The National Animal Identification System could become compulsory if not enough US producers volunteer to join by 2009.
Mr Johanns says in response to industry opponents of animal ID in US, major beef competitors Australia and Canada have already implemented systems to trace and contain disease outbreaks.
And most recently, Mr Johanns cited retail demand in Australia.
"I just noticed that in Australia, a representative of McDonalds, which of course is a major purchaser of beef, made a statement about the need for this animal ID system."
Mr Johanns predicted the US industry will have to change with the times, despite some who oppose new costs and less corporate privacy.
