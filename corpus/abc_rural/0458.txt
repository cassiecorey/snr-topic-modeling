Mine rescue comp highlights important skills
Mine safety is in the spotlight, as rescue workers continue to try to free two trapped miners in Tasmania.
Over the weekend miners in Western Australia have been testing their rescue skills at the Surface Mines Rescue Competition in Kalgoorlie.
Cindy Lewis from the Jundee gold mine, who won the best captain award, says competitors were thinking of the trapped miners and their rescuers in Beaconsfield.
"We were confronted with a situation last year at our minesite," she said.
