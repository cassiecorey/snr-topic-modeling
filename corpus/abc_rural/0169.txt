WA's north-west mops up after Glenda
Western Australia's north-west is mopping up after its fourth cyclone of the year which has spared the region from major damage or flooding.
When category 4 cyclone Glenda crossed the coast late last week it dumped hundreds of millimetres of rain, sparking fears of rising rivers and flooding, however most areas have escaped unscathed.
Carnarvon banana growers are thanking their lucky stars Glenda petered out before it hit the region, sparing the region's banana crops.
Grower Bruce Munro says it was a nervous wait on Thursday evening.
"We did really well. We copped a little bit of wind, there's an odd bunch down but we survived very well," he said.
Meanwhile the region's mining industry is also mopping up.
