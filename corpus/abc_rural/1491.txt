Tandou exits wine industry
Dry conditions and the ongoing wine glut have forced a major agribusiness company to leave the wine industry.
Tandou is selling its 21,000 tonne winery at Monash in South Australia's Riverland, after recording a $6.1 million loss for the past financial year.
Chief executive Guy Kingwall says the company will be focusing more on its cotton business.
"Tandou obviously is facing significant challenges with the unprecedented drought area, and the flows of water in the Darling River system," he said.
