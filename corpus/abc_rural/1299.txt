Farmers question fuel package benefits
The Federal Government has pumped $1.5 billion into a plan to tackle high fuel prices, but there are questions over whether the farm or transport sectors will benefit.
Almost half of the package will cover the cost of converting and installing LPG tanks.
Grants of up to $2,000 for the conversion are available immediately.
But it is not expected to benefit farmers because it only applies to private users, and most farmers use machinery run on diesel, which cannot be converted to LPG.
There are also concerns conversions will be delayed because of a huge demand and limited resources.
A three-year program to help service stations adopt equipment to sell ethanol-blended fuel, has also been announced.
But the biofuels industry would have preferred a mandate for ethanol-blended fuel and more pressure on oil companies to buy ethanol.
The Federal Government will also spend $123 million to encourage people to use wind and solar power over generators in remote communities.
There is $76 million to encourage more oil exploration.
