Drought spurs calls to renew healthy sheep flocks
Sheep producers are being urged to take advantage of the drought, to refresh the gene pool of the national flock.
Researchers at the Sheep Cooperative Research Centre have developed new technology to help graziers keep their best sheep, based on their breeding potential for wool and meat.
Stud Merino Breeders Association president Will Roberts says producers are trying hard to hang on to their best animals.
"In a lot of stud flocks and things they're not always age structured, they're quality structured, and it's a little more difficult and people are less reluctant to sell those animals anyway, so they try to hang onto them," he said.
