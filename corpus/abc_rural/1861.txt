Drought dominates National Field Days
New and innovative ways of coping with the drought are the most popular exhibits at this year's National Field Days, currently under way at Orange in central-western New South Wales.
Amazingly, the long-running drought has not dampened the spirits of those attending the National Field Days at Borenore.
It is the oldest field days in Australia, running for 55 years.
Organisers say exhibitor numbers and attendance levels are very similar to last year, with 30,000 expected through the sun-drenched gates to the parched earth of the Field Days site.
The hot topics being debated in forums there include managing the risk of climate change.
