Sunbeam Foods back in the black
Australia's biggest dried fruit processing company has recorded a big turnaround, posting a $7 million profit before tax.
Sunbeam Foods, in Victoria's north-west, also runs a citrus packing shed and juice business.
The company has reduced its debt by $30 million by selling assets, reducing stock and better managing cash.
Chief executive Richard Findlay says the result is an improvement on last year's $700,000 loss but it is still unsatisfactory.
