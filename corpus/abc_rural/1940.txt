Minister to sport new 'cat in the hat' headgear
Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell is getting an unusual present in the mail from King Island in northern Tasmania.
It is a hat made from a feral cat pelt collected during the island's cat trapping program.
Senator Campbell was on King Island recently and mentioned he would not mind a hat as a reminder of his trip.
Hat maker Robyn Eades says she hopes the size is right for a politician's head.
