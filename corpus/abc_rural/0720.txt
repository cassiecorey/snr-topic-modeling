Summit debates rural health plan
A plan to train rural doctors as specialists is being debated at a health summit in the southern Queensland town of Chinchilla today.
The Rural Doctors Association's president, Dr Ross Maxwell, says there is still a massive shortage of doctors and an insufficient intake of students to meet demand.
He is supporting a plan to train doctors to be specialists in rural areas and have general knowledge of obstetrics, anaesthetics, Indigenous health and surgery.
