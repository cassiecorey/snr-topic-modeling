Grazier fined over NLIS breach
For the first time in Queensland, a grazier has been fined for breaching the state's new cattle identification system.
The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is an electronic system of tags for tracing livestock diseases back to the source.
Ron Glanville, from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, says the grazier was taken to court over eight head of cattle that were discovered at Dalby's saleyards without tags.
He says the man was fined $500 but no conviction was recorded.
