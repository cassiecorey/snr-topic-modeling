China deal saves woollen mill
After facing an uncertain future 18 months ago, a century-old Tasmanian woollen mill is making a comeback.
Launceston's Waverley Woollen Mill had been under administration with debts of more than $1.5 million.
But the new managers have struck a deal to sell premium woollen blankets to China.
Managing director Bruce Grant says the company has had to look beyond domestic markets.
"So we had to investigate opportunities overseas and we have been gradually having small shipments to various overseas countries," he said.
