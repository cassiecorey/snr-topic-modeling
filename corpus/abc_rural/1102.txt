Program aims to get country kids talking about depression
A new program tackling depression in country schools is trying to encourage students and teachers to be more open about mental illness.
The beyondblue program comes as new research shows depression and suicide are the two biggest concerns for country kids.
And while students are most likely to turn to their families and friends for support, it is hoped they will also open up to their teachers.
Queensland school counsellor Gary Quinn says students at his school are becoming more willing to talk about depression.
"Most students, once they start doing something to say 'hey help me', they really do want some help," he said.
