Dam compo discussions too early, says minister
The Queensland Government says it is too early to discuss compensation for farmers affected by a proposed new dam near Gympie, in the state's south-east.
The Government is planning to build a 660,000 megalitre dam on the Mary River, which would involve the resumption of 900 properties.
But Water Minister Henry Palaszczuk says it will be a number of weeks before the Government decides if it will definitely go ahead with the plan.
"Currently it's under investigation but if the numbers stack up, of course that will become the site," he said.
