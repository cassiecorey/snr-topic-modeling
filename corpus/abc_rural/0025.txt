Fuel price, weather blamed for hike in fresh food costs
Fuel prices and fluctuating weather conditions are being blamed for a 12 per cent jump in the cost of fresh food over the past year.
The latest food industry analysis from Rabobank shows consumers are paying more for their milk, meat, fruit and vegetables.
But Rabobank's Dr Ben Russell says the money is going to manufacturers and processors, not growers.
"In the case of passing on higher fuel prices it's to the contrary because farmers have got to pay higher fuel prices as well as see the retail prices of the products they're producing going up," he said.
