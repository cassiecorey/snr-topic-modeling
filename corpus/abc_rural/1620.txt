Govts urged not to give up world trade fight
World farm leaders are urging governments not to give up the fight to free up world trade.
Delegates from the 18 member nations of the Cairns Group are meeting in far north Queensland this week to mark the organisation's 20th anniversary.
They will attempt to find a way to revive the deadlocked Doha world trade talks, with the European Union and the US refusing to offer more concessions to cut tariffs and farm subsidies.
David Crombie from the National Farmers Federation says breaking down market barriers is critical for Australian farmers.
"What we are looking at is a more level base where we can compete more openly," he said.
"We think the EU needs to open up its markets more, we think the Americans need to take away some of their home supports and the developing countries need to have less exclusions."
Federal Trade Minister Mark Vaile has put forward a proposal to try to revive the trade talks this week, but it has been dismissed by the head of America's biggest farm group.
American Farm Bureau president Bob Stallman says despite his high regard for Mr Vaile, he feels Mr Vaile's proposal for a 5 per cent EU tariff cut, side by side with a $US5 billion subsidy cut is unfair.
"The 5 per cent is not much, in and of itself but if you add in the potential effects of sensitive products and the percent of products there, not counting special products for developing countries, that's not going to compensate us for giving up $5 billion."
Mr Stallman said Mr Vaile's plan sounds good, five and five, but that's about the best that could be said for it - it doesn't meet US WTO goals.
Visiting Irish Trade Minister Michael Ahern hopes the world trade talks can be put back on track.
Mr Ahern says improved market access is a key issue because 90 per cent of Ireland's production is exported.
He says there is room to negotiate the reduction of agricultural tariffs and subsidies, but the United States needs to come to the party too.
