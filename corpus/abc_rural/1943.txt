Pig ad campaign misleading, say pork producers group
Animal rights activists have launched a new advertising campaign against pig farming.
The ads, put together by the groups Voiceless and Animals Australia, depict pigs in small pens with minimal room and piglets having their eye teeth clipped.
But Australian Pork Limited says the campaign is misleading.
Spokesman Andrew Spencer says the ads are designed to be emotional and are not an accurate reflection of how pigs are grown commercially in Australia.
"The types of words they're using are not trying to portray the independent view of the way pigs are raised," he said.
