Tas bushfires wipe out $50m plantation timber
Tasmania's bushfires have destroyed plantation timber worth an estimated $50 million.
About 17,000 hectares of bush has been burnt on the north-east coast since the fire began last weekend.
Kim Creak from Forestry Tasmania says it is too early for accurate assessments but early estimates place the losses in the tens of millions.
