Banana prices tipped to stay high
If you were hoping to see a fall in the price of bananas this month, wholesalers are warning us not to hold our breath.
Market analysts have been predicting a gradual return of bananas to the market, as north Queensland farms recover from the impact of cyclone Larry.
That would lead to lower prices.
But Sydney banana wholesaler Harry Theoharous says those high prices will be around for a few months yet.
"We've been getting a reasonable volume of fruit out of the New South Wales growing areas and as they've gone through a very cold winter their supplies now do dwindle away," he said.
"We do see a slight increase of fruit coming out of Queensland but we're still looking at around 20 weeks before we get some reasonable volumes coming in.
