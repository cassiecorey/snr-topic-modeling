Apples may be used to produce ethanol
Apples could be the next agricultural commodity used to produce ethanol.
The horticulture industry in Western Australia's south-west says unsaleable fruit could be juiced and be turned into biofuel, fetching up to $120 a tonne.
And Vic Grisotis from Apple and Pear Australia says other fruits could also be used.
"If it's a sugar based product there's no reason why it can't be," he said.
