Hunter Valley coal miners remain on strike
One hundred Hunter Valley coal miners are into the second day of a week-long strike after a breakdown in talks over wages and conditions.
Workers at the Xstrata-owned United Colliery are the first to undertake a court-approved stoppage under the new federal industrial relations reforms.
They have been attempting to settle on a new enterprise agreement since December.
Xstrata says it has made a good offer and believes the strike is part of a broad political campaign by the unions.
But Grahame Kelly from the CFMEU says the offer does not reflect the performance of the work force.
