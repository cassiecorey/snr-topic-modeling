Drug busting wasps still some time away
Wasps might be known for their bite, but their highly-tuned sense of smell could make them the sniffer dogs of the future.
Trials are under way in the United States to train tiny wasps to detect chemicals.
Dr Andrew Austin from the University of Adelaide says the idea is feasible and wasps are quick learners, but he can not see them replacing dogs any time soon.
"They've been able to demonstrate that you can take these wasps and you can train them to recognise that particular chemical," he said.
"It's a long way from that to actually using this particular wasp in a commercial sense, where you could actually use them as drug busting sort of wasps.
