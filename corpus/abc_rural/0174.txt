New crop varieties double yields in East Timor
New crop varieties being trialled in East Timor have doubled yields.
Maize is the stable crop along the rugged country on the doorstep of Darwin and harvest is now under way.
In the steep uplands of Liquica overlooking the capital of Dili, some maize farmers have recorded yields of up to three tonnes per hectare.
That is twice the average and is the result of five years of research and collaboration under the Seeds of Life project, which includes rice, casava, sweet potatoes and peanuts.
This Australian-funded initiative aims to improve nutrition and wellbeing amongst the subsistance-farming families of this newly-independent nation.
