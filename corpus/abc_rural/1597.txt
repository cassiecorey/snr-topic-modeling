APVMA considers deregistration of Short Chain Ester chemicals
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) will announce later this week whether it plans to deregister Short Chain Ester chemicals.
The chemicals are used by farmers to control summer weeds, but in the past spray drift has caused damage to horticulture crops.
It is believed the authority will ban their use from May 1 until August 31 each year, but Geoff Kendell from the Victorian Farmers Federation says a nationwide ban would be disappointing.
"Their modelling that they used was US based, they didn't look at the Australian environment and climate," he said.
"They certainly haven't taken into consideration methodologies that we used and the advanced new techniques that in many cases are world leading.
