Bid to increase cherry research, development industry fails
Just one vote has defeated a bid by the cherry industry to increase its research and development industry.
Ian Hay from Australian Cherry Growers says the levy rise would have helped to open up export markets in China and Taiwan, by funding a fruit fly program.
He says the industry is now working on an alternative proposal to put to producers.
"It exists now at one cent per kilo, however the conference voted unanimously at executive level to go out in the ballot again, but this time at four cents per kilo," he said.
