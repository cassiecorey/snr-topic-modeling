Extention of ag census to small farms welcomed
The decision to include more of Australia's small farms in this year's agricultural census has been welcomed by authorities in coastal New South Wales.
Australian Bureau of Statistic's surveys are in the mail this week, including 30,000 to hobby farms that generate as little as $5,000 a year.
John Williams, from the New South Wales Primary Industries Department, says it will give the first truly accurate account of coastal farm production.
