Wool prices spike
The wool market has hit a two year high.
The eastern market indicator rose a further 3 per cent last week to close on 782 cents a kilogram.
The biggest price hikes were for wool in the medium 19 to 24 micron range, up between 30 and 59 cents a kilogram in Sydney.
Chairman of Inland New South Wales Wool Brokers Rowan Woods says buyers are becoming worried about future supply.
"This had to come. I think there is a real perception or a realisation from the trade that supply will be tight," he said.
"The number of stock that are being sold. You have only got to look at Wagga - 250,000 sheep roughly in a month down there. A hell of a big dent in the number of sheep that will supply wool to the trade.
