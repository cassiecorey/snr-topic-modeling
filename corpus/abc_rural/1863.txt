Ecuador hopeful banana import ban will be lifted
Ecuador and other banana exporting countries are hopeful the ban on Australia importing bananas from the Philippines will be overturned before the end of the year.
The Australian Banana Growers Council says Biosecurity Australia has changed its position on the issue several times, but it must take account of the dangers of Moko disease in its current import risk analysis.
Ecuador's Ambassador Antonio Rodas Posso says if Filipino imports get approved, it will make the application process easier for other countries.
"We have heard that you right now, the Australians, are making research on another kind of banana from another country," he said.
