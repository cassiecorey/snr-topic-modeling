Copper explorer's shares halved
Investors stripped almost $200 million from the value of Queensland copper explorer Cudeco Limited yesterday after it reclassified the size of its Rocklands deposits near Cloncurry.
The company was held in a trading halt for 12 days while the Australian Stock Exchange queried initial exploration work details released to the market.
Yesterday Cudeco was forced to halve the size of the deposit because original estimates did not follow market standards.
Shares in Cudeco, formerly known as Australian Mining Investments, were also slashed by half, finishing yesterday's trade at $3.56.
Hartley's resource expert Rob Brierley says it is a timely warning for shareholders in speculative exploration stocks.
"Certainly it's a touch of reality for Australian Mining Investments, it obviously got a little bit over excited," Mr Brierley said.
"It's by no means the end of the road, but it's probably a little lesson that sometimes you need to prove these things up in a little more detail."
A number of investors in Cudeco have contacted law firm Slater and Gordon about their losses.
