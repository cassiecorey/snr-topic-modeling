Chinese currency may push wool higher
The wool market is hoping for further gains this week, boosted by a re-evaluation of the Chinese currency.
The value of the yuan has been strengthened against the US dollar and wool market analysts say it is already being felt in Australia.
The eastern market indicator rose 16 cents last week to close at 729 cents a kilogram clean.
Landmark's Phil Speers says with the Chinese buying around 60 per cent of Australia's total clip, there could be further price rises.
"This obviously makes their currency more competitive against the Australian currency which is going to make it easier for them to come in and buy our wools," he said.
