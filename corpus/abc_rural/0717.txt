AWB seeks Federal Court ruling on documents
Wheat exporter AWB has returned to the Federal Court today, asking it to decide which documents before the oil-for-food inquiry are protected by legal professional privilege.
Last month the Federal Court ruled AWB's apology document was not covered and could be made public.
The court also ruled that Commissioner Terence Cole had the power to decide whether other documents before the inquiry, including AWB's own internal investigation of the oil-for-food program, were protected.
