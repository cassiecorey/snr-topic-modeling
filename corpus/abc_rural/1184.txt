Wimmera economy hard hit by drought
The lingering effects of the drought and ongoing tough seasonal conditions in Victoria's grain growing Wimmera region are still hitting the region's economy.
The Wimmera Development Association says businesses are feeling the flow-on effects of losing $568 million in grain-related income into the region in 2004.
Chief executive director Phillip Sabien says the situation has not improved for many rural towns.
