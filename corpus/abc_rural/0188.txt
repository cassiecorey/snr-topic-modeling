Bare bummed sheep producing better wool: expert
Research is showing that merinos which are naturally bare in the rear end produce better fleeces than those from other sheep.
The discovery of the sheep on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula two years ago raised hopes of using breeding to end the need for mulesing and crutching.
Professor Phil Hynd from the University of Adelaide says a study of the sheep has also found that the trait can be bred into commercial flocks.
"Bare sheep don't produce less wool, they actually produce more wool," he said.
