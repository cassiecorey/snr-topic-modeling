Beef producers urged not to vote in MLA elections
The Australian Beef Association (ABA) says beef producers should not bother voting in this year's board elections for peak body Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA).
The renegade lobby group has failed to win previous resolutions to remove directors from the MLA board and has not submitted any this year.
President Linda Hewitt says it is pointless to vote because ABA resolutions can be vetoed by the MLA board.
But MLA managing director David Palmer says that has never occurred.
"All I can say is that we should just look at history. Several resolutions have come up year after year," he said.
"Some from the board, some from the registered levy payers, all have been voted upon and all have been acted upon and no vetoes have been applied from board's or from council of that matter."
