Lamb exporter releases new contract conditions for producers
A major Western Australian lamb exporter admits it has taken a risky step by negotiating new contracts for the heavy lamb market in North America.
In recognition of the hard winter across the southern half of the state, meat marketing co-operative WAMMCO has released new contract conditions for producers, allowing for lambs two kilograms lighter.
Chief executive Des Griffiths says the main challenge is to help producers to continue selling their lambs, despite the lack of winter feed and also hold on to the lucrative export markets.
"In Western Australia particularly, we're at risk of losing it because in the eastern states if they have a reasonable season, the product is available out of there," he said.
