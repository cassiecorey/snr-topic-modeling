Australian cattle trade campaign under way in Indonesia
A big push is under way to step up the live cattle trade between northern Australia and Asia.
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is running a major campaign in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta this month, funded by the cattle transaction levy.
Spokesman Mike Hayward says 30 supermarkets will feature cooking demonstrations, recipe cards and giveaways.
"Overall, sales will increase from around about the 650 mark (650,000 cattle) up to over 750,000-800,000 head," he said.
"Probably in the five year period, back up towards 1 million (cattle exported).
"I think it's tens of years, you know there's 200 odd million people up here, it's a growing economy, people are aspiring to getting out of the wet markets into the modern retailers, into the malls.
