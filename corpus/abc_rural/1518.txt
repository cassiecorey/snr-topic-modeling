Dairy industry pledges $15m to fighting fund
A new national Dairy Innovation Centre has been tasked with finding ways to compete with the growing soy milk market.
Seven milk companies have pledged $15 million to the centre, which will be based on Melbourne's outskirts.
Dairy farmers have also contributed, through the levies they pay to Dairy Australia.
Chairman Andrew Donovan says the research into new milk products will help farmers.
"We'll be looking at protecting their price, their milk price, we live in a very competitive environment both as a dairy industry but also dairy industry competing with other food products such as soy, and so this is really a protection strategy," he said.
