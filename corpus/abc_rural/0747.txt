WA finds nifty solution to cane toad menace
A specially trained sniffer dog has been chosen to hunt down cane toads at the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
Nifty, a two-year old female belgian malinois, will begin training immediately and start work in Kununurra from September.
Gaye Mckay from WA's Department of Conservation and Land Management says Nifty is part of an overall plan to keep cane toads out.
"Anything that can stop cane toads from entering WA is a worthwhile investment," she said.
