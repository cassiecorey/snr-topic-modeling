US blamed for trade talks impasse
US President George W Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair say they will make a final effort to save stalled global trade talks after a weekend meeting at the White House.
The Doha talks are at standstill after major trading powers failed to reach agreement on reforms to international farm trade.
The European Commission's Ambassador to Australia, Bruno Julian, says Europe had offered to cut tariffs on imports from 80 per cent to 50 per cent, and blames the US for the impasse.
He says it is up to the US to cut its $26 billion in domestic subsidies to farmers.
