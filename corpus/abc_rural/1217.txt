Nine arrested after orchard raids
Fruit orchards in Victoria's Goulburn Valley were searched by police yesterday, resulting in the arrest of nine people on allegations of extortion, arson, drug offences and organised crime.
Charges are expected to be laid today.
Nine orchards were raided yesterday at the culmination of a 12-month undercover police investigation.
Inspector Gerry Ryan says the case relates to standover tactics being used by some fruit growers.
