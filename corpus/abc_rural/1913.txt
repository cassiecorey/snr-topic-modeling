Tas couple take out top tree farming award
Tasmanians John and Diana Lord have been declared Australia's top tree farmers.
The Lords, from Longford in the state's north, won the title from among six other state finalists at the Australian Forest Growers international conference in Launceston last night.
The family started tree farming in the 1980s and now manages three forest properties and a 1,200-hectare mixed farm.
John Lord says his philosophy has been to plant trees on abandoned farmland where native bush cannot be re-established.
"Over the past couple of decades we've bought some land that was derelict, mainly on the Western Tiers," he said.
