Murray cod fishing moratorium under consideration
Recreational fishing for murray cod in South Australia is under threat because of poor reproduction levels and the drought.
The State Government is looking at a moratorium, worried that more people will catch more cod because of lower river levels.
But recreational fisher Peter Teakle does not agree with a moratorium and says the cod fishing season should be shortened instead.
"I just think that we should show caution - how we are going to construct this moratorium?" he said.
