April rainfall sets Darwin record
The passage of tropical cyclone Monica in the Northern Territory has resulted in new rainfall levels.
Darwin has had its wettest April since falls records began 65 years ago.
A total of 383 millimetres has fallen so far this month and weather bureau forecaster Patrick Ward says that is close to four times the average.
"Darwin had about 53 mm at the airport, down towards Adelaide River it was a lot heavier. East branch Adelaide River had 224 mm, which is quite a lot," he said.
"This time of year it's sort of the clearing up period of the monsoon season and into the dry. It's unseasonably late to get a cyclone. It's just about the latest cyclone we have had."
