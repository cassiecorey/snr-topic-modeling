Top drops go down well with National Wine Show judges
The 2004 and 2005 vintages have proved popular with the judges at this week's National Wine Show in Canberra.
Only premium wines that have won other awards can enter, with the main awards going to wines from Margaret River, the Hunter Valley and the Yarra Valley.
Chairman of judges James Halliday says top drops are cheap because of the wine glut.
"2004, 2005, 2006 which are the three vintages which have brought the oversupply issue right onto the front page, happened to have been three very good vintages," he said.
"So if you're going to have too much wine it's rather a good thing to have too much good wine, or very good wine, rather than too much bad wine."
Meanwhile drought, frost damage and lower water allocations are drawing down Australia's wine stock glut faster than anticipated.
The wine industry has revised down its estimates for next season from 900-million litres to 460-million litres.
Predictions for another extreme drought season next year are expected to bring yields down by 20 per cent.
Lawrie Stanford from the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation says the excess stocks are certainly dropping and that is good news.
"The latest estimate that the industry has is that stocks above a desirable level would rate at something like 460 million litres," he said.
