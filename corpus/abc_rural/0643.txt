Farmers give Vic Budget thumbs down
The Victorian Farmers Federation says the Victorian Budget has failed to target pressing road, rail and water infrastructure needs in rural areas.
In fact, the farming body says the State Budget is so disappointing that it may campaign against the Bracks Government during the November election.
VFF president Simon Ramsay says while funding for education is welcome, the Budget is one of missed opportunities.
"The roads is the main one," he said.
