US dry spell looks positive for Aust wheat growers
A continuing dry spell in the United States is looking positive for wheat growers here in Australia.
Monthly supply and demand estimates were released by the United States Department of Agriculture overnight and are largely unchanged.
But national pool manager for AWB Limited David Johnson says the dry conditions are expected to have an impact on America's hard red winter wheat crop, which is in direct competition with Australia.
"We've already seen downgrades in their production forecasts in Texas and Oklahoma in the southern states," he said.
