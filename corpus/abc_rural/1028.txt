Stakeholders discuss quarantine concerns
A top-level meeting is today discussing how Australia's quarantine system can be improved.
About 60 government and industry delegates have gathered in Canberra to examine a range of concerns.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF), which is facilitating the meeting, says the relationship between AQIS and Biosecurity Australia could be improved to ensure Australia's competitive advantage in agriculture.
While some stakeholders such as the New South Wales Farmers Association have expressed a need to combine the two quarantine authorities, NFF president David Crombie says that is unnecessary.
"I think the really important thing is to make sure that we have the right people sitting around the table when we're putting probabilities on the likelihood of occurrence and we have the right people sitting around the table - and I include industry in that - of assessing what the likely consequence is," he said.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Federal Government has dropped its defences to ensure an open and frank assessment of the system.
"It will be a free-wheeling discussion and there will be different points of view because not all of the many organisations present share entirely the same approach," he said.
