Federation won't bend seed rules
The Australian Seeds Federation says it is not willing to bend the rules to allow farmers to donate seed to other growers this year.
The South Australian Farmers Federation says plant breeders rights that prevent certain seed varieties being traded or given away should be relaxed during the drought.
But the seed federation's Christopher Melham says any changes would stop seed companies investing in new varieties.
