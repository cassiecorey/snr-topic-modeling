Farmers air mining worries
The search for copper, cobalt, nickel and uranium near the Northern Territory town of Batchelor is worrying some local farmers.
Compass Resources has revived exploration near the town, originally built to service the nation's first uranium mine, Rum Jungle, in the 1950s.
Small rural blocks have been developed since then, including a commercial vegetable and fruit farm.
Compass's community manager Tracker Tilmouth says they have yet to reach agreement over how to share resources, including water.
"Because of where the mine is located we have a very large water supply that we have to de-water, so we will be looking at a whole range of activity that we can complement their water supply or whatever," he said.
