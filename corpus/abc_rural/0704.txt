Hopes Landcare deal will revive movement
The first Landcare sister partnership has been established, as the movement looks at ways to reinvent itself.
The Tasmanian-based Tamar NRM and Victoria's Woady Yaloak Catchment Group will share their knowledge, and members hope the link will give them more independence and clout on the national stage.
Chairman of the Victorian group, Michael Rowe, believes other groups will be watching the experiment.
"I hope so and I hope some of them will follow suit because Landcare seems to be stagnating in some areas a little bit," he said.
