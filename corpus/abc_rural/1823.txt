Exercise tests pandemic influenza response
Brisbane is hosting a national exercise responding to a suspected case of pandemic influenza.
The exercise follows a simulated outbreak of foot and mouth disease a couple of years ago.
Queensland chief veterinary officer Ian Douglas says "Exercise Consumption" is the first of its size and scope anywhere in the world but is not directly linked to bird flu.
"Health authorities have been concerned since about 2003 that the H5N1 type of influenza of birds, because there's so much of it about, that it may be the candidate to mutate or change, that it can go in humans and therefore I guess, in the back of everyone's mind, yes that's probably a scenario," he said.
