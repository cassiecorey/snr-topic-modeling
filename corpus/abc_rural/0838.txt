Salvos to maintain refuge staffing levels
The Australian Services Union says the Salvation Army has agreed to maintain staffing levels at its Newcastle refuge for the time being, while negotiations continue over planned staff cuts.
The Salvos want to restructure Faith Cottage, a crisis accommodation centre for women and children, so permanent staff would be employed on a part-time basis.
A night-shift position will also be cut.
The union's Kylie Rooke says management of the centre has agreed to negotiate its position.
"The Salvation Army have responded to our offer of working cooperatively together by saying they are willing to continue discussions and they will maintain the status quo at the service in regards to it being staffed 24 hours and the hours that the staff work," she said.
