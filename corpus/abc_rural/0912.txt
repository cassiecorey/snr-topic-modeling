Rodeo circuit veterans set for reunion
Some of the nation's golden oldies of the rodeo circuit are heading for a reunion
in western Queensland this weekend.
Veteran bull and bronc riders will meet in Injune, north of Roma, to celebrate the town's return to the professional rodeo circuit for the first time in 33 years.
While they will not be competing, local association president Murray Douglas says they will be enjoying a beer and a catch-up.
"They're coming from all over Australia and they'll be telling a few old stories no doubt about how they used to do it," he said.
