US wheat industry facing export problems
Despite a boost from Australia's drought, the US wheat industry is facing widespread export problems due to quality and disease issues.
India is buying wheat again for the first time in seven years, but mostly from Australia and the Black Sea region, not the US.
"It's because their phytosanitary requirement just can't be met. It just creates an impossible barrier to trade," said US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns,
USDA is working with US Wheat Associaties to reduce these barriers.
But the group's Rebecca Coleman says quality and disease issues are "cropping up" elsewhere.
"We're having trouble in the EU, we're having trouble in Japan, I'm sure we're going to have trouble in Korea. We're having trouble right now in Kenya," she said.
Ms Coleman says sanitary barriers are now threatening to become more of a problem for US wheat in some places than tariffs.
Meanwhile, the Grains Council of Australia says a national survey of grain quality shows it is almost 100 per cent clean.
The National Residue Survey of Australian grain, a joint government and industry project, revealed that 99.9 per cent of grain for export complied with Australian Food Standards.
