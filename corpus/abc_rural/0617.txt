Farmers' confidence at low levels
Nearly one third of farmers are expecting conditions to worsen in the coming year.
With a third successive survey in which confidence has declined, Rabobank head of rural banking, Neil Dobbin, says it is almost at the lowest level since surveys began.
Many farmers in New South Wales and Queensland are anxiously waiting for rain in order to start their winter cropping and livestock producers are also affected by the lack of feed and on-farm water supplies.
Mr Dobbin says the drought is causing great stress.
"We are really concerned for our clients and for the rural industry as a whole, there is nothing worse than being in this period of time when you are sitting on the fence if you like, waiting for rain," he said.
"We are in no man's land and we just pray that we really get some good rains and we need substantial rains.
"We just need that break, get the crops in, there is a lot of hand feeding going on at the moment.
