Rain boosts cotton planting areas
More cotton will be planted in south-east Queensland after some of the best rain all year.
A band of rain and isolated thunderstorms crossed the region over the weekend with 102 millimetres recorded at Warwick, 64 at Kingaroy and 51 at Warra.
While some of the state's most drought-affected areas missed out, Darling Downs cotton grower Ian Speed says he can now double his crop planting.
"We'll be able to plant some dryland cotton now, we'd only had about a hundred hectares of cotton that we'd pre-watered and now we'll put in probably another 200 hectares of cotton," he said.
