Crop forecasts
Winter crop forecasts in the eastern states have had a remarkable turnaround due to recent widespread rain.
Grain handler, Graincorp, says early prospects for this season were dismal, but after late breaks in June and July, it is expecting receivals of around 9 million tonnes.
Managing director Tom Keene says that is on par with the past two seasons.
"Victoria around 3 million tonnes and around 5 million tonnes in New South Wales, Queensland we would expect to get around 1 million tonnes," he said.
