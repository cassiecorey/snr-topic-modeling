Leaping croc shocks scientists
An airborne four-metre crocodile has made scientists' hearts skip a beat during research on the Ord River in the far north of Western Australia.
Scientists had been using an electrical current to temporarily stun fish, so as to study them.
But they accidentally sent a shock wave through a nearby crocodile.
Scott Goodson from the Department of Environment says the jumping croc gave everyone a start.
"He breached the water, he got a metre out of the water, that's a big croc!" he said.
"He got a fairly good tickle up, I would have thought!"
Mr Goodson says the reptile is probably just a bit stunned after the accidental shock treatment.
"He's probably taken off and just kicking back behind another rock, I don't think he will come too close to that boat again," he said.
