Barley single desk marketing system abolished in SA
After 10 years of operation, South Australia's single desk marketing system for barley will be abolished.
Despite a majority of South Australian growers supporting a single desk in a open ballot conducted earlier this year, the decision has been overturned.
Barley marketing will be overseen by an independent authority known as the Essential Services Commission over the next three years.
After that, the market will be completely deregulated.
This has been the result of a four month review, pushed by the State Government which has been denied national competition payments of up to $9 million in the last three years due to lack of competition.
