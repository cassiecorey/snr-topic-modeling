Spiralling whitefly found in Darwin backyard
Efforts have begun to control a new pest species found in the Northern Territory.
Spiralling whitefly was previously restricted to Queensland but has now been discovered in a Darwin backyard.
The pest can reduce production in plants like the mango, papaya and guava but Stuart Smith from the Department of Primary Industries says it can be controlled using a natural parasite.
"This is actually an extremely effective parasite," he said.
"It is classical biocontrol in that the parasite really knocks the pest down by 80 to 90 or 95 per cent but there is just enough to survive to maintain the parasite as well as the pest populations.
"But almost always in very low populations and not enough to be damaging."
