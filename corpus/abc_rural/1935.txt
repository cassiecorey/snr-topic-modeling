GM cotton gets green light in northern Australia
The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator has approved the commercial release of genetically modified (GM) cotton for northern Australia.
It is satisfied that five varieties of GM cotton designed to be herbicide and insect resistant will have minimum impacts on tropical environments.
The decision is unlikely to benefit Western Australia's Kimberley region, since the State Government has a moratorium on all GM crops until 2008.
But Cotton Australia's Philip Russell says there is now nothing stopping farmers in north Queensland growing it commercially when prices pick up.
"In Queensland there's no moratorium and we certainly have some interested people up in the Burdekin area of north Queensland who potentially could grow cotton," he said.
