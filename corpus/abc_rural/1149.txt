Wool companies sign merger MOU
Australia's two peak wool companies will press on with a merger, despite an outstanding $27 million debt.
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) and Australian Wool Services (AWS) have been in long-running talks about a merger, but the stumbling block has been AWS's outstanding debt to a UK-based superannuation fund.
The two companies have now signed a memorandum of understanding to look at the legal and financial implications of integration with work to start immediately.
The Federal Government had been approached to help pay off the debt, but the companies now say they will work together to solve the issue.
