Aboriginal corporation fined for neglecting cattle
An Aboriginal corporation in Western Australia has been fined $10,000 for failing to provide sufficient water for 1,500 head of cattle on a station in the state's interior.
The fine was handed down yesterday after the Windidda Aboriginal Corporation pleaded guilty to the charge brought by the RSPCA.
Tim Darcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is important that livestock producers from across Australia stick to animal welfare standards.
