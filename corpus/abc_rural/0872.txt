Dingo wee proves successful in scaring off kangaroos
Perth-based researchers have stumbled on a successful, although unusual, way to frighten kangaroos - dingo wee.
A team from Curtin University believes kangaroos recognise the smell of their long-time predator, the dingo and steer clear.
They hope to isolate the chemical, to create a product that keeps roos away from crops.
Project manager Dr Michael Parsons says they first trialled the smell at a wildlife sanctuary and watched the kangaroos flee.
"She walked out of the bathroom with a tube of urine in an evaporative canister and as soon as she got about five metres from them, they looked at her and immediately fled ... and this was a whole mob of them," he said.
