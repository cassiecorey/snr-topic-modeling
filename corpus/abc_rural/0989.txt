Apple growers take advantage of Italian World Cup win
Apple orchardists in central western New South Wales are already trying to take advantage of this morning's World Cup win by Italy.
Italian-born, but proud Australian orchardist Guy Gaeta says he is looking for white apples to blend with his fruit.
"We have got red and green apples I suppose but unfortunately we haven't got any white ones," he said.
