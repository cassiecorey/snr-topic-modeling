Wheat shortage prompts price spike
World wheat prices have enjoyed their biggest two-day gain in 18 years on the Chicago Board of Trade, amid global supply concerns as droughts affect Australia, India, Europe and the US.
Prices soared 13 per cent to $US5.24 a bushel, the highest level in 10 years before dropping slightly.
The frantic price spike comes after the Grains Council slashed its forecast for the Australian wheat harvest to 12 million tonnes, though American producers believe the Australian crop will be even smaller than that.
The wheat futures rally has been spurred by the massive areas of cereal and canola crops failing in southern and central New South Wales.
These were the comments from producers today from Dubbo through to the Murray River.
"Things have really gone downhill in the last couple of weeks, our deliveries say to Condobolin is probably lucky to get 10 per cent of the normal 150,000 tonnes," one producer said.
"Some areas there will be a small amount of grain harvested, probably about 90 per cent of the canola has now been cut for hay and a small proportion of the wheat has been cut for hay," said another.
"Very little more than 30 per cent will see a header at this stage, I think people are glossing over just how serious this is, another producer said.
"I know we have got people around here turning there stock in on their crops for the first time in 40 odd years. It's very ordinary.
