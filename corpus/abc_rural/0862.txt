Forecast brings more heartache to farmers
There is another gloomy weather forecast for farmers who had been hoping for rain.
The latest climate forecast shows that the vast majority of Australia is likely to receive less than average rainfall over the next three months, with the driest outlook of all in the grainbelt of Western Australia.
And in another blow to grain growers, temperatures are likely to be above average, particularly in New South Wales and southern Queensland.
Dr Andrew Watkins, from the National Climate Centre, says warm sea temperatures in the Pacific are to blame.
