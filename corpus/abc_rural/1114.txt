Book to focus on mothers and daughters-in-law' relationship
The relationships between mothers and their daughters-in-law on family farms is set to go under the microscope in a new book by a South Australian author.
Abi Spehr, from Beachport in South Australia, says introducing a new person into an established family business can be traumatic regardless of whether the two women get along.
She says there has been little research done on what can be a difficult relationship and it is time there was.
