Communities struggle this season
Meanwhile, it has not been feeling a lot like Christmas in parts of fire-ravaged Victoria, with many communities cancelling festive events due to an increased fire threat this week.
But one country town found the time to host a carols service last night, to give the locals a break from the worries of drought and fire.
Nova Underwood from Heyfield says it has been a stressful week, with the fire coming within 7 kilometres of her property.
"Christmas has been put on the backburner, but we're trying to encourage the spirit this week," she said.
