States look to align illegal fishing laws
Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory are looking at aligning their laws to tackle illegal fishing, as part of a joint effort to tackle the problem.
The Federal Government has also agreed to fund a pilot project, examining the role of Indigenous sea rangers in coastal surveillance.
But Peter Cassells, from International Fisheries, says ultimately there will not be a need for rangers to help because the Government wants to stop illegal fishermen before they reach Australian territorial waters.
"I mean in an ideal world illegal fishers will not get through to the coastal strips," he said.
