Central Australian beef producers benefit from WA rain
Central Australia's beef producers are reaping the benefits of recent heavy rainfalls in Western Australia.
Despite the rising freight costs, WA pastoralists are said to be buying cattle from the centre as they look to cash in on the best season in years.
Alice Springs livestock agent Herby Neville says it is the first time in four years that he has seen central Australian cattle heading west.
"They're experiencing a very, very good season over there and I think it's given the Pilbara and all that Western Australia, the Gascoyne and all that a very good drink," he said.
"And because of their flush of the season over there, they sometimes come over here and get a bit excited and buy a few cows and calves."
But agents in the west believe pastoralists are more likely to look to the Kimberley for cattle, because of the high cost of transport.
WA pastoral livestock manager Eric Broad says despite this year's high rainfall not everyone can afford to restock.
"It's an interesting question, there's a belt of country that's been hammered for about five years without any rain. And they're the ones that are really low down in numbers," he said.
