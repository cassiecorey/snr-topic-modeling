Swan Hill ethanol distillery work to begin
Work will start next month on a $60 million ethanol distillery at Swan Hill, in Victoria's north-west.
Australian Ethanol has raised 12.5 million for the project, which should be on line by the end of the year.
Chief executive Peter Anderton expects the facility to process 300,000 tonnes of barley, corn, wheat and sorghum a year.
