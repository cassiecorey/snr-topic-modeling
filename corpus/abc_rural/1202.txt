Project aims to boost zinc production at Mt Isa mine
Resources company Xstrata has announced a $160 million project to turn its Mount Isa zinc mine into one of the world's largest.
Fred White, general manager for zinc metallurgical processing, says production will rise from 5 million tonnes a year to 8 million by the second half of 2008.
He says the project also means more jobs for the region.
"We're looking at, for the duration of the project, having up to 200 extra people working in the concentrator providing construction engineering and contracting services, so it's a good story for the area," he said.
