Hunt under way for Australia's best young truckie
The trucking industry has launched a national campaign to find Australia's safest and most skilled young driver to try to change public perception about the sector.
The winner will receive a $220,000 prime mover.
The competition has never before been held in Australia but has been a big hit in more than 30 countries.
Stuart St Clair from the Australian Trucking Association says the competition is an attempt to tackle any negative images of truck driving.
"The whole purpose of this is to show to the general public and to the industry itself about the professionalism of the industry and the fact that we're looking to attract young people into this business as drivers and other support people," Mr St Clair said.
