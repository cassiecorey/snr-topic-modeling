Incidence of breast cancer higher in rural women: UK study
A British study has found that rural women are three times more likely to suffer from breast cancer.
But Australian researchers say this contradicts with their findings, which indicate the incidence of breast cancer is highest in cities.
John Harding, head of the health register and cancer monitoring unit at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, says the statistics show that women in remote Indigenous communities have the lowest incidence of breast cancer.
"There is a protective effect for breast cancer for women who have children earlier and then breast feed for long periods of time," he said.
