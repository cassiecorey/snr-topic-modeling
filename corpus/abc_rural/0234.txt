Brazil beef exports no threat to Australian markets: producer
There are claims today that Australia will not have to compete with the world's biggest beef exporting country in our key markets for at least a decade.
Beef producer Chris Ward has been working in Brazil for 20 years and says the country is struggling to increase its 174 million head herd due to a poor currency, lack of infrastructure and low commodity prices.
Mr Ward says the major inhibitor is the presence of foot and mouth disease, which will continue to lock Brazil out of Australia's major markets of Japan, Korea and the US.
"In terms of competing with Australia in the premium market that Australia plays in, I don't see that," he said.
