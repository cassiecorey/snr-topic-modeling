Report highlights desire for change to wheat marketing
A new report on the future of wheat exports from Australia has backed calls for changes to the single desk.
Single Vision Grains Australia, a government-funded body, surveyed 27 industry groups from growers to exporters and grain marketers.
Its conclusions mirror other reports about the future of wheat marketing - most want to keep the single desk, but remove AWB's right to veto exports from other traders and bolster the powers of the Wheat Export Authority.
But the Grains Council, which represents around 30,000 growers, says Single Vision should not have carried out the survey in the first place.
Chairman Murray Jones says the council refused to take part when approached.
"For them to say that they're the peak body for the Australian grains industry is absolutely incorrect," Mr Jones said.
"Their press release comes out saying the Australian grains industry's calling for changes to single desk policy, now who's calling for it, are they calling for it?" he said.
