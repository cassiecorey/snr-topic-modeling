Good rain benefits Kangaroo Is beekeepers
Beekeepers on South Australia's Kangaroo Island are having one of the best honey seasons they have experienced in years.
Local apiarist Peter Davis says the large volume of honey is the result of good rains in autumn and early winter which helped set the flower buds.
He also says the dry mild winter kept the bees healthy and active.
