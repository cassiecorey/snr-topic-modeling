Naracoorte meatworkers angry over wages
Local workers at a South Australian abattoir are angry that their hours have been cut, while Chinese employees on temporary visas are being paid full-time wages.
Two hundred and sixty Australian workers at the Teys Brothers meatworks at Naracoorte have been working a four-day week because of a shortage of stock.
But even though the Chinese workers are working a similar number of hours, their visa conditions require that they receive a full week's pay.
Graham Smith, from the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, says it is absurd.
"The meat industry is seasonal to start with," he said.
"Where the terms of the visa are that you've got to have a severe skills shortage that you've got to fill, it seems absurd that in an industry where we stand people down for large parts of the year because there's no work for them, that you can say there's a corresponding skills shortage."
