Vaile denies EU claims of bias
The Federal Government has been accused of bias by the European Union by favouring the United States in negotiations for world farm trade reform.
EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson has also snubbed Australia's invitation to attend trade talks in Cairns next month, calling on the Government to stop criticising Europe's farm policy.
But Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile has flatly denied any allegations of bias.
"Well we have always been very ambitious as far as market access on agriculture is concerned and I reject the notion that we are biased towards the United States," he said.
"In fact we are the only country of the six in the G6 that put compromise proposals on all fronts, on market access, on cuts to domestic support and on changes as far as non agricultural market access is concerned.
