Push for licence review after trawling company goes under
Darwin's prawn trawling fleet has been cut almost in half with the demise of a major company.
Austfish has been placed in receivership with higher operating costs, cheaper imports and season limits believed to be responsible.
It is expected most of the company's 12 boats will be withdrawn from the fleet along with those of a smaller operator, who has voluntarily entered administration.
David Carter of Newfishing Australia is calling on the Commonwealth Government to urgently buy back licences.
"We expect in the next couple of weeks, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will invite all operators in the northern prawn fishery to tender their right, that will be in the form of a buy back," Mr Carter said.
