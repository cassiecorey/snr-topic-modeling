Commercial beekeepers close up shop
The commercial beekeeping industry in the Northern Territory has decided to call it a day.
After the poorest season in memory involving floods, termites, cane toads and a depressed honey market, Kevin Eastburn from the NT Beekeepers' Association says they simply cannot continue.
He says his greatest concern at this point is what the decision will mean for other industries, which rely on local bees for pollination.
