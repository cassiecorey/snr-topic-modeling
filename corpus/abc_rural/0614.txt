Violence disrupts aid to E Timorese farmers
Australian aid efforts to help farmers in East Timor are being disrupted by violence which has erupted in the capital, Dili.
The Seeds of Life project introduces and tests new varieties of major food crops for subsistence farmers.
Team leader Rob Williams says roadblocks around Dili are making it hard to get out to surrounding districts.
"The work in the district continues on, we need to build planting material up, ready for next wet season," he said.
"Cassava, sweet potato, corn-seed and those plants are still growing on.
"We have staff in the districts who are continuing on with the work. The civil disturbance hasn't affected them, anywhere near as much as it has in Dili. There's drivers delivering sweet potato cuttings, we have staff irrigating maize crops, so that we have enough seed and planting material for next year.
