Apple production 'set to double'
International consultants say Australia's apple industry is on track to double production in just six years.
Apple and Pear Australia has employed experts from New Zealand to oversee the project, called Future Orchards 2012.
New Zealand consultant Steve Spark has just finished touring Australia and says the aim of producing 45 tonnes per hectare is realistic.
"The next two years is just to get growers to realise they need to intensify and I think that has pretty much come to the fore now," he said.
"I would say, yes, they should be able to do it, if they're serious about orcharding.
