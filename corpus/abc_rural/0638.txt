Planned merger not achievable, Vaile says
Federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile says a proposal to merge the Queensland National and Liberal Parties now won't go ahead.
He met with Queensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg yesterday and while he denies he has convinced Mr Springborg to abort the plan, Mr Vaile thinks the merger is not achievable.
He says effort now needs to go into developing the Queensland Coalition.
"Clearly if you look at the public comment and concern that's been raised we are fast reaching a point where that is not going to be achievable," he said.
"So my view we need to ensure that Queensland moves ahead developing and refining the existing Coalition arrangements in Queensland."
Deputy federal leader of the Nationals Warren Truss says there is strong support for a united conservative force in Queensland but the merger model was unfair and unworkable for members of the National party .
