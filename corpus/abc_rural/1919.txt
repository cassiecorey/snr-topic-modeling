Govt grant to help cut dairy processor's water use
The major dairy processor in Victoria, Murray Goulburn, is receiving assistance from the Bracks Government to help it cut back on its water use.
The Murray Goulburn plant in Leongatha in Gippsland is one of the biggest water consumers in the region.
Chairman of Murray Goulburn Ian McAulay says he hopes the $1.6 million government grant will mean there is more water left for local towns and farms.
"This one is quite significant," he said.
