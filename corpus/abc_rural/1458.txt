Govt accused of withholding horticulture reports
The Horticulture Council has accused the Federal Government of withholding two independent reports, which it says highlight major failings in the sector's voluntary code of conduct.
The two-year-old reports into the sector's existing code were only published on the Produce and Industry Ombudman's website today.
The move comes just days after federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran signalled that a new code to improve transparency in the industry, might also be voluntary.
The council's Mark Panitz says the reports back up grower claims that the existing code is not working.
"Look the fundamental issue is that Government's kept these annual reports in the bottom draw so they wouldn't be in the public domain during this debate about the need for a mandatory code," he said.
"Now that person's report, an independent report, has said there's systemic problems within the industry within these annual reports and it's also clear evidence that the voluntary code doesn't work."
