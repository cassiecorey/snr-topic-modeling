Salt interception project to benefit Murray River
A project to stop thousands of tonnes of salt entering the Murray River has just been opened near Kerang in north-west Victoria.
The $13 million salt interception project will pump saline groundwater from Pyramid Creek into evaporation basins.
The salt will then be commercially harvested instead of flowing into the Murray.
Goulburn Murray Water's Carl Mather says the project will benefit both farmers and the environment.
"The scheme will stop approximately 22,000 tonnes of salt reaching the River Murray," he said.
