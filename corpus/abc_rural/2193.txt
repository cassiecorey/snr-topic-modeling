Bill aims to strip AWB of veto powers
Two Liberal senators from Western Australia are planning to introduce a private member's Bill to the Senate today calling for the removal of AWB's veto over wheat exports.
Senators David Johnston and Judith Adams say change is needed whatever the outcome of the Cole inquiry report into AWB, set to be tabled in Federal Parliament this afternoon.
Senator Johnston says even if the Bill fails, the Federal Government should act to remove the wheat export veto immediately.
"With about 70 per cent of wheat growers in Western Australia engaged in harvest, withholding their wheat from the statutory marketing single desk operator, I think it's a crisis and I think it's a crisis that needs to be addressed now," Senator Johnston said.
The National party's resurgence in country Victoria is continuing, with more votes counted in the state election.
Labor has conceded defeat in the Gippsland seat of Morwell with the seat going to Russell Northe from the Nationals, with the help of Liberal preferences.
The Nationals also took the seat of Mildura from independent MP, Russell Savage, in a swing influenced by Labor's proposal for a toxic waste dump in the electorate.
The Nationals have increased their Lower House numbers by two to nine members in a poll where they feared they would be nearly wiped out by preference deals.
