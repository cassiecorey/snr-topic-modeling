NQ school to set up vet training centre
A north Queensland boarding school is tackling a shortage of rural vets head on.
The Columbia Catholic College plans to build a veterinary training centre on its campus in Charters Towers.
College principal Althea Norton hopes investing more than $300,000 in a new centre will encourage more students to take up vet science.
