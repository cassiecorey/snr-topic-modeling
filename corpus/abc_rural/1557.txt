Dorper sheep sale sets record price
Sheep that can produce both wool and meat are becoming increasingly popular, with a South Australian dorper ram fetching the top price of $41,000 at the breed's national sale yesterday.
That is a long way above the top price of $18,000 paid for a merino ram at a major sale just weeks ago.
Buyers and sellers from WA, South Australia and Queensland attended the sale at Dubbo, in central western New South Wales, and Paul Jamieson from Elders says there was an almost 100 per cent clearance rate for the 120 rams offered.
