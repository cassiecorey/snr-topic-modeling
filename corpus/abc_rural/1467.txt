Cattle industry prefers 'duffing' to 'rustling'
A move is on to halt the Americanisation of English in rural areas.
The cattle industry is demanding an end to the use of the American phrase "cattle rustling" when referring to livestock theft, rather than the more Aussie "cattle duffing".
Language expert Professor Roly Sussex, from the University of Queensland, says the term "cattle rustling" is now widespread, but it is neither necessary nor particularly appropriate.
