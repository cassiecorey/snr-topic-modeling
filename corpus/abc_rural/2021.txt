Dairy co-op lifts milk prices
A dairy co-operative on the north coast of New South Wales is lifting milk prices to help farmers pay higher costs for grain to feed their cows.
The Norco Dairy Co-op will pay producers just over four cents a litre extra from January.
Chairman Greg McNamara says there is likely to be a major shortage of milk by autumn if farmers are not given support to maintain their herds.
"We're extremely concerned about the cost impact of grain on farmers and how that's actually seeing (a) farmers actually leaving and (b) the current farming supply left is using less grain and getting less milk," he said.
