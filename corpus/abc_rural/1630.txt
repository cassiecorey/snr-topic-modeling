Cairns Group fears time running out for reform
The 18 member nations of the Cairns Group are concerned the window of opportunity is closing to secure a deal to reform world farm trade.
At the end of its three day summit in far north Queensland, the group has called on members of the World Trade Organisation to resume talks by no later than November.
The Cairns Group represents countries that rely heavily on agricultural exports, from Latin America to Asia, and include Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.
For the last few days, the group has been trying to get the Doha round of trade talks back up and running.
The group's chairman, Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile, says the level of ambition has not changed and no-one, not even the US, European Union (EU) or Japan, has hinted they might abort future discussions.
But the group is saying the major players need to be prepared to give more and expect less.
