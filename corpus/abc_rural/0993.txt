Govt urged to rework fuel tax bill
There are claims today that the Federal Government's complex fuel tax bill could spell the end of the biofuels industry.
The renewable fuel sector says investors are being turned away because the bill has reduced its access to the market since its introduction on July 1.
Bob Gordon from Renewable Fuels Australia says the Federal Government needs to go back to the drawing board to make the legislation fairer.
"Unlike the rest of the world which is surging ahead with biofuels industry growth and all of those countries that have emerging biofuel industries have high tariff regimes to protect them against imports until they're established in the market," he said.
"Australia is going in the opposite direction. Progress is going to freeze in Australia, if not worse."
A Victorian dairy company says with the a growing number of biofuel projects on the drawing board, companies will have to convince the Federal Government to offer tax incentives.
John McLean from the Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Factory says his company wants to use bio-gas from its cheesemaking operation as a dual fuel for its milk tankers.
