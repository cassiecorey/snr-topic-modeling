Education the answer to reducing road fatalities, say truckies
There is debate in the Northern Territory about whether to introduce speed limits along the Stuart Highway.
It is believed authorities may be considering introducing a limit of 110 kilometres an hour to reduce road fatalities.
But the Australian Trucking Association's Peter Goed says the answer is more education about the risk of fatigue.
He says it would actually be more dangerous to limit the speeds of motorists trying to overtake road trains.
