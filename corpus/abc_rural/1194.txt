Remote families seek boost in allowances
Families of remote secondary students in the Northern Territory are calling for a higher interstate boarding and travel allowance.
The Federal Government already provides boarding allowances for all isolated children, worth about $7,000 a year.
But Tina McFarlane, from Stylo Station near Mataranka, says the Territory Government should provide extra funds to send isolated children interstate.
She has even considered leasing the station to move the family closer to secondary schooling in Queensland.
"I have a daughter going into secondary school and she has close family in Toowoomba," Ms McFarlane said.
"There are boarding schools in the NT, but it's nearly quicker to go interstate than to Alice and where there is family.
