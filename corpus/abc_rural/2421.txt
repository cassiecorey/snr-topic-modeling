Govt to buy back more scallop fishing licences
The Federal Government will buy back another 150 fishing licences as part of its program to reduce over-fishing in Australian waters.
The new scheme includes one third of the scallop fishers in the northern prawn fisheries and 14 per cent of Bass Strait scallop fishers.
Their earlier applications for buyouts were not considered good value by the Government.
