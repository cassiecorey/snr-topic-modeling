Bath sponge has potential global demand, scientist says
Marine researchers have discovered properties of the golden bath sponge that will benefit agriculture, pearling and medicine.
Dr Chris Battershill, of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, says more work is needed to successfully farm sponges.
"In the agricultural sector the leads can be taken right through to market and quite quickly," he said.
"Australia is leading the globe in many of the areas of farm husbandry and maintenance, if you like, but also in the bio-medicinal sector, there is now a capability to take things into the clinic.
