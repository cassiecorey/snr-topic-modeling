Drought stalls dairy-based managed investment scheme
The development of the nation's first dairy-based managed investment scheme has stalled due to the drought.
Carilla Dairy at Tintinara in South Australia's south-east has failed to find enough cows because of a lack of feed.
The company needs 2,000 head before it can issue a prospectus, but only has 1,200.
Peter Doman from Dairy Management Australia says despite the delays, he is confident the scheme will be successful.
"We're going to try and keep on track, but obviously this year has presented its problems for us," he said.
"We've just got to work towards what we're going to do over the next 12 months. As you said, it's the first dairy farm that's going to be involved in a scheme, we think it'll be sold next year and we think it'll go very very well.
The drought is hitting the dairy sector in general, with milk production dropping below the past two seasons.
