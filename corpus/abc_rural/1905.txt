Lower canola yield a boosts returns
The huge drop in canola production has sent prices up as high as $555 a tonne at east coast ports, almost double last year's returns.
Canola yield forecasts for 2007 are the lowest for a decade due to the drought, down to just 561,000 tonnes, a third of the size of last year's crop.
Australian Wheat Forecasters analyst Ron Storey says canola will have to be transported from coast to coast to meet crushing requirements.
"Most of the canola crop this year will be in Western Australia, we look like having you know something under half a million tonnes of canola in total and more than half of that is going to be in WA," he said.
