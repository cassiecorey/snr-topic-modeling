Gold price increase may force jewellery manufacturing overseas
If you are in the market for a gold wedding band, you had better be prepared to pay more.
The price of June spot gold hit $US596 an ounce this week, putting enormous pressure on Australian jewellery makers.
John Howie, from the Australian Jewellers Association, says at current gold prices, manufacturers will be forced to up the price of jewellery and get their designs made overseas at a lower cost.
"Many Australian manufacturers have bitten the bullet and decided that really what they have to do is design here and use the quality we have in design and manufacture overseas," he said.
"It's the same as the footwear industry and the clothing industry, we just have to find other ways to do it."
Those high gold prices and advances in exploration technology are driving a new gold boom in Victoria.
Ballarat Goldfields has attracted $50 million in international investment to ramp up its production.
And while the Stawell gold mine was being wound down before it was taken over by Leviathan Resources, exploration manager John Dugdale says it is now expanding.
"The grade we try to keep up to the mill is five and six grams of gold to the tonne," he said.
