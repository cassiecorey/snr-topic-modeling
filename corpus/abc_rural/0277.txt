Fruity fly precautions stall fruit, vege exports to Indonesia
Fruit and vegetable exports to Indonesia remain at a standstill, after the introduction of new import protocols to prevent an outbreak of fruit fly.
Exports of grapes, citrus, apples and pears are worth $35 million, but the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service says it has not issued any export permits on products affected by the new protocols, since they were imposed two weeks ago.
Australian growers say the conditions of spraying and inspection make exports to Indonesia uncommercial and is an effectively a ban on their produce.
A trade official was dispatched to Jakarta last week, and the Federal Government has now asked Indonesia to urgently revert to the previous import protocol.
