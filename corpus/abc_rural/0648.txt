Govt blueprint for the bush revealed
The Beattie Government has unveiled a long-awaited $150 million blueprint for rural and regional Queensland.
The blueprint is a three-way partnership between state and local governments and the lobby group Agforce.
It came out of anger over tree-clearing laws and a feeling of neglect by the regions west of the Great Dividing Range.
It aims to improve the sustainability, liveability and profitability of regional Queensland.
It covers a new agreement allowing for up to 50 year leases and a commitment to reviewing how tree clearing laws are implemented.
It is also going to pay farmers to be stewards of the environment.
