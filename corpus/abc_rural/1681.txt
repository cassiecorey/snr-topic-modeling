AWI happy with current marketing funding
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) says it is happy with the level of funding for marketing, despite some grower fears that it is not enough.
AWI is recommending a 2 per cent levy in the upcoming wool poll which would see $35 million spent on product development and marketing.
AWI chairman Ian McLachlan wants to ensure the marketing program is effective before committing more funds.
"If that does work as well as we hope it will, it's not beyond the realms of contemplation to have another poll before the three years is up," he said.
