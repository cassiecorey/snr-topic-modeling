Sheep flock decreasing faster than expected
The Australian sheep flock is diminishing at a greater rate than orginially expected, according to figures just released by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA).
The 2006 Sheep Industry Projections show the national flock has five million sheep fewer than previously thought, at around 100 million, due to the drought.
But overseas demand for Australian prime lamb is booming, with exports to Japan up 30 per cent, and the Middle East market is up by 21 per cent due to strong oil prices.
Live exports remain steady at around 4.5 million.
MLA's chief market analyst, Peter Weeks, is warning that supply will be tighter, because of the slow task of rebuilding.
"Over the next four years, instead of a 6 per cent a year rise in supply, it's going down to about 2 per cent a year," he said.
