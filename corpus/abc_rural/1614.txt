Livestock transport industry slams proposals to combat driver fatigue
The livestock transport industry is continuing its campaign against a draft proposal to crack down on driver fatigue.
Submissions have now closed on the recommendations by the National Transport Commission, to regulate the amount of hours drivers are allowed to work within specific time frames.
George Johnston, from the Queensland Livestock Transporters Association, says the current proposals are unacceptable.
"We thought it was too strenuous for starters for truck drivers to understand and come to grips with, we thought it was just too complex, we think there is economical repercussions down the track," he said.
