EMS accreditation doesn't attract premium price: study
A study has found consumers will not pay extra for food just because it has environmental credentials.
Increasingly farms are adopting environment management systems (EMS), which can cost up to $10,000 to implement.
The Australian Farm Institute has found products stamped with an EMS accreditation do not attract premiums, because consumers expect farmers to be environmentally responsible.
But spokesman Mick Keogh says the EMS system is useful to win new markets.
