MLA manager quits over hacking scandal
After almost a month-long investigation, a computer hacking scandal engulfing Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) has claimed its first and perhaps only scalp.
Late last month, it was revealed MLA staff members had hacked into an online poll on the National Livestock Identification System.
Today, the head of MLA's National Livestock Identification Unit, Christian Mulders, has resigned.
Even though MLA's media statement does not name him, the ABC has confirmed Mr Mulders has resigned.
It is unclear whether he was directly involved in the poll tampering or has taken the fall for others.
Disciplinary action has been taken against a number of other employees but MLA managing director David Palmer has refused to be interviewed.
Australian Beef Association head Linda Hewitt, who raised the alarm over the hacking scandal, remains deeply sceptical.
