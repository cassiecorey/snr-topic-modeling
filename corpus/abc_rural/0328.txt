High bacteria levels stop oyster production
Oyster production in the Bellinger River on New South Wales mid-north coast has been halted due to unacceptably high levels of E. coli.
The New South Wales Food Authority has stopped harvesting Sydney Rock Oysters indefinitely.
John Lindsay from the Bellinger Oyster Growers Association says growers are shocked and more should have been done earlier by authorities.
"We're all extremely surprised because we always thought the Bellinger River was one of the pristine rivers," he said.
"We always thought it was one of the best rivers on the north coast. Obviously not. We knew there were some problems in there.
"We've been onto council, we've been onto the Food Authority to try and clear up some hot spots.
