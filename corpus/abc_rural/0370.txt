Security tight for World Meat Congress
Animal rights campaigners have attempted to disrupt the World Meat Congress in Brisbane, where 600 delegates are discussing the future of the industry.
Protesters crying "murder" also say the Federal Government is sanctioning animal cruelty.
Security is tight at the World Meat Congress with police surrounding the Convention Centre in Brisbane and security guards everywhere inside the building.
The protest comes as Australia is experiencing unprecedented growth in the cattle and beef industry.
Cattle numbers are expected to grow by nearly 3 million head in the next four years and the value of exports has risen by $870 million since 2003, that's on the back of growth in Japan and Korea.
But keynote speaker at the Congress, Professor David Hughes, says while industry cannot ignore concerns about animal welfare, the total opposition to the farming of livestock represents a minority worldwide.
