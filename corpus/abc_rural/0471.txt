Budget good news for rural Australians
There is a fair bit of good news for rural Australia out of Treasurer Peter Costello's 11th Budget.
There is more than $2 billion in extra funding for roads and rail, money for the Murray River and a big crackdown on illegal fishing.
There are also wide ranging tax cuts, which are supposed to leave more money in our pockets and changes to capital gains tax to make it easier for farmers to pass on their properties.
President of the National Farmers Federation Peter Corish is certainly happy.
"This Budget is probably the most positive budget that Treasurer Costello has delivered for rural Australia," he said.
"NFF had three major priorities leading into this Budget, the first one was sustainability, the second one was infrastructure and the third one was taxation relief for rural Australia.
"And I can say that positively we've had movement on all three areas."
More rural Australians will also be able to access the aged pension.
There will also be incentives for farm and mining businesses to invest in new plant and equipment with changes to depreciation rates.
There will also be around $50 million for extra mental health services in country areas.
