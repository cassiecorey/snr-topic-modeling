Biofuels industry facing grain cost challenge
A new report says the biggest challenge for the fledgling biofuels industry is to keep down the cost of grain for alternative energy production.
The independent report predicts Australia will almost double its production target of 350 million litres of biofuel by 2010.
But report author Graeme Bethune says cost is the biggest problem and eventually grain which is currently exported may be in demand by manufacturers.
