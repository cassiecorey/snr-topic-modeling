I didn't see rorts cables: Howard
Prime Minister John Howard has told the Cole inquiry he does not believe he received or read any cables that warned AWB was involved in sanctions-busting.
Mr Howard was under tight security when he arrived at the commission to explain when he first knew about AWB's improper payments to the Iraqi regime.
Blocked-off streets, bag searches and sniffer dogs greeted those who entered court two on level five of the building ahead of the Prime Minister's long-awaited appearance at the Cole inquiry.
The Prime Minister spent a brisk 42 minutes in the witness box.
When senior counsel assisting, John Agius, asked him to put a date on his knowledge that the Iraqis were rorting the oil-for-food program, Mr Howard said it was probably a year before a speech he gave on Iraq to the National Press Club in March, 2003.
When asked if he knew AWB was involved in that rorting, Mr Howard replied: "No, I didn't. I had always believed the best of that company. It would never have crossed my mind it would have behaved corruptly."
Commissioner Cole refused any cross-examination of the Prime Minister, saying it was outside the terms of reference.
