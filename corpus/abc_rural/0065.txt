Veg growers urge greater marketing mix
Vegetable producers want to join forces with other rural industries to try to increase sales.
Peak grower group Ausveg is looking at cross-commodity marketing, as one of the ideas included in a new industry strategy.
Chief executive, John Roach, says with increasing global pressures on primary producers, the time may be right for more co-operation
"There is real leverage to be had with vegetables in particular co-marketing product with other rural commodities, such as seafood, such as meat, start making whole of meal solutions, particularly on an export focus," he said.
