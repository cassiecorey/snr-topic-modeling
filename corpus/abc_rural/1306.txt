Farmers urged to lobby for weed bio-control programs
Scientists are calling on farmers to lobby for more natural ways to control weeds.
The Co-operative Research Centre for Weed Management says the use of bugs and diseases to control invasive plants over the past 100 years has provided $10 billion worth of environmental and agricultural protection.
Despite criticism that natural control methods are too slow and unreliable, Dr Rachel McFadyen says the new research suggests previous efforts have prevented invasive plants from wrecking the environment.
"What we're saying to farmers is if farmers have got a significant problem year after year then they should be asking their agriculture representatives and their state government members, is there a bio-control program against this weed?" she said.
"And if there is, does it have enough funding to get it going and if there isn't why is there one?
"Because it's one of the best returns on money that they can get."
Meanwhile large tree cropping companies in Western Australia are opening their gates to agist sheep from drought-stricken farms.
Integrated Tree Cropping has 70 plantations in the state's south-west and wants to use sheep to control weeds.
Spokesman Andy Wright says it should help the company too by saving thousands of dollars a year on pesticides.
"We would have to carry out management on those weeds," he said.
"We'd have to spray the weeds within the plantation or we would have to slash round the outside of the plantation.
