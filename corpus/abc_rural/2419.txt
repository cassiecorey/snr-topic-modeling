Thunderstorms bring welcome rain to Eyre Peninsula
There has been a wide range of rainfall totals recorded in South Australia, as a result of large thunderstorms which crossed the state overnight.
While the rain barely settled the dust in some areas, dams were filled on the eastern Eyre Peninsula and through the state's mid-north.
Jan Girdham, who farms between Kimba and Cleve, had one of the highest totals with 52 millimetres.
