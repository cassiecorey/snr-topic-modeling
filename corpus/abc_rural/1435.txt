Isolated growers ship fruit to Europe
Mango growers in Katherine and Kununurra in far north Western Australia are setting up a company to sell fruit directly to European markets.
Trials of sending fruit to Europe via sea freight have until now been heavily financed by government and industry.
The success of those trials has led to the new venture.
Executive officer Jill Parker is confident it will work, despite difficult market conditions in recent years.
"Not a lot of prospects on exports for this area other than getting this sea freight to work," she said.
"It's been difficult for them to be able to justify to spending this sort of money that's needed to to get this off the ground.
