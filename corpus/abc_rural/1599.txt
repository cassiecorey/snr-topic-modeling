Seeney vows to fight Mary River dam construction
The new leader of the Queensland Nationals says he is determined to fight the construction of the controversial Mary River dam in the state's south-east.
Former deputy Jeff Seeney will take over from Lawrence Springborg in the wake of the Coalition's disastrous showing at the recent state election.
He says water policy is a key area of difference between the Coalition and the Government.
"The answer is to build the dams where the Government had planned to build them for many years and where successive governments have acquired the land," he said.
"The sites are there, but the answer is also to focus on water recycling, to recycle some of the water that is still being discharged into Moreton Bay.
"Peter Beattie talks endlessly about his water grid, he hasn't laid one length of pipe yet, to ensure that water is recycled and the answer is also in pursuing the emerging technologies like desalination.
