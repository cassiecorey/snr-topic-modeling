Food prices hit 15-year high
Australia has posted its biggest increase in food prices in 15 years.
Rabobank says the figures, which are being blamed for a big jump in inflation, show an 8.3 per cent rise in food costs.
But head of food and agribusiness research Bill Cordingley says the rise was mainly driven by soaring banana prices, with fruit prices up a stunning 52 per cent for the June quarter.
Prices rose for citrus fruit, apples, melons and strawberries, due to consumer demand for an alternative to bananas.
