Canola price on the way up
The price outlook for canola has improved over the last few weeks, with Canadian carry over stocks and projected plantings being reduced.
As well, Canada has reported improved crush tonnages and canola exports.
Katie Cole, from Cooperative Bulk Handling in Albany in Western Australia, says there is also good news on canola pricing from Europe's bio-fuel industry.
"Europe is also the last major reason why we're seeing some really good news in the canola market and that's the bio-diesel industry," she said.
"Europe's expected to double it's consumption of vegie oils for bio-diesel this year which will mean going up from 3 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes.
