Qld shearer wins Diamond Shears comp
A shearer from southern inland Queensland has won the the Diamond Shears competition, run for the first time in five years at Longreach over the weekend.
Once regarded as the most prestigious shearing event in the southern hemisphere, organisers have battled insurance problems but managed to attract shearers from three states and New Zealand for this year's event.
Winner Laurie Bateman says he hopes it will help entice more young people into the wool industry.
"I think if we can keep these sport shearing competitions going, we may be able to entice a few more rural people out of the towns to come into our industry," he said.
"I can see it being the best show in Australia down the track. Anybody can shear a sheep or come into a shearing shed, wool handle, press, class, if you are fit and keen enough to get out there and earn a bit of money."
