US calls on Aust to help to restart WTO Doha Round talks
US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns and US Trade Ambassador Susan Schwab will be in far north Queensland this week for the 20th anniversary summit of the Cairns Group.
Mr Johanns and Ms Schwab want Australia's help to restart the stalemated WTO Doha Round of trade talks.
Mr Johanns says Australia has the 'high ground' when it comes to free trade.
"They are free traders, they are very, very supportive of market access and so, during the negotiations over the last couple of years, they have been right there with us, doing everything they can to push the idea that tariffs need to come down, that we need better market access, really, on a worldwide basis," he said.
And Mr Johanns says non-subsidisers Australia and New Zealand are pushing to reduce farm subsidies as well.
