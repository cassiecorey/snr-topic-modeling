Storm season prediction lifts oil price
The price of a barrel of crude oil has gone up again overnight, after the United States' weather forecaster predicted an above-average storm season in the Gulf of Mexico.
Twenty per cent of the gulf's oil facilities are still off-line from last season.
ANZ Bank commodity analyst Andrew Harrington says it is the 11th above-average cyclone season in a row, and is raising questions about the effects of climate change.
"Another above-average season doesn't say much when the average is creeping upwards," he said.
"I guess it's kind of ironic when fossil fuel is driving the climate change and then you have climate change hammering fossil fuel supplies."
