Recycled water blamed for lettuce damage
Lettuce growers in Victoria fear their crops are being damaged by recycled effluent water from the Werribee Sewage Farm, near Melbourne.
More than half of Australia's iceberg lettuces are grown at Werribee.
The farmers have been using the recycled water since last year, when the State Government banned the use of underground water due to the drought.
Southern Rural Water spokesman Clinton Rodda says an investigation is under way to find out what has caused stunted growth and discolouration of lettuces.
"Certainly the salinity is higher than ideal and this is an interim scheme until, hopefully, the salt reduction program will move to lower salt in the long-term," he said.
"But I think these farmers in Werribee south are very effective in the way they manage their crops, they're aware of the higher salinity.
Some of them have dealt with higher salinity bores for many, many years in the past, so they learn how to deal with those high salinity levels."
