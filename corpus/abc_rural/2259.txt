Woolworths to pay more for beef in WA
Woolworths says it will lift the prices it pays for beef in Western Australia to help farmers through the drought.
Prices paid to Western Australian suppliers will increase by a minimum of two cents a kilogram.
The supermarket chain has denied the increase is linked to an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission into meat prices.
Tim D'arcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is a welcome step.
"It's a very minimal increase," he said.
