Pulp mill integrated impact statement released
Timber company Gunns has released an integrated impact statement for its proposed pulp mill at Bells Bay in northern Tasmania.
The company says the $1.4 billion project will create 4,000 jobs during construction and add hundreds of millions of dollars to the value of export woodchips.
Environmental groups are worried the mill could result in more logging in native forests, although that has been rejected by project manager Les Baker.
"Not one tree will be cut down or one tree planted as a result of this project," he said.
"It simply transfers 60 per cent of Gunns export chips [that otherwise go to Asia] where its value added to a pulp mill in Tasmania.
"Woodchips are sold for about $90 a tonne where as pulp is sold for approximately $800 a tonne so it's a terrific value adding project."
