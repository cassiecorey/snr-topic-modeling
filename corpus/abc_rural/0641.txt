Survey points to excellent outlook for dairy farmers
There is an excellent outlook for Australia's dairy industry.
Dairy Australia has released its latest report based on the annual dairy farmer survey and interviews with industry members.
The report finds nearly two thirds of dairy farmers are looking to increase the scale of their operations but many smaller operators are selling out or changing to beef or crops.
Increased demand means strong price competition for suppliers between processors.
But one of the report's authors, Steve Spencer, says processors are concerned that tight supply will mean a loss of markets.
