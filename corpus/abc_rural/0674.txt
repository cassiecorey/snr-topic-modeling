Herpes-like virus threatens Vic abalone stocks
Efforts are under way to control a herpes-like virus which is killing abalone off the south-west Victorian coast.
The disease, ganglioneuritis, has been detected at four farms in south-west Victoria and at Flinders near Port Phillip Bay, with millions of dollars worth of stock having to be destroyed.
Fisheries Victoria says the disease has now escaped into the wild off Port Fairy.
Fisheries executive director Peter Appleford says although a similar disease devastated the abalone industry in Taiwan in 2003, he is hopeful control measures will stop a further spread here.
"What we're looking at is to put some controls in place along the coastline to limit the activity there," he said.
