Grain prices
But an analyst predicts grain prices will drop another $20 a tonne on the back of the inquiry into AWB.
Malcolm Bartholomaeus says pool returns have already dropped by $20 a tonne this year from the average price over the past five years.
He says the premiums that AWB was achieving through its wheat export monopoly have been severely eroded.
