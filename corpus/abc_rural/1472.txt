Murray River winter flows at record low
The Murray River has had its lowest winter flows on record due to the dry conditions across the Murray Darling Basin.
In a normal year almost 4,000 gigalitres of water flows down the system, but this year only about 400 gigalitres was recorded.
Trevor Jacobs, from River Murray Water, says New South Wales irrigators will be most affected.
"Very limited water availability to New South Wales in particular," he said.
