Grape vines stripped as drought continues
In far western New South Wales, a table grape grower is stripping healthy vines to keep them alive, with the Menindee Lakes system at just 15 per cent capacity.
Menindee irrigator Paul D'Ettorre says if big rains do not come by March, he faces the prospect of walking away from his family's 60-year-old farm.
While he expects table grape prices to remain steady for the season, Mr D'Ettore says the long-term future is uncertain.
"We will be okay as long as we keep getting the top-up rains, but we keep falling back," he said.
