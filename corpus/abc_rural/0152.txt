Govt clears way for Snowy Hydro sale
There has been heated debate in Federal Parliament, with the Government clearing the way to sell its 13 per cent share of the Snowy Hydro Electricity Scheme.
The Government and Opposition support the sale but the Nationals' Kay Hull and independents oppose it, saying privatisation could harm irrigator water entitlements and environmental flows.
Member for New England Tony Windsor says the Government has rushed through the sale motion without enough public consultation.
"There are so many unknowns in terms of the Murray Darling system that this is not the time to place into private hands an instrumentality that can have an impact on environmental and water entitlement needs of that system," he said.
