Seaweed fertiliser helping farmers battle frost
Farmers are using seaweed fertiliser as a way to protect horticultural crops from frost.
Victoria has had several frosts in the past month, with cherries, grapes, stone fruit and apple crops being damaged.
Scientists believe the liquid fertiliser works by hardening the plants cells, so the frost cannot pull the moisture out of the fruit.
Consultant Dr Colin Young, a former Melbourne University chemistry professor, says there are limitations to the seaweed's effect.
"It takes 12 hours to kick in and then gives you reasonable protection for two weeks then it starts to decrease," he said.
