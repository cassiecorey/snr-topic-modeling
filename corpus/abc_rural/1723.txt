Live cattle exports to Egypt to resume
Australia's peak livestock industry bodies have welcomed an agreement to resume live cattle exports to Egypt.
Shipments were halted after the broadcast of footage of cattle having their tendons slashed to restrain them at an Egyptian abattoir.
The Australian and Egyptian governments have signed an agreement to track all Australian cattle until they are slaughtered at three abattoirs.
At the abattoir where the cattle were filmed, Minister for Agriculture Peter McGauran says an oversee will be appointed to ensure Australian standards are met.
