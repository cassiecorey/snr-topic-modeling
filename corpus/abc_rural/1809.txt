Water trading plans will damage country towns: Joyce
National party Senator Barnaby Joyce says the Federal Government's current water trading plans will damage the social and economic infrastructure of regional towns.
He has made the comments after a meeting with the head of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Wendy Craik.
There are plans to take more water for environmental flows and increase water trading across state boundaries.
Senator Joyce says the very life of country towns is in jeopardy because their economic prosperity will be traded away with the permanent sale of their water.
"What'll happen is the function of small towns based around irrigation on a sustainable basis will lose their water to other mechanisms that probably don't have the same history, the same infrastructure, economic and social infrastructure based round them," he said.
