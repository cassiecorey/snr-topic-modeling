Farmers fear further chemical bans
Farmers are worried the Federal Government will ban access to more chemicals commonly used in agriculture, in response to last week's terrorism arrests in the United Kingdom.
Some say restrictions on the ammonium nitrate fertiliser have made the chemical prohibitively expensive.
The Victorian Farmers Federation says the future of another 84 fertilisers, herbicides and fumigants is being considered by the Government.
Spokesman Geoff Kendall says because farmers already have to obtain training certificates for many of the chemicals, the Government should not over-react.
"We understand it will be the farmers won't have access to these products," he said.
"Basically they'll be banned from using them in the future so we're very very concerned.
