US Farm Bill debate begins
The battle has started early in Washington over the next US Farm Bill, due to be drafted next year.
The White House and Congress do not see eye to eye on farm policy.
While US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns and the White House are calling for sweeping changes in US farm policy, lawmakers are defending the status quo.
Top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee Collin Peterson told a farm bill field hearing in Texas, US agriculture should not be singled out for cuts.
"This budget talk irritates me a little bit because agriculture did not cause these budget problems. And I do not agree that we ought to be the ones that have to pay the price because we've actually saved money," he said.
