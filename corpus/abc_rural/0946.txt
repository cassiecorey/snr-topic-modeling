Tin mill's closure to force can imports
In a further blow for the manufacturing industry, tinned fruit and vegetable processors will have to import cans from next year, after the closure of Australia's only tin mill.
High iron ore prices have lead BlueScope Steel to shut its Port Kembla mill.
That will force canneries to either import tin or look for alternative packaging.
The head of the Food and Grocery Council, Dick Wells, says increased costs are putting manufacturing under a lot of pressure.
"People need to be aware that it's tough all the way and there's no easy life here," he said.
"If we're not innovative in this country in looking for ways to take costs out of the structure and produce products that consumers see additional benefits in, then there won't be a future."
