'Beef only' cattle granted entry to Qld
Queensland has opened its borders to cattle from Victoria and the BJD control zone in New South Wales, as long as it's classed as "beef only".
The state had previously banned cattle due to concerns over the disease bovine Johne's.
Cattle which have not been run with dairy cows for five years, or grazed on land which has run dairy cattle within 12 months, will meet the classification.
Michael McCormack, from the Cattle Council, says it's a successful outcome.
"Especially for southern producers it's a good news story," he said.
