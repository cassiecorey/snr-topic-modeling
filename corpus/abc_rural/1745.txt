Number of rural financial counsellors to be cut
Rural financial counsellors say they will have to cut staff because the Federal Government's latest round of funding does not go far enough.
The Federal Government topped up funding for the scheme by $10 million in the last Budget and the new program kicked off this month.
But Louise McArthur from the National Association of Rural Counselling Services says a number of counsellors will be lost in every state because the money will only fill funding shortfalls.
"It was slashed hugely, but there's been no negotiation regarding that and I think this has been the big issue right across the country," she said.
"That from the regions and the states we've put in what we think was an applicable appropriate number of counsellors, but we haven't been able to fund that level of counsellors and with the climate change and conditions across Australia our demands are going to become greater not lesser."
