King Is residents seek wave power study
Residents of King Island in Bass Strait are calling for a feasibility study into wave power, in the hope that one day the island could be self-sufficient in electricity.
Australian-developed technology is currently being trialled at Port Kembla in New South Wales but King Island resident David Kerr says he would also like to see it tested off King Island's coast, which is known for its blustery weather.
He says the island's position is ideal.
"We have an active wave climate here on the western side of the island in particular, being at 40 degrees south in the path of the roaring forties," he said.
