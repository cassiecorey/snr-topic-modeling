Rural Aust fairly protected from interest rate rise: NAB
Rural Australia is expected to ride out any further interest rate rise better than most.
The National Australia Bank (NAB) says many farmers have locked their loans into fixed rates to guard against a rise.
It is widely tipped the Reserve Bank will announce an increase of a quarter of a per cent tomorrow.
The NAB's general manager of agribusiness, Wayne Carlson, says the farm sector is managing its financial commitments much better.
"Of our agricultural loan book there is something in excess of 70 per cent of that managed on fixed rate or capped rate, or with interest rate risk management tools if you like applied to assist," he said.
