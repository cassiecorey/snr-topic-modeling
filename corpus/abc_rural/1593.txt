Growers, farmers reject code of conduct
Peak vegetable grower group AUSVEG and the National Farmers Federation (NFF) have rejected the Federal Government's proposed voluntary code of conduct for the horticulture sector.
Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane outlined the proposal to provide more transparency to the way growers sell their produce during a day-long meeting in Canberra yesterday.
But questions are now being asked about the number of grower representatives who were from Queensland.
Apart from the NFF, AUSVEG and the Horticulture Council, the four other grower delegates all represented Queensland business interests.
National party Senator Ron Boswell, who has been a staunch supporter of a mandatory code for growers, believes other states were represented.
