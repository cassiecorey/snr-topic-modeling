Quick growing kingfish trial under way in SA
Under a project in South Australia, captive kingfish will be tricked into doubling their growth rate, by having an extra long summer.
Port Lincoln-based company Clean Seas will work with a Danish company to try to halve the time it takes to grow a kingfish to restaurant size.
Instead of being kept in sea cages, Marcus Stehr from Clean Seas says the fish will live in onshore tanks at Arno Bay.
