Rudolph does a runner
There is grave news from the Northern Territory about Christmas.
It seems one of Santa's reindeer might have got lost on Lakefield Station just south of Mataranka.
Gary Riggs almost hit the animal while he was out on a bore run and says it is the first time he has ever seen a deer in the bush.
"I thought jingoes I wished I had a camera," he said.
"Anyway I got home and I called a meeting, and it was all the kids and everyone who's here and I said 'Santa's in a bit of a flap at the moment, he's a bit hot and bothered'.
