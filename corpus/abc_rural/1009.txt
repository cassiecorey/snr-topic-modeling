Cherry growers urged to support levy increase
Cherry growers say they are facing a tough season, with a lack of overseas markets and a forecast heavy crop.
New fruit fly protocols in Taiwan have closed that market and growers cannot get fruit into China, the US or New Zealand.
The industry now wants to increase its levy from one to eight cents a kilogram to fund research and development, marketing and promotions.
Trevor Ranford from Cherry Growers Australia hopes most growers will support the changes.
Efforts have begun to tackle fruit fly outbreaks on a national basis for the first time.
In the past, controlling the pest has been left up the states, but the horticulture sector believes there needs to be a more coordinated approach.
Plant Health Australia spokesman Kyle Thoms says there will be a meeting in Canberra next month to kick off the effort.
"There's been a lot of good work done that's been done over many years across all of the states, but this is going to give us a chance, this national program, to bring all those players together," he said.
