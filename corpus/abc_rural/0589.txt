Farmers welcome new transport subsidies
Farmers across New South Wales have welcomed the reintroduction of transport subsidies under a new drought package announced by the State Government.
An extra $5 million will be spent on the movement of stock, fodder and water, and fund drought support workers until the end of the year.
Ninety per cent of the state is now in drought or considered marginal.
New South Wales farmer Jock Laurie says the package goes a long way towards helping producers to get through the current crisis.
"Certainly it is a lot better than it was this time yesterday morning," he said.
"We have got to acknowledge the fact that the Government has moved reasonably quickly on this.
"One thing we want more than anything else is a big shower of rain.
