New regulations restrict animal health work to vets
Under proposed new animal welfare regulations in New South Wales, a range of routine animal health procedures will be restricted to vets.
From September 1, vets will be responsible for dehorning cattle, and mulesing sheep over a year old, and castrating cattle, sheep and goats over six months of age.
The new regulations also classify most equine dentistry as veterinary science, limiting equine dentists to basic teeth cleaning and rasping.
Master equine dentist and trainer Ian Wharton says the regulations will be devastating.
