SA growers to plant record crop
South Australian grain growers are set to plant a record area of crop after a good start to the season.
Authorities estimate plantings of around 3.83 million hectares, with 70 per cent already in the ground.
Primary Industries SA consultant Peter Fulwood says, with good conditions and yields, the crop could be worth up to $1.1 billion.
"We've had that earlier start, which has certainly encouraged farmers, and the price of wheat has certainly increased," he said.
"I think principally it's probably been the early start that has encouraged farmers to get in and put in an extra paddock here and there.
