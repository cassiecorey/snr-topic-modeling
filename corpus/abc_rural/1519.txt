Govt under fire over delay in delivering horticulture conduct code
Labor and the Greens have attacked the Federal Government for delays in implementing a code of conduct for the horticulture sector.
It has been almost 700 days since the Coalition made an election promise to introduce a mandatory code to improve transparency between growers and wholesalers.
A motion put forward yesterday by the Greens in the Senate, to clarify when the issue will be addressed, was narrowly defeated by the Coalition.
Greens Senator Christine Milne says that is a clear sign the Government is trying to renege on its promise.
"It's an absolute disgrace that they are now trying to find a way to make it some sort of rambling voluntary code," she said.
"The Greens believe that it should be a mandatory code, that's why we moved in the Senate to call on the Government to fulfil their election promise and what we're seeing is delay until after the Queensland election and I can almost bet my bottom dollar that they will come out with some gobbledly-gook about some voluntary codes next week."
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran is defending the delay.
"I realise there's great anger growing amongst many who believe that the mandatory code of conduct would be automatically be introduced, we're still working our way through all of the issues," he said.
