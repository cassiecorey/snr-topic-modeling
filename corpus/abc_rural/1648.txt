Drought behind yarding increase at Hay sale
The drought is prompting sheep producers in the New South Wales Riverina to send extra stock to the annual spring breeder sales.
The yarding for the Hay store merino sheep sale on Friday was up by 20 per cent to almost 55,000 head.
Graham Morphett from the Hay Merino Breeders Association says prices were well down on last year, but held up better than expected in such a dry season.
"The whole sale there was people ready to buy sheep, there was 500 people attended," he said.
