Row brews over european bumblebees plan
A row has erupted over a plan to import european bumblebees to mainland Australia.
While the horticulture sector says they could help boost production in greenhouse and hydroponic operations, environmentalists are worried about other impacts.
A Department of Environment and Heritage report released for public comment last week is considering the importation of bumblebees for controlled crop pollination.
Queensland greenhouse tomato grower David Da Pra says it would dramatically boost production.
"Bring higher pollination, which will give better fruit quality, better shelf life, more saleable fruit," he said.
The Wide Bay Conservation Council's Pam Soper wants further research into artificial pollination, strongly opposing the importation of the bumblebee.
