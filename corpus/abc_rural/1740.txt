SA grain harvest begins early
The grain harvest has started two weeks early in South Australia this year because of the lack of spring rain.
Ian Mudge from Telowie, near Port Pirie, has reaped 300 hectares of peas and barley so far and says despite very low yields, the grain is of reasonable quality.
However, he says not all of his crops will be worth harvesting and expects to be finished well before Christmas.
"I reckon we'll have most of November and December off. I think it's just one of those years that we'll just chalk up to experience and forget about and zip back next year and have another go," he said.
On the far west coast of the Eyre Peninsula, the Thevenard silos has also reported its first delivery of oats.
Meanwhile, the estimated value of South Australia's crop production has been slashed to $600 million, about half of what it was last year.
The grim outlook has prompted ABB Grain to close at least two silos over summer.
And operations manager Peter Weaver says other silos throughout the state could be added to the list.
