Water market does roaring trade
The water market in southern New South Wales is doing a roaring trade, as irrigators try to secure extra water for winter crops.
Internet trading company Waterfind says there was a 10-fold increase in water movement during August, with almost 30,000 megalitres sold in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys.
Prices have peaked at $350 a megalitre, with the average price closer to $150.
Brett Tucker from Murrumbidgee Irrigation says after six years of drought some producers are selling water for high prices, rather than using it themselves.
"You can't blame people for selling, there's been such a differential in the markets this year that I think the Murray valley's become more attractive," he said.
"Ultimately people need to do whatever they can to get through these sort of circumstances.
