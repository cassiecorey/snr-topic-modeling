Drought impacts on northern cattle prices
Cattle prices in tropical northern Australia are feeling the impact of the dry conditions elsewhere.
An oversupply of stock to the domestic markets is driving down prices across the nation and for the live export trade.
Steve Ellison, of the Territory's Live Exporters Association, says cattle prices have eased by 10 to 15 cents for every kilogram sold.
However he says there has been a big improvement in the buffalo export trade.
"I think price is a big factor, plus there are buffalo operators who are really well organised, they can get much bigger numbers on a regular basis and put them in yards and quieten them down prior to going on the ship," he said.
