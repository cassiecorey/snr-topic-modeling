Grain harvesters hit out at farmers' pay rates
Grain harvesters say some farmers are taking advantage of the drought conditions to reduce their pay.
The Australian Grain Harvesters Association says some large corporate farms in Queensland have dropped their pay rates from $14 dollars an acre to $10 dollars.
President Peter Bradley says despite contractors being desperate for work, there is no justification for paying less because of poor quality crops.
"The quality of the grain, whether it be good, bad or indifferent this year, is that there's so little grain around that the price of the grain has risen to double what they were getting last year and sometimes triple nearly," he said.
