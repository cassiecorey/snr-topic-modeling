Anger over latest drought assistance
Farm-related businesses are angry they have been left out of the Federal Government's extended drought assistance package.
An extra $560 million has been allocated to extend assistance to 10,000 more farmers in five states, on top of last week's $350 million announcement.
The president of the Australian Contract Harvesters Association, Peter Bradley, says agriculture-reliant businesses, like harvesters, are also struggling to survive the summer.
"We've been asking and asking and asking the Federal Government for some assistance, but it's got to the stage where it's totally and absolutely critical at this stage that we do at least get interest rate subsidies on our financing."
But the drought package has been welcomed by the National Farmers Federation and the Association of Rural Financial Counselling Services.
And the Country Womens Association president, Lesley Young, says the $4 million her organisation has received will allow it to revive emergency aid programs.
