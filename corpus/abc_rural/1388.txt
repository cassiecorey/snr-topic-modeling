EU bans contaminated rice imports
The European Union (EU) has stopped imports of US rice, which has been found to contain an unapproved genetically-engineered variety.
American authorities will have to prove rice shipments are free of GM traces, before they will be allowed in.
The EU's emergency measures follow discovery of tracts of experimental GE rice in US commercial supplies.
Germany's Bayer CropScience developed "LL Rice 601".
US Rice Federation spokesman David Coia claims the decision is preliminary.
"We're waiting for the final decision by the stating committee," he said.
"I think it's important to recognise that the US Food and Drug Administration has declared that the long grain rice variety in question is safe."
But the EU says its ban will last at least six months.
