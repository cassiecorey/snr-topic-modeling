Recycling scheme being commissioned
Tasmania's biggest water recycling scheme is being commissioned today to provide irrigation water to farms and golf courses.
More than 2,500 megalitres of treated sewage water will be diverted from the Derwent River.
City engineer John Stevens from Clarence Council says the $16 million scheme will prevent up to 80 tonnes of nitrogen and 25 tonnes of phosphorous ending up in the river each year.
He says so far 25 water users have signed up but with the current climate outlook, perceptions of recycled water are changing quickly.
