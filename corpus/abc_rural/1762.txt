Hundreds take oil concerns to Canberra
About a thousand people turned out in Canberra yesterday to send a message to the Federal Government that it needs to take urgent action to address climate change.
The words Clean Energy for Eternity were spelt out across Reconciliation Place.
Organiser Dr Matthew Nott, an orthopaedic surgeon from Bega, says that one of the critical problems facing rural communities, which are dependent on road transport, is oil depletion.
"Petrol's going to become much more expensive in the near future, we're going to be forced to become more self sufficient. and that is going to become more and more difficult as we get hotter and drier," Dr Nott said.
