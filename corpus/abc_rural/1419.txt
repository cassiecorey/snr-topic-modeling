Central Qld farmers predict bumper harvest
The wheat harvest has started in central Queensland, where growers are expecting a bumper 500,000 tonne harvest.
The latest forecast from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics predicts an 11 per cent drop from last year's near-record harvest of 40.5 million tonnes nationwide.
Consultant Pat McKee says it is the first time since the 2000 winter season that central Queensland farmers look like they will have an above-average crop.
"I think that even with the warm finish that the crops, particularly north of Emerald and north of Capella, will be quite good as far as quality is concerned," he said.
