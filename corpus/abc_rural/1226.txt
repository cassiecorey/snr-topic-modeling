Calls for former AWB lawyer to be cross-examined
AWB's former in-house lawyer Jim Cooper is likely to give evidence to the Federal Court tomorrow, as the Cole Inquiry seeks access to 1,300 documents that may be relevant to the oil-for-food investigation.
Barristers for the Commonwealth have told AWB they want to cross-examine Mr Cooper, who resigned in April.
