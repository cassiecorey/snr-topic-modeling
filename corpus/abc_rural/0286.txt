Critical months
Wheat exporter AWB says the next few months are critical for the global grain market, as weather conditions determine the size of the world crop.
Australian growers have already received a lower than expected return on the 2005-06 crop, largely due to fluctuating demands for hard wheat varieties and tough international marketing conditions.
And general manager of AWB International, Sarah Scales, says global demand remains subdued.
"I think the next couple of months are very critical, I think it's make or break as far as the world wheat market goes for the next 12 months, depending on particularly rain conditions in the hard red winter wheat belt of the United States," she said.
