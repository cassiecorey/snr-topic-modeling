Pearl farm purchase 'positive sign for industry'
There are changes under way in Australia's pearling industry, with a major distributor and marketing company buying its first pearl farm.
The Autore group has paid $15 million for Broome-based Clipper Pearls.
Brett McCallum from the Pearl Producers Association says after a tough few years in the sector, the deal has injected a bit of confidence in the sector.
"I think that someone like Autore who is as close to the market and as close to the pearling world as he is, has obviously got great confidence in investing a significant amount of money in this industry," he said.
