Lamb production springs to new high
Australian lamb production hit a new record during the first three months of 2006, despite challenging seasonal conditions.
Meat and Livestock Australia says the average jump of 8 per cent came as a surprise, with the biggest gains in Victoria and WA, where there is a continuing shift away from growing wool.
Despite the growing stock numbers, exports are up and prices remain just 10 per cent under the all-time highs.
Grazier Peter Small from Victoria's western district, says it breaks his heart to turn away from wool, but there is a lot more money to be made out of lamb.
"Well it is what we have done but we are reluctant to do it," he said.
