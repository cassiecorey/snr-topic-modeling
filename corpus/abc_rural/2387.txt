Aust vegetable imports outweigh export, growers say
Vegetable growers say Australia is importing far more produce than it exports.
Most of the surge has been for frozen and processed vegetables, particularly potatoes.
Peak grower body Ausveg says imports have jumped by almost 35 per cent in the last four years, to $375 million.
Ausveg spokesman Ian James says the trend is concerning, especially when vegetable exports have dropped back because of a loss of markets.
"Some of these frozen vegetables reflect renewed or different sourcing policies of the food processors in Australia, in particular, over the last 12 months anyway, a switch from Australian-sourced product to New Zealand-sourced product," he said.
"But there has also been some substantial increases in imports coming from the European Union as well."
