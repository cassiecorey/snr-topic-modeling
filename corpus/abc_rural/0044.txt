Aquatic weed to be tested overseas
An invasive aquatic weed is proving extremely hard to eradicate from the Northern Territory.
Cabomba has been discovered in the remote coastal community of Gove.
Further west, the Darwin River has been found to be the only place in the nation where the weed is producing viable seed.
Regional weed officer Steve Wingrave says that explains the rapid spread of the weed along 11 kilometres of the river.
"It's an ornamental plant, the same as roses or any plant you have in your garden," he said.
"Lots of them are hybrid varieties so they are not going to produce viable seeds.
"It turns out that we have got a variety which is producing viable seed. But it mightn't be a result of the variety we have got.
