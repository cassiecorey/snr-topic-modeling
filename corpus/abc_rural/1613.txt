Rain helps Kangaroo Is farmers
There is one part of southern Australia that seems to be faring better than most.
Farmers on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia say early winter rain has pulled them through.
Even though the island had its driest winter on record, Kingscote farmer Rodney Bell says his crops are still on track and he has never seen his livestock looking so good.
