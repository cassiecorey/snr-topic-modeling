McGauran approves non-AWB wheat export contracts
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has approved two wheat export contracts for companies other than AWB.
One of the contracts is for 300,000 tonnes for Wheat Australia to ship wheat to Iraq, where AWB has been banned from trading and one for Western Australian-based CBH of 500,000 tonnes to Indonesia.
Mr McGauran says of the 46 applications received they were the only two considered to be in the public interest.
He says AWB has given assurances the two applications will not have an impact on national pool returns.
As a condition of the export permits, both Wheat Australia and CBH must contribute $4 a tonne to the national pool up to a total of 800,000 tonnes.
Meanwhile, the head of AWB International has warned the Federal Government he will have no other choice than to wind up the company, if its veto over wheat exports is removed permanently.
AWB International chairman Ian Donges says the Government must be careful in what it decides.
"I think a lot of commentary has been around," he said.
"We can have the the bulk veto powers with someone else and have a permit system along side a single desk system.
"Quite clearly you can't do that.
"If the single desk closes down or in fact changes to the point where we don't have a future for the say [in] the 2007 pool then we will phase out of business.
