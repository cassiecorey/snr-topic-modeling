Age no barrier to competitive wood chopping
Competitive wood chopping might be considered a young bloke's game but an 84-year-old Tasmanian has shown age is no barrier.
Retired tree feller and former wood chop title holder Henry Munday was a crowd favourite at the Hamilton Show north of Hobart at the weekend.
While he took almost five minutes longer than his competitors in the wood chop, he got there in the end, with the help of an old mate.
"That's an old plum axe, one of the old American plums, it's like me, it's pretty old," he said.
"But it's not a big axe, I don't use real big axes.
"I'm not strong enough now like those other big fellas out there to use big heavy axes so I use the lighter one.
