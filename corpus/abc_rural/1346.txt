Turnbull urges private water infrastructure investment
There is a call today for more private investment to help solve the nation's water shortages and fix ailing infrastructure.
The federal Parliamentary Secretary for Water, Malcolm Turnbull, has released a discussion paper which includes a national set of guidelines for working with the private sector.
He admits there have been problems with partnerships between the public and private arenas, but says there are major opportunities.
"I don't think many people would support, for example, privatising catchment management authorities or privatising dams or the sources of water," he said.
