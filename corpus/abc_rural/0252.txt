Wine grapes dumped as oversupply woes hit growers
Tens of thousands of tonnes of Riverland wine grapes will be dumped on the ground or left to rot on the vine this season because of the national oversupply.
The South Australian growers have been left with no market for their fruit after some had contracts suspended, while others were not able to renew their agreements with wineries.
The region's lost income could total $65 million.
Loxton grower Glenn Arnold says the situation is desperate.
"We're just trying to survive," he said.
"Everybody says there's swings and roundabout and you know good times are followed by bad times, bad times are usually followed by good times ... we've just got to hang in there.
