Canberra bushfires report damning
Landholders west of Canberra who warned authorities about the impending fire danger in early 2003 say they have been vindicated by an investigation into the subsequent bushfires.
The ACT coroner has released a damning report on poor preparation and fire management for the blaze, which killed four people and injured 400 others.
One of the report's major recommendations is that the Emergency Services Agency be reinstated as an independent body that is not answerable to bureaucrats.
Val Jeffery, a long-term firefighter who is credited with saving his village of Tharwa, says someone should be held responsible for the disaster.
"There's a stark lesson here for the rest of Australia," he said.
