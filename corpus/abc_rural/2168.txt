Biodiesel plant opens
A $48 million biodiesel plant has been officially opened in Darwin today.
It is initially expected to annually produce 150 million litres of biodiesel using imported palm oil.
Natural Fuels managing director Dick Selwood says work is under way to develop a Territory soya bean industry to supplement the feedstock.
