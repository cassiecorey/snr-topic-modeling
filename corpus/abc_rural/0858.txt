Swimmers avoid crocs in lake record attempt
Six Sydneysiders swam into the record books over the weekend, crossing Australia's largest man made lake in Western Australia's Kimberley region.
Their efforts crossing Lake Argyle raised $80,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
Swimmer Jon Attwater, from Balmoral, says it took them 19 hours over three days and thankfully they did not spot a crocodile through their goggles.
"We didn't have any face-to-face confrontations which we were very glad of, Mr Attwater said.
"We do a lot of ocean swimming and we swim around in the sea with probably a lot more sharks than we're ever likely to see crocodiles here, but we were very concerned about meeting up with a crocodile, we've only seen pictures of them in movies and they don't look very nice."
