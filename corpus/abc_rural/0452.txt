Digging finally under way at new gold mine
On the back of record prices, another gold mine has opened in Western Australia.
Tanami Gold has begun work at the Coyote project in the Tanami Desert, south-east of Halls Creek.
There have been delays to starting the desert operation because of the wet season.
With the price of gold above $880, Tanami chairman Dennis Waddell is relieved to be finally digging.
"We've had plenty of rain and that has just delayed access more than anything, but we've made that up," he said.
"We started mining on Friday, which was a pretty momentous day. The excavators and dump trucks arrived last week and we took the first bucket of ore out on Friday afternoon."
