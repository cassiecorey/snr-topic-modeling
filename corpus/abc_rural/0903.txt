Honeymoon mine proposal meets more opposition
The proposed Honeymoon uranium mine near Broken Hill has been met with more opposition, with submissions on the project closing today.
Friends of the Earth says the South Australian Government will be going back on an election promise if it allows the mine to go ahead.
Anti-nuclear campaigner Joel Catchlove says the mine is a risky, short-term operation.
"By supporting it, it puts the Rann Government in quite a difficult situation. Because as there simply isn't a mine at Honeymoon at the moment they're both threatening to break their binding SA platform for government and also it goes against their election promises," he said.
"If you've got a four to six years of operation yet it could be permanent ground water contamination in that area."
