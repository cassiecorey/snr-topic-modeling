Rural women's isolation a key topic in youth survey
The isolation of women has emerged as a big issue in a national survey of youth in rural Australia this week.
Workshops are being held in five states as part of the Year of the Outback, to identify key issues and find some answers.
Coordinator Fiona Campbell-Maybury, says women want some kind of network to help them get access to resources.
"They are not necessarily suggesting that the resources are not there, what they're suggesting is that they're not necessarily aware of them," she said.
