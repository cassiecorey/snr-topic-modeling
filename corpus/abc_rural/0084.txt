Dairy companies compete for suppliers
Competition for milk suppliers is intensifying between dairy companies in Victoria.
After years of dismal prices, milk company Fonterra is now offering a sweetener of a 50 cent per kilogram premium to new suppliers.
Doug Chant from the Victorian Farmers Federation is happy with the higher prices, but he is worried the incentives will not give farmers long-term financial security.
