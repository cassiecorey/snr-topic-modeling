SA and NSW govts reach water trading agreement
The South Australian and New South Wales governments have signed an agreement to allow cross-border trading of water entitlements from the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers.
Earlier this year the Federal Government threatened to fine the two states $17 million if they did not reach an agreement by January.
South Australian Minister for the River Murray Karlene Maywald is hopeful this deal will avoid any penalties.
"We've come a long way since earlier this year in relation to the negotiations and the discussion," she said.
