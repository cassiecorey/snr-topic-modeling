Graincorp to keep some grain receival sites open
Graincorp has agreed not to axe 23 of the 108 grain receival sites earmarked for closure as part of its business rationalisation plan in the eastern states.
Following the announcement of silo closures earlier this year, Graincorp agreed to further negotiation with silo committees, who vowed to fight to keep their local silos open.
The company has confirmed they will keep seven of the 23 sites open for a year in Victoria and three in central Queensland.
It is not yet known what other sites across New South Wales will remain open and how much the move will cost the company.
Graincorp is expected to release further details tomorrow.
In Victoria, the Wimmera has been the most persuasive, saving four of eight sites earmarked for closure.
Ron Jackson, from Patchewollock in the Mallee region, says it is only a 12 month reprieve.
