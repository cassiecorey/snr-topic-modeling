NT fishermen reach buyout deal
Up to six northern prawn trawling licences may have been bought back by the Federal Government.
Darwin fishermen Tony Thiel says he is relieved to have reached a deal in the first round of the national industry buyout.
He has been unable to sell 10 tonnes of banana prawns caught earlier this year.
But Mr Thiel says restructuring would not have been necessary, if the Government had done more to limit imports of cheaper inferior prawns.
"I don't believe they will need restructuring any more. What our problem is, they can't sell the product and that is the main thing now," he said.
"They could stop imports. They stopped it in the states, the industry, the fishermen stopped it importing and duping of prawns."
Meanwhile, Australia's patagonian tooth fishermen have rejected calls to close down the fishery.
This week, two illegal fishermen were fined more than $100,000 for poaching.
The Australian Conservation Foundation says the penalty is no deterrent and a worldwide ban on the sale of the toothfish would be more effective.
But Les Scott from Petuna Sealord says that would punish responsible operators.
