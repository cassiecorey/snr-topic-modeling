Arid zone research group research to focus on desert areas
Pastoralists and researchers from around the country have taken the first step towards creating a new arid zone research group.
The group will work independently of state and territory organisations, focusing on problems that affect pastoral production in all desert areas.
Mark Ashley from the 21st Century Pastoral Program says initial research will focus on reducing input costs and improving technology for the wool and beef industries.
"As it stands at the moment most of the state agencies are focused with their particular industry," he said.
"A lot of these issues are big issues, they go across state boundaries.
