Beazley tours NSW drought affected areas
Federal Labor leader Kim Beazley has begun a tour of central New South Wales to hear first hand how the drought is hurting rural families.
Mr Beazley has used the trip to make his first announcement on drought policy,
He visited three properties near Forbes in the central west of New South Wales and will be shown the Jemmalong Irrigation Scheme, which this year has a zero water allocation.
Young farmers highlighted the difficulties they are encountering in remaining viable and told Mr Beazley about their failed crops, many of which were to be irrigated.
The Labor leader told the producers if his party were elected, it would set up a series of research institutes to help commercialise technology to better manage the drought.
