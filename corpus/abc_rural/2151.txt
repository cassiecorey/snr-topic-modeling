Scientists claim new water filter halves purification costs
Scientists in Italy say they have developed new ways of filtering water that should halve the cost of purification.
The water membrane technology is already being used in other countries to recycle waste, make bore water palatable and desalinate salty water.
Professor Enrico Drioli from the University of Calabria says the membranes, which look like plastic wrap, mirror the natural filtering membranes in our bodies.
"Just a film that the one you can use for packaging your sandwich sometimes, so this film is able to be selective," he said.
