Coles backs inland rail link proposal
Coles Myer has backed plans for an inland rail link between Brisbane and Melbourne but supporters of the project say that is not enough to get it off the ground.
The head of the Australian Transport and Energy Corridor, Everald Compton, says governments will be the key to the $4 billion rail network.
Coles Myer has lodged a submission to a Productivity Commission inquiry into the nation's freight system, saying the inland project would help to make rail more efficient.
But Mr Compton says it is now in the hands of government.
"The Coles Myer thing won't make any difference because other people have said that before," he said.
"For instance, Woolworths said it some years ago and governments took no notice of them."
