Govt seeks to strike balance over chemical restrictions
The Federal Government is asking the public whether there should be tighter restrictions on around 80 chemicals widely used in agriculture to try to prevent them being used by terrorists.
Attorney-General Philip Ruddock says the Bali bombings show that terrorists are looking for readily accessible chemicals which are easy to use.
Farmers are opposing the changes regarding chemicals used in fertilisers, sprays, grain fumigants and livestock production, saying there are already industry restrictions in place.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Government will try to strike a balance between security concerns and the impact on farmers.
"High risk chemicals are not so freely available as the public might think at present anyway," he said.
