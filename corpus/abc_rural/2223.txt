Fishermen plead with consumers to buy local
With Christmas less than a month away, Queensland fishermen have pleaded for consumers to buy local seafood over the holiday period.
Mackay operator Ruth Amos is struggling to compete with cheaper imported products and is asking shoppers to consider the origin of the seafood they buy.
"It's not that much dearer and you are supporting local jobs," she said.
