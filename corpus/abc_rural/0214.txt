Researchers aiming for safe Q-fever vaccine
Scientists at James Cook University in Queensland are working to develop an alternative vaccine for Q-fever, which will not produce debilitating side effects.
Q-fever is a highly infectious disease usually caught after contact with affected animals, which causes flu-like symptoms and can be fatal.
The university's Ray Layton says the new vaccine will be developed over the next six to eight months.
"In fact it's one of the only vaccines out there at the moment where you need to be screened before you're vaccinated to make sure you can actually be vaccinated without too many adverse affects and that probably stems I think from the fact that they culture this organism in chicken eggs, and a lot of people have adverse reactions to those egg yolk antigens," he said.
