Rice farmers back in production
After years of low water allocations and tough growing conditions, rice farmers in southern New South Wales are relieved to be back on their harvesters this month.
During the drought, many farmers thought they had grown their last crop but with growing demand for rice, more growers are returning to the crop.
Rice grower Tim McKindley, at Caldwell near Deniliquin, says providing there is enough water around, rice has a good future.
