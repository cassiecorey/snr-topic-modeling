Cattle, worker shortage blamed for early abattoir closure
Australia's second largest meat processor Teys Brothers is blaming a lack of cattle and a chronic labour shortage for its decision to close its abattoir in far north Queensland three-and-a-half months early.
The Innisfail meatworks normally closes for the wet season in December.
One hundred and sixty workers will be affected, and chief executive Brad Teys says the company will try to relocate them to other plants, and move cattle by train to southern abattoirs.
