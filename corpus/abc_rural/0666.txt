Violence hits E Timorese agriculture
East Timor's agriculture sector has been seriously affected by recent violence.
Fires, looting and mayhem in the capital Dili have destroyed eight years of research and documentation.
The price of fresh fruit and vegetables has also sky-rocketed.
Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Estanislau Da Silva, also fears coffee exports could be down by more than half.
"Now we are in the coffee season. It's the harvesting coffee season and this can have a tremendous impact on the livelihood and the people who depend on coffee," he said.
