Oxiana to expand Prominent Hill mine
Oxiana Limited says it will spend $775 million developing the Prominent Hill copper gold mine in South Australia into one of the nation's biggest copper producers.
The mine, which is 120 kilometres from Olympic Dam, was discovered in 2001.
It is widely considered to be the find of the decade.
