Zinifex and Umicore link for zinc
Australia's largest lead and zinc miner will combine its smelting assets with a Belgian company to become the world's biggest producer of zinc alloy.
Zinifex has signed a memorandum of understanding with Umicore to form a global company to produce 1.2 million tonnes of zinc and alloys a year.
Zinifex says it wants to concentrate on mining, but spokesman Martin MacFarlane says existing smelter operations in Hobart and Port Pirie will not be affected.
"Those businesses tomorrow will continue on much as they have today, there's no change to any of the employees terms and conditions for the short to medium term future - we see the business will be very much as it is today," he said.
"Longer term, however, it may create and open opportunities that may not have been otherwise available just from the fact that Zinifex did not wish to develop that side of the business."
