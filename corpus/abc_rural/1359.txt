WA drought package targets farmers
West Australian farmers are hoping for rain this week and also have some financial relief in sight, with the State Government unveiling a $5 million drought package.
Farmers in the worst-hit northern agricultural areas can apply for grants of up to $7,500.
The state Opposition wants the help provided to the wider community.
