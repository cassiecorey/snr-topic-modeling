Drought claims grain exporter
Best Western Commodities, a major container grain exporter at Grenfell in New South Wales, has appointed an administrator after business slowed due to the drought.
The company says there are no outstanding debts to farmers or carriers but there are a number of major creditors.
Patrick Haire, from the Rural Market and Supply Association, says farmers should check out all of the organisations they are doing business with.
"Our members encourage farmers to come and sit down, and talk with them if there are any concerns by growers about the merchants they are dealing with," he said.
