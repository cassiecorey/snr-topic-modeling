Growers satisfied with grape prices
Riverland grape growers who supply to wine giant McGuigan Simeon say they are satisfied with the fruit prices determined by an independent analyst.
The analyst was called in after a dispute arose over prices for grapes, many which had already been delivered to the winery.
Chris Byrne, from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association, says growers had been expecting to receive the lowest price.
