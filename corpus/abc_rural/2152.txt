AWB's profit drops
Wheat exporter AWB has announced a 68 per cent cent fall in annual net profit to $58.1million.
The company says it will pay a reduced final dividend of 4 cents, with the drought cutting the harvest and less domestic grain trading.
The oil-for-food inquiry has cost the company almost $24 million, while redundancies and restructuring has taken $10 million off the bottom line.
Managing director Gordon Davis says AWB will remain viable if it loses control of the single desk for wheat exports in the wake of the Cole inquiry.
"AWB has been pursuing a strategy of diversifying its income away from pool management. We've got strong and growing business in our international trading in Geneva, Brazil and India," Mr Davis said.
