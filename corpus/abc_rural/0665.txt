Grain growers told to stop sowing crops
Western Australian grain growers are being told to stop sowing crops because there is no rain in sight for at least two weeks.
Many farmers have already planted a good percentage of their crops and state authorities say they need to assess their financial position.
Peter Metcalf from the Department of Agriculture in Geraldton says it is time to pull up the seeders and start making a plan for the rest of this season.
"What tends to happen in this situation, which is a very unusual situation, most growers haven't previously been in this state, or these conditions previously, is that you start the program and you continue on," he said.
