Hundreds of stock horses to gather for Polocrosse World Cup
Up to 200 Australian stock horses will be drafted for next year's Polocrosse World Cup in Queensland.
The event will see eight international teams play over a 10-day period in April, at Warwick on the Darling Downs.
World Cup chief horse coordinator, Kent Wells, said it is the nation's biggest recruitment of horses in peacetime.
"Every state will have some," he said.
