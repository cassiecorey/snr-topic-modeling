Competition will cut farmers' market share: study
A new report says in the next 10 years Australian farmers will lose market share to developing countries like China, Brazil and India.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations have compared 15 commodities.
They have found that as developing nations increase production and become more competitive, countries like the US, EU and Australia will lose out in world agricultural trade.
Australian exports of sugar, beef, rice and pigmeat will be hardest hit, with less impact on wheat and poultry.
Trade analyst Peter Gallagher says although world trade rules will play a part, global export competition is on the rise.
"The world is not beating a path to our door looking for primary products," he said.
"The opportunities for Australia are now going to be much more in the processed food area and in the fresh foods and ingredients areas.
"It is important that we realise many developing countries are becoming more effective producers of primary products and we need to look at the structure of our own production for the future."
