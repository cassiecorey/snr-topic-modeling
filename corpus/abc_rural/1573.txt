Wheat virus spreads
The destructive wheat streak mosaic virus is rapidly spreading across Western Australia.
Western Australia's Department of Agriculture banned wheat imports from the eastern states earlier this year to try to stop the disease entering the state.
That ban was lifted when it was discovered after the virus was found in a commercial crop.
Department spokesman Roger Jones says for the first time, the virus is now being found in crops across the wheatbelt.
"It is a very serious disease if there's widespread infection with the virus in young plants, young wheat plants," he said.
