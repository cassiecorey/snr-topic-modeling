NT growers brand small mango trays a flop
New, smaller trays used to transport mangoes have been branded a failure by many growers in the Northern Territory.
The major supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths introduced the 12 per layer trays to reduce handling.
But they are estimated to have cost Territory packing houses more than $2 million, which is not being recouped in the marketplace.
Karl Gygar from Pinata Marketings says the supermarkets will have to accept the trays are not working.
"Customers are looking at these boxes and thinking that they're either rejects from Coles and Woolworths, and so obviously not worth a premium price," he said.
"I know for a fact that a lot of Queensland growers have cancelled their 12 per layer box orders just due to the reaction in the market."
