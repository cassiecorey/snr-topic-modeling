Demand for bananas prompts desperate measures
Competition to find enough bananas is heating up in New South Wales as prices continue to hover well over $100 a carton.
Before cyclone Larry wiped out the north Queensland crop, growers in New South Wales were receiving under $10 a carton.
Coffs Harbour grower Mick Gentle says growers are receiving constant phone calls from agents looking for more fruit and one has even bought a local plantation to ensure supply.
