Black wattle tree research may help in greenhouse gas fight
New research into black wattle trees may help the fight against greenhouse gases.
Scientists at the Victorian Department of Primary Industries are trialling compounds found in black wattle, as part of research on reducing methane emissions from cows.
The compounds are known as "tannins" and are being trialled in a new drench that has the ability to change the way cows digest feed.
Scientist Martin Auldist says previous trials have found the tannins cut methane emissions from sheep.
"Overseas studies have shown that tannins from black wattle can reduce methane emission by about 13 per cent," he said.
