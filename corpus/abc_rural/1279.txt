Single desk changes 'would hit AWB shares'
Investment banker JP Morgan says shares in wheat exporter AWB could drop to $2.80, if the company loses control of the single desk for wheat exports.
Shares fell last week to $3.36, which is lower than the company's debut price on the Australian Stock Exchange.
An analysis by the banker also shows that AWB's share value would hover around $4 a share if it held onto the single desk but more competitors were allowed to sell wheat overseas.
Greg Canavan, a senior equities analyst from Fat Prophets, says that is not surprising given AWB's experience in wheat sales.
"When you look at the whole structure of the market AWB, given its monopoly position, does have a very big market share," he said.
"If it didn't have to give that market share up then it would still be in competition with the other players coming in.
