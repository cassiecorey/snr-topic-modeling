Chiquita takeover stalls
A takeover bid for the major food processor and wholesaler Chiquita Brands South Pacific has been stalled.
Tradefresh, a joint venture between Timbercorp and the Cost Group, has managed to acquire control of the company with 78 per cent ownership.
But plans to de-list the company from the stock exchange cannot go ahead because investment company MMC Contrarian is not likely to sell its 12 per cent stake.
Tradefresh and Chiquita chairman Robert Costa says he is disappointed at MMC's stance.
"Our original intention was to secure 100 per cent of the company, that's still our intention," he said.
"Now we know that's not going to happen in the short term because we have a significant shareholder in MMC, who at this stage are not selling and that's their prerogative."
Chiquita has interests in the blueberry, banana, mushroom and citrus sectors.
