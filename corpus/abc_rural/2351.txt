Mother of injured horse rider backs hard hats
The Northern Territory's outback community is rallying around a severely injured campdrafter.
Quita Docking is recovering from a head injury she received four years ago, when she was crushed by her horse.
In a miraculous recovery, she has left her wheelchair and learnt to walk, and ride again.
Mother Gladys Docking says she is grateful for local support which helped to send Quita to Germany for stem cell therapy.
She also wants to encourage all riders to wear hard hats.
"Quita was always against it, as a teenager. I was always, always trying to get her to wear it," she said.
"[She] never would, but [I continue to encourage use], now more so than ever. Quita would still have suffered injuries, but they would have been minimised.
"It doesn't take much to have a bit of a hot head for a couple of hours, you can take it off when you are off the horse.
