Export markets go feral over turn-off label for goat meat
The goat industry is being urged to ditch the term "feral" and relabel its meat to Australian "rangeland" goat.
While there has been a big jump in the number of farmed meat goats in Australia, at least half of the country's exports still come from the feral goat population in semi-arid rangeland country.
John Hayes, from the Wodonga abattoir, which exports to the US, says the term feral is a big turn-off for overseas buyers.
