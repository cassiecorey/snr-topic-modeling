Pricey pup fetches new record
What price would you pay for a good working dog?
Well you can expect to dig even deeper after a Victorian bred kelpie fetched $5,400 over the weekend.
Tasmanian farmer Neil Monks bought the 20-month-old pup sight unseen, and had no qualms at forking out an Australian record amount for the dog, Bagalla Mick.
"The way I look at it there's no limit on the value of a good dog," he said.
