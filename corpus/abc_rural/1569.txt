Victoria joins MIS tax fight
The Victorian Government has joined the fight to save tax incentives for managed investment schemes (MIS).
The Federal Government is considering a crack down on the tax breaks, which allow investors to claim 100 per cent tax relief from projects like timber plantation developments.
Victorian Regional Development Minister John Brumby says the Federal Government needs to consult with stakeholders and clearly outline the proposed changes before pushing through new legislation.
"We've seen something like $321 million invested in Victoria over the past four years," he said.
