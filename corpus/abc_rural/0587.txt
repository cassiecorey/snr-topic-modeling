Australians to train Malaysian abattoir staff
There is expected to be improved animal welfare standards at new cattle abattoir and training centre being built in Australia's second largest live export market, Sabah in Malaysia.
The facility is expected to process up to 10,000 cattle from the Northern Territory.
Robert McFarlane, from the Department of Primary Industries, says it will be built to Australian standards.
"They will hopefully be able to processing, 70 or 80 or anything up to 100 a day if they want to, in due time," he said.
"The object is to train people and then we step back and allow them to carry on training they're own people.
