Research to investigate fish movements
Marine scientists say it is too early to tell whether climate change is responsible for a new mix of marine species being found in Tasmanian waters.
Increasing numbers of southern Australian fish are being discovered off Tasmania's coastline.
Two silver drummers were recently caught for the first time off the wharf at Stanley in the state's north-west.
CSIRO scientist Dr Peter Last says research is being carried out into whether climate change and warmer water is the cause.
"It turns out that something like 10 per cent of the species that we have in the coastal areas of Tasmania have moved further south," he said.
