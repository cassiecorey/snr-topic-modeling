Compost access hits mushroom growers
Half of Queensland's mushroom growers say they are facing closure because they can not access locally-produced compost.
The state's largest supplier, Darling Downs Mushrooms, will shut its plant near Toowoomba next month.
It is owned by multinational company Chiquita, and provides more than 20 of Queensland's growers with compost, a vital ingredient for mushroom production.
Withcott producer Bruce White is accusing Chiquita of trying to squeeze small growers out of the market.
