Competition hots up at Beef 2006
It is another huge day at Beef 2006 in Rockhampton in central Queensland.
There is very serious business taking place, amid the trade fair rodeos and the sinking of a few ales.
It is the biggest stud beef cattle ever held in Australia with over 30 breeds on show.
The prime cattle competition was won by Ken McKenzie of Yaralla, near Blackwater in central Queensland.
