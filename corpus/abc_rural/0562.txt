US cattlemen losing confidence in Japanese market
The US-based National Cattlemen's Beef Association says it is losing confidence in the Japanese market with its refusal to set a timetable to reopen the beef trade.
Spokesman Jay Truitt says the US has done all it can to reassure Japan that American beef is safe.
But Japanese authorities now want to do their own inspections of US meatworks after a prohibited shipment, including spinal bones, made it to Japan in January.
While he is still hoping for the market to reopen soon, Mr Truitt says Japan is a less reliable market for US producers.
"Our focus in the future is going to be more towards Korea, existing markets like Mexico and Canada, frankly, which is the fourth largest existing market for the United States and other countries around the Pacific rim," he said.
Despite the uncertainty, some reports suggest Japan could resume imports of US beef in July.
Following talks last week, Japanese experts have reportedly told US authorities they are "basically content" with measures to protect shipments from mad cow disease.
Meat and Livestock Australia's regional manager in Tokyo Samantha Jamieson says the July start date is sooner the expected but should not cause alarm for Australian producers.
