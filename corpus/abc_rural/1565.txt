Veg industry outlines growth plans
The vegetable industry will aim to double the value of its fresh, processed and packaged vegetables by 2020.
A strategic plan for the industry has been launched this morning in Canberra, just over a year after farmers rallied on the lawns of Parliament House to complain about the impact of cheap imports on their farm businesses.
Tasmanian farmer and campaigner Richard Bovill says the plan aims to improve communication between everyone in the supply chain, from growers to consumers.
"In the past we've focussed on fixing up problems," he said.
"This strategic plan looks to opportunities and looks to investing in creating opportunities. We have to grow the business.
