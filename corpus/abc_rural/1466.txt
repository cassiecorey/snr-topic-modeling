Quarantine protocols hit fruit, vegetable growers
The Australian Horticultural Exporters Association says it has never been harder or more expensive to send fruit and vegetables overseas.
It says the value of horticulture exports has fallen $230 million, or 30 per cent, since 2003.
Deputy chair David Minnis says tougher quarantine protocols imposed by other countries are taking their toll.
"Just about any fruit that's host for fruit fly - so mangoes, table grapes, stonefruit, cherries, apples, pears, citrus - all of these fruits have restrictions put on their movement into a whole range of countries," he said.
