Cloned animal products may reach US shelves
Consumers in the US may see meat and dairy products from cloned animals on their supermarket shelves next year.
The US Food and Drug Administration has submitted draft recommendations to Washington, which appear to support the sale of products from cloned animals, quoting research that says the food will be as safe as that from conventionally-bred animals.
The sale of cloned animal product is currently prohibited in the US.
But Scott Kinnear, from the Biological Farmers of Australia, says organic farmers are watching the issue with concern.
"We don't think that cloned foods are necessarily safe for the long-term," he said.
