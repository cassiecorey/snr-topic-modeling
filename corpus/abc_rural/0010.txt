Snails used in cancer research
New research is under way to investigate whether South Australian sea snails could eventually be used to treat cancer.
Until now the state's snail population has been virtually unexplored but Flinders University hopes to discover beneficial compounds in predatory sea snails, known as whelks.
Marine biologist Dr Kirsten Benkendorff says the work follows research overseas, where clinical trials are now investigating anti-cancer properties.
"The whelks that I'm looking at at the moment are not currently harvested and not really considered a useful resource so I think that there's a lot of potential economic benefits from that side of things," she said.
