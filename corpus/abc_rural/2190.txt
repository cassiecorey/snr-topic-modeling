Dairy Australia elects new president
A dairy farmer from Bega in southern New South Wales has been appointed chairman of the peak industry body, Dairy Australia.
Max Roberts will replace Pat Rowley to lead the farmer-funded research and development organisation.
Mr Roberts says $57 million in levy money was spent last year to help farmers survive the drought and fight for their rights.
"Our leadership role is [to ensure] the farmers have good information and water again is another good example as the dairy industry is probably the biggest single user in agriculture of water," he said.
"We've got to be able to defend our position and make sure our arguments are good and sound because there's a lot of competition for that water."
Farmers will be asked to vote on three levy options early next year.
Because of the drought, Dairy Australia is asking them to maintain the current levy rate rather than increase it.
Mr Rowley represented dairy farmers at a state, national and international level for more than 30 years.
He also helped create the peak body five years ago and says he is sorry to be leaving at such a testing time.
"I'm sure the industry will no doubt get through this drought and it always rains at the end of a drought, but there will be some people who will struggle very hard and that is sad to me as I go, but it wouldn't matter when I decided to go, there would be some challenge somewhere," Mr Rowley said.
