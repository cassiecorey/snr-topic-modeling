Truck crash prompts stock movements warning
Police in New South Wales are warning drivers to be more careful on country roads, after a crash involving a cement truck and a mob of 5,000 sheep.
The mob was being run along a stock route in the state's central-west.
Detective Senior Constable Andrew McGrath says police believe the driver ignored stock warning signs.
"A vehicle travelling on a road about 15 kilometres from Condobolin collided with a mob of sheep that were being driven along the road, with 15 fatalities," he said.
"The driver of the truck I believe will be issued with an infringement notice for failing to give way to stock.
"Because the conditions have been so dry there are a lot of mobs moving around on the roads so people should be wary when they are travelling on country roads.
