Demand for alpaca wool increasing
If you have got an alpaca or two running around the backyard, you are being urged to shear it and sell the fleece.
The industry's marketing body says there has been a big jump in demand for alpaca fibre which cannot be met.
John Bentley, from the Australian Alpaca Association, says because the animals are valued as pets, or guard animals, there is less focus on their fleece.
"The value is still highly in the animal, which tends to make the fleece at this point in time, more a by-product, but we do have to get the product out there to the public, get them familiar with alpaca," he said.
