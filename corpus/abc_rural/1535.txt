Gold milling resumes at Pine Creek
In resources news, gold is again being milled at Pine Creek in the Northern Territory, after three years.
Blasting starts today at the high grade, underground Brock's Creek mine, but GBS Gold is already milling old stockpiles to check the machinery.
Operations manager Tom Heaton expects to initially process 1.5 million tonnes of ore every year, recovering 150,000 ounces of gold.
"The mainstays of this operation for 10 years are two main projects, one of which is Maud Creek which is the refractory material, that has a life of around about ten years," he said.
