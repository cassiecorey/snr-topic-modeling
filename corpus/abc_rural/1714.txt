Truss expecting to discuss trade issues from Aust
Australia's new Trade Minister Warren Truss says he expects to travel far less than his predecessor Mark Vaile.
Mr Vaile has left the trade position to focus on transport and domestic issues surrounding the future of the Nationals.
Mr Truss says he is hoping he can do far more future trade negotiations from Australia.
"It will be necessary to talk to people in other parts of the world but I still regard very much my responsibilities to my own electorate, to the people of Australia as a high priority," he said.
