Wheat belt communities tackle achohol-related deaths
Communities in WA's wheat belt are trying to halt the growing number of alcohol-related deaths in the region.
The Wheatbelt Public Health Unit will work with the police to make drinking venues safer by training bar staff to stop serving customers when they have had enough.
Spokeswoman Julia Dick says most people would be shocked at just how many people are killed by alcohol each year.
"Probably about 15 deaths a year in the wheat belt are attributable to alcohol. There's about a further 2000 people hospitalised each year because of excessive alcohol use," she said.
"It comes at a financial cost of about $5.5 million, which is an enormous amount of money.
