NZ farmers encouraged to head to Tassie
Representatives of a Tasmanian council are in New Zealand at the moment trying to entice farmers to relocate from the land of the big white cloud to the Apple Isle.
The Circular Head Council is distributing a booklet at this week's New Zealand National Agricultural Field Days, giving a regional and economic profile of the northern Tasmanian region.
The council's strategic projects officer, Lisa Nelson, says compared to New Zealand, prime dairy land in Tasmania is almost half the price and any farmers who make the move will have no problem settling in.
"Tasmania's very similar to New Zealand in a lot of respects," she said.
