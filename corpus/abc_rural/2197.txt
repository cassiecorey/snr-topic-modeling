Grain handler posts record profit
South Australian-based grain handler ABB Grain Limited has post a record $66.7 million profit for 2005-2006.
The results are up 60 per cent, largely due to expanded marketing, storage and handling operations.
But there are concerns about the ongoing drought.
Managing director Michael Iwaniw says to cut costs, the company is reducing staff and operations, and suspending executive salary increases.
"We've closed 40 receival sites, we have reduced our casual labour significantly and we are looking at transferring our permanent labour force across the states so we'll utilise labour more efficiently, looking at reducing operating hours," he said.
"You'd expect a fall in profits and we've alluded to that.
