Red wine fails to meet Chinese standards
China has rejected more than 10,000 bottles of Australian red wine because it contains too much of the preservative sulphur dioxide.
The 840 cartons were rejected by Chinese customs authorities at the port of Shenzhen.
It is understood the wine was bottled in 2003 by a winemaker from New South Wales, whose name is being kept under wraps.
Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation chief executive Sam Tolley says the wine has been knocked back because it does not meet Chinese standards.
"So when the sulphur was added to the wine, the blend wasn't mixed thoroughly, so there's some parts of the wine that have this high sulphur content and the rest would have lower," he said.
