Drought forces revision of USDA wheat forecast
The US Agriculture Department (USDA) has made dramatic changes to its latest wheat forecast based largely on the unfolding Australian drought disaster.
The USDA knocked down its estimate of Australian wheat production by a whopping 8.5 metric tonnes to just 11 million tonnes in just one month and this has sharply changed US numbers.
Chairman of USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board Gerald Bange blames Australia's drought and extreme heat.
"The Australians will not be in the export market the way they would have been otherwise," he said.
"As a result of that, we have increased our export forecast today.
"We went up 25 million bushels from our previous forecast."
