Aussies lose Iraqi wheat trade
A delegation from AWB has travelled to Iraq in an attempt to rebuild the company's damaged reputation.
Figures out of the US suggest it now has 72 per cent of the wheat trade with Iraq, once Australia's biggest grain export destination.
AWB chairman Brendan Stewart says the US is a major competitor and he cannot set a deadline on winning new wheat contracts.
He says the meeting was requested by Iraqi authorities.
"This is an initial re-engagement meeting and is really to talk about process, not to talk about tenders and prices and those sorts of things," he said.
Meanwhile, a group of grain growers - mainly from Western Australia - is investigating possible legal action against AWB.
The WA Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is researching whether there are irregularities with AWB's incentive scheme.
The group of growers is concerned that $200 million could have been deducted from income that should have gone to growers.
The PGA's Leon Bradley says a legal firm has agreed to act on its behalf to investigate concerns.
"Well our first concern is that the benchmark itself is internally determined by the AWB and we're concerned about its integrity," he said.
"Secondly, with some of the evidence emerging at the Cole commission, we believe some of the prices that have been used to calculate their performance have been inflated."
AWB believes the PGA has misunderstood AWB's incentive scheme.
The company says will try to resolve the issue with the PGA before it embarks on legal action.
