Rain prospects improve
There is an improved prospect of rain for some parts of Australia over summer.
The National Climate Centre's latest climate outlook still predicts some of the country's most drought affected land will stay drier than normal over the next three months.
South-east Queensland and much of New South Wales will only have a 30 to 40 per cent chance of receiving above average rainfall.
And a hot summer is still forecast for most of eastern Australia, with the confirmation of the El Nino weather pattern.
But meteorologist Grant Beard says it is not all bad news, as some areas could get above average rainfall.
"It's more encouraging for northern and north-west Queensland," he said.
"There's an increased likelihood of wetter than average conditions there and it's not quite as discouraging as it was in the south-east of the country as well where the probabilities have risen from around about 40 per cent or a bit lower last outlook.
