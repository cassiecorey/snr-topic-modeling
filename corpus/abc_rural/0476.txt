Little in budget to encourage exploration, says mining group
The WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy says there is little in the Budget to encourage exploration in the resources sector.
The industry wants a flow-through shares scheme to boost exploration but did not have any joy last night.
Chamber director David Parker says more needs to be done there as well.
"This is something which industry has been arguing for a number of years," he said.
"We see exploration as very much the future of the resources industry.
"We are tending to rest on our laurels in terms of the future sustainability of the industry.
"I think if you look at the medium to long term outlook for renewing Australia's resources inventory we really are at cross roads.
