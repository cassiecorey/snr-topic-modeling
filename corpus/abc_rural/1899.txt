Industry, Govt urged to take mining exploration seriously
The mining industry says Australia is sending billions of dollars overseas because of a lack of incentives for local exploration.
Australian companies are at the forefront of an exploration boom in regions like Africa and South America, which offer attractive tax and cost incentives.
While mineral exploration worldwide has hit a record high of more than $US5 billion annually, Australia's share has halved in 10 years.
Justin Walawski from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies says it is time for industry and the Government to take the issue seriously.
