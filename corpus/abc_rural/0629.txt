Grain boosts ABB profits
South Australian agriculture company ABB grain has announced a 24 per cent rise in after tax, half-year profit.
The result for the two-year old corporation is largely attributed to a 35 per cent increase in grain receivals for the last season.
Grain market analyst, Malcolm Bartholemaeus, says that despite the malting section of the company struggling, it is still a strong result.
