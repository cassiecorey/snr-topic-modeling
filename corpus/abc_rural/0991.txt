Farm quarantined after BJD find
Just when many farmers in Western Australia thought the season could not get any worse, there has been confirmation of a fatal wasting disease in a cattle herd.
The Department of Agriculture and Food says a farm near Albany in the state's Great Southern, has been placed under quarantine, in a bid to prevent further spread of bovine Johne's disease (BJD).
The state's BJD-free status is now under threat.
Chief vet Dr Peter Buckman says an extensive testing process is now under way to try to trace beef cattle which have been sold off the farm in the past decade.
