Vic growers plan to fight markets relocation
Victorian fruitgrowers and horticultural exporters are planning to fight plans to relocate one of Australia's biggest wholesale markets.
The State Government wants to relocate the markets from inner city Melbourne to the outer northern suburbs, because it believes the existing site is too small.
But spokesman for the growers and market users, Geoff Thomas, says the new site will be a waste of $300 million in taxpayer funding, because no one will use it.
