Rally to highlight wool growers' frustrations
There is growing frustration about the options being provided to wool growers during the current woolpoll, with a crisis rally to be held next week in the central west of New South Wales.
Producers can have a say on the level of wool tax they pay, from zero to 3 per cent.
But Wellington producer Peter Barton says they must also be able to influence how the tax take is used.
