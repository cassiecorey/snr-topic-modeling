Beattie's reaction to frozen bananas 'outrageous'
Queensland Premier Peter Beattie has been accused of using concern over processed banana imports to boost his state election campaign.
Voters go to the polls on Saturday.
Mr Beattie says the Federal Government has broken its promise not to allow banana imports while Queensland growers recover from Cyclone Larry.
Eleven tonnes of cooked frozen banana pulp from Vietnam has been brought in for use by food manufacturers.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the local industry is not threatened in any way.
"It's outrageous that the Premier would seize on this and create a quarantine scare when none exists and cause worry for many banana growers, who may not know the true situation," he said.
