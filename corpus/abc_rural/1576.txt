China buys into future uranium mine
Just months after signing an export agreement with the Australian Government, China has bought into a future uranium mine in South Australia.
The Crocker-Well uranium field, 100 kilometres west of Broken Hill, will be developed and operated by the state-owned Sinosteel Corporation, and Australian exploration company PepinNini.
Sinosteel will pump $30 million into the project, which could mean the development of a fifth uranium mine in South Australia.
The joint venture is yet to be approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board, but PepinNini director Rebecca Holland-Kennedy says the company expects to get the go ahead.
