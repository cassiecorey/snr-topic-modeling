AWB lawyer quizzed about secret documents
An AWB in house lawyer has been reduced to tears at the resumption of public hearings of the Cole inquiry in Sydney.
Witness Jessica Lyons has been quizzed about two previously secret documents released to the inquiry by the Federal Court.
The documents from January 2003 show exchanges between Blake Dawson and Waldren's solicitor Hazel Brassington and Ms Lyons.
They discuss changes to the freight arrangements of two wheat contracts for the Iraqi Grains Board.
When senior counsel assisting John Agius asked Ms Lyons who authorised the change, she told the inquiry she believed it was AWB marketing executive Chris Whitwell.
Earlier, Mr Whitwell and former AWB employee Michael Long made an application to keep secret, names of two legal advice documents, claiming their publication would prejudice them and affect the conduct of any possible future jury trial.
Commissioner Cole rejected their application.
Meanwhile AWB has increased estimated pool returns for this season's wheat crop.
Growers can expected to receive between four and $10 a tonne more.
Feed grain has seen the biggest lift, due to strong local demand.
