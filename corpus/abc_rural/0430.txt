Snowy Hydro inquiry won't delay sale
The New South Wales Government says plans to privatise Snowy Hydro will not be delayed by a parliamentary inquiry into the sale.
A New South Wales Upper House committee made up of Government, Opposition and cross bench members will investigate concerns about the privatisation.
The inquiry is due to report back in late October, although the State Government says the sale will proceed by the middle of the year.
Opposition natural resources spokesman Adrian Piccoli denies it is too late to make a difference.
