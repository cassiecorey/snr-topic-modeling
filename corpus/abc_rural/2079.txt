AWI meeting discusses challenges
The major challenges facing the wool industry are being debated today at the annual general meeting of peak body, Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
Around 200 wool growers have converged on the RSL club in Armidale, in the heart of north-western New South Wales, to hear about the report card on Australian Wool Innovation for the past year.
On the agenda, the progress of the proposed merger with Australian Wool Services despite an estimated $27 million UK super debt, also the court case with animal rights group PETA and the last minute jockeying, hand shaking and electioneering by the new candidates is well under way.
The results of the elections to finalise the new AWI board will be announced later on today.
