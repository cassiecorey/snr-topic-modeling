Plan aims to tackle climate change impact on agriculture
The federal, state and territory governments have unveiled a national action plan to tackle the affects of climate change on agriculture.
It is designed to help farmers adapt to a changing climate, mitigate and prevent the impact of change, provide better research and development and increase awareness.
While there is no funding or specific projects yet, Ben Fargher from the National Farmers Federation says it is a significant step.
