Emergency services failed to tackle fire: report
An investigation into the 2003 Canberra bushfires has highlighted a failure to attack fires early and a failure to warn the public of impending danger.
Four people were killed and 500 homes destroyed in the blaze, which started in the mountains, west of Canberra.
The coronial report makes more than 70 recommendations, but there is concern over how the ACT Government will respond.
ACT coroner Maria Doogan has handed down 15 findings on the cause of the fire.
Among them, the ACT Emergency Services Bureau had failed to aggressively attack the fires.
They withdrew crews on the night they started, fire trails were overgrown, and there were heavy fuel loads.
She also found that in the face of drought and extreme fire conditions, the bureau had inadequate maps, planning, bulldozers and other support for fire crews.
The coroner has acknowledged that the ACT Government had already given more statutory power to emergency services, but had since returned the fire control to answer to bureaucrats with no special emergency management knowledge.
