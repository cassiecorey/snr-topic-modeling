Frost wipes out crops in WA
Horticulturalists in Western Australia are suffering an unseasonal frost, wiping out a number of fruit and vegetable producers in the state's south east.
The estimated $4 million worth of damage will cause shortages and price rises.
Manjimup avocado producer Tony Fontiani says it is his second successive year of seasonal setbacks.
"We've lost about approximately 90 per cent of our fruit we had 12,000 trays of avocados on the trees and I think we'll be lucky if we pick a thousand to 1,500 trays," he said.
"It just means that we will have to tighten our belts and spend less and struggle through for another year but we're only just getting in to the situation where we're producing a quantity of avocados, this was going to be our big year."
And frost could cut Australia's navel orange crop this season by 20 per cent, according to preliminary forecasts.
