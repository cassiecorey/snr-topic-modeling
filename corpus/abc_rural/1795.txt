Firefighters battle blazes in Tas, Vic
Tasmanian fire services say they have brought under control all 12 bushfires around the state.
The worst blazes are in the state's south, although fires have also been reported on Flinders Island and Cape Barren Island.
There have been no reports of serious property damage but with temperatures pushing 30 degrees, the fire service warns the situation could worsen.
In Victoria, a bushfire burning south of Mt Baw Baw in Gippsland has spread to 300 hectares, driven by strong northerly winds.
Fifty firefighters are working on the blaze and bulldozers are cutting containment lines to stop its spread.
