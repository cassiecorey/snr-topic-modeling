Mining company confident of copper deposit discovery
The directors of mining company, CuDeco, remain confident they have found one of Australia's biggest deposits of copper near Cloncurry in north-west Queensland.
The company, which until yesterday was known as Australian Mining Investments, hit the headlines after its share price jumped from 29 cents to a high of $10 in seven weeks.
Trading in shares are suspended pending an investigation by the Australian Stock Exchange.
Directors met to reassure more than 30 shareholders in Cloncurry yesterday about the accuracy of the company's exploration results.
CuDeco chairman Wayne McCrae thinks they are sitting on something big.
"We'll put a resource out of 59 million tonnes at 2 per cent and all the indications are [that] it just seems to be getting bigger," he said.
