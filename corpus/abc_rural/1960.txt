Scientists want extra funding for CO2 storage projects
Australian scientists are calling on the Federal Government to double its funding for projects which store carbon dioxide underground.
The federal and state governments have announced a $2 billion low emission technology fund to help reduce emissions from coal, oil and gas mining.
Peter Cook from the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies is helping to design Australia's first project to store carbon dioxide in Victoria's Otway Basin.
He says the funding is not enough.
"Almost half of Australia's total emissions come from what we call stationary sources, in other words from power stations," he said.
