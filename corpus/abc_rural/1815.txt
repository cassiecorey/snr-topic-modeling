Qld Govt to pay farmers to destroy smut infested cane
The Queensland Government will pay cane farmers $2,000 a hectare to plough out and remove sugar cane crops infested by smut.
The long awaited plan of attack comes months after the fungal disease was first discovered near Childers in the state's south-east.
Since smut was found in June, surveillance has uncovered it on more than 60 properties, totalling 380 hectares in the Isis and Bundaberg region.
Isis Canegrowers chairman Joe Russo says destruction measures will help contain the disease to south-east Queensland.
"I see no point in leaving smut infested blocks out there," he said.
"We've now identified smut in some of those blocks of ratoon that have been harvested for the 2006 season.
"So it does go to show that we cannot leave it there and let the wind just blow it around.
