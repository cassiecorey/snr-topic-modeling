Mixed predictions for pulp mill
Shareholders of Tasmanian forestry giant, Gunns Limited, have been advised that the company's plans to build a pulp mill are risky and they should sell their shares.
The Commonwealth Bank's shares and stockbroking arm, CommSec, predicts Gunns' planned $1.4 billion pulp mill will never be cost-effective.
But industry analyst, Robert Eastment, says he has checked the facts in the report, and does not believe the negativity is warranted.
"It's just another report. There are some good ones, there are some bad ones," he said.
