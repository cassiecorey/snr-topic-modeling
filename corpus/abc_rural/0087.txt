Bio-gas plant to put cow manure to good use
A feedlot and abattoir in southern New South Wales is planning to generate electricity from cow manure.
Rockdale Beef at Yanco is developing a bio-gas plant, to make better use of 120,000 tonnes of manure produced at the feedlot every year.
General Manager Paul Troja says the $12 million plant will be one of the first of its kind in the country.
"The manure is collected and put into a digestor where the methane is extracted, the methane is cleaned then put through a gas turbine which generates electricity and hot water," he said.
"The electricity is used in the plant and the hot water in terms of our normal requirements in an abattoir operation.
