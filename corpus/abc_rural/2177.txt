Govt contributes to WA carbon trial
The Federal Government will contribute $60 million towards the world's biggest carbon capture and storage trial in Western Australia.
The money will go to the Gorgon natural gas project off the Pilbara coast, which is still waiting for the final go ahead.
If it proceeds, 125 million tonnes of excess carbon dioxide will be liquefied and buried 2.5 kilometres under the sea bed in saline aquifers .
Environment Minister Ian Campbell says it is imperative the project gets off the ground.
"The Gorgon project, being the biggest one of its type anywhere in the world, in fact bigger than all of the other projects in the rest of the world put together, will help us demonstrate that it can be done safely, that you can put in place a regulatory environment around it, put the risk management techniques around it," Senator Campbell said.
