Farmer confidence hits 4-year low: survey
Farmer confidence levels have slumped to a four-year low, according to the latest quarterly survey by Rabobank.
A lack of winter rain has caused farmers in most states to be more pessimistic about their outlook, with the biggest fall in confidence in Western Australia, closely followed by Victoria and South Australia.
Peter Knobblanche says cereal croppers and dairy farmers are the most concerned, followed by beef, sheep, wool and lamb producers.
"It was last this bad in 2002 when we had the big drought then so we're following suit I guess into the dry season again," he said.
