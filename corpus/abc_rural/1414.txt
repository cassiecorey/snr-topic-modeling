Court rejects Gunns claim against activists
An attempt by Tasmanian timber company Gunns Limited to seek damages from 20 environmentalists has been struck out in the Victorian Supreme Court.
Gunns was seeking almost $7 million from the activists.
It was claiming the activists had damaged profits and interfered with contracts by campaigning against the company's logging activities.
