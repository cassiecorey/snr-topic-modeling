Snow falls surprise NSW residents
An unseasonal cold snap sweeping through Victoria and Tasmania has taken parts of New South Wales by surprise.
After falling for most of yesterday, snow is still lying on the ground across the Monaro and southern tablelands.
There are also reports of snow falling at Armidale and Walcha in the state's north today.
Robert Taylor from Cooma says they can get snow at any time of the year.
"Not often but it does happen," he said.
"My father has seen snow on this place every month of the year throughout his lifetime, not all in one year, but during his lifetime he's seen it.
