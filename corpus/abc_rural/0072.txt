UN outlines farming's threat to water
A new United Nations report says farming is the biggest threat to the world's freshwater supply.
The report has been unveiled at a World Water Forum in Mexico, and recommends an end to subsidies on pesticides and fertilisers, and realistic water pricing.
But the forum has been told Australian farmers are world leaders, for using market forces to stop water wastage and pollution.
Mike Young from CSIRO Land and Water is at the forum and says Australia is recognised as a pioneer in tackling dwindling river flows, increasing contamination and pollution and damage to fisheries.
"I think we are very much at world's best practice in terms of innovations," Mr Young said.
"All of the discussions I have been involved in, people have been amazed at the approaches that Australia is taking in introducing tradeable water rights, actually moving very quickly to full cost recovery and often being there.
