Aust wine exports up 8pc
The volume of Australian wine exports has reached a record 749 million litres this year, up 8 per cent.
In the latest wine export approval report, the value of wine has increased slightly by 0.2 per cent, which is the first positive result in months.
Lawrie Stanford from the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation says demand ahead of Christmas from the UK, China and Europe has led to increased volumes.
"Traditionally the Australian wine industry ships a lot of wine overseas to meet the Christmas needs and also wine has matured over the last season around this time," he said.
"So normally our peak season is around at the moment but we've had a couple of quiet months and November is a a great catch up for us."
