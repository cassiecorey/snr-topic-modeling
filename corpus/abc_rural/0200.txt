Rural doctors want funding for more psychologists
Rural doctors say new funding for mental health services must take into account the lack of psychologists in regional Australia.
The Federal Government will spend $1.8 billion increasing psychology services and introducing new programs for young people to cope with depression.
Dr Ross Maxwell, president of the Rural Doctors Association, believes a plan to employ mental health nurses in medical clinics is a good approach for country areas.
"I think it has the potential, if well managed and well delivered, to make a difference," he said.
"I think the initiatives around employing mental health nurses in psychiatrists and general practice rooms, I think that is a very interesting and innovative way forward.
