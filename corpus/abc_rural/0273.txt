Nurseries to encourage kids to garden
The nursery industry is setting out to re-educate Australians about how to garden.
Market research has found gardening is losing market share from changing lifestyles, bigger houses, smaller gardens and a loss of skills.
The industry is fighting back and will soon launch a KidsGrow program, where local nurseries can work with schools to encourage children to garden.
Jenny Lambert, from the Nursery and Garden Industry Association, says gardening has social, educational and environmental benefits.
"The industry is concerned that the strength of the communities knowledge about gardening has dropped over the years and we're worried about where the next generation of gardeners is coming from," she said.
