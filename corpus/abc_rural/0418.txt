Wool pool to help Tas growers
In a departure from the traditional auction system, wool growers in Tasmania will be able to sell their fibre through a new wool pool.
Agribusiness Roberts Limited has launched Wool Link to market Tasmanian grown and branded wool direct to the fashion houses of Japan and the US.
Ten thousand bales will be sold in the first year, and the company says growers will be paid more than they have received on average in the auction rooms.
Marketing manager Eric Hutchinson admits there is bound to be scepticism.
"And for some it's going to be a leap of faith in what we can deliver, there's no doubt about that," he said.
