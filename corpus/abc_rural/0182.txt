Lessons learnt from mad cow epidemic
The discovery of mad cow disease has taught scientists how to better manage disease and improved how farmers and industry respond to new virus outbreaks.
It has 10 years since the link was discovered between mad cow disease in cattle and CJD in humans, with billions of dollars spent in control and research ever since.
Professor Colin Masters from the University of Melbourne says science has learnt many lessons from the mad cow epidemic.
"We've learnt a lot about risk minimisation and disease management," he said.
"If we've learnt anything at all we should have learnt that it's not a good thing to feed one species back to itself.
"In Europe it's been virtually outlawed, the situation in North America is different, they're watching very carefully what's happening in Europe and they're taking what appears to them to be appropriate measures at this time."
