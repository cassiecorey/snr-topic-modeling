Smut-infected cane to be destroyed
More sugar cane smut has been found on a south-eastern Queensland cane farm.
Authorities have confirmed that up to three hectares of smut-infected cane has been found on the already quarantined property near Childers.
With the industry biosecurity plan in full swing, decisions on how to destroy affected cane and whether local sugar mills will be allowed to crush have yet to be made.
Joe Russo, who discovered the disease on his family farm last week, says it is a hot spot of infection and crops will have to be destroyed.
