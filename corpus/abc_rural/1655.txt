Cotton growers offered refund if crop ploughed
For the first time in history, cotton growers have been offered a full refund on their seed costs if they are forced to plough in their crop due to a lack of rain.
Cotton Seed Distributors has developed the drought package to entice farmers to plant over the coming months, knowing they can recoup their costs if the season does not improve.
Company spokesman Adam Kay says the industry needs help.
"One of the things we could do was assist those growers that are wanting to have a little bit of a punt on things this season, putting some cotton in where they haven't got enough water at this stage or maybe when the price isn't that good," he said.
