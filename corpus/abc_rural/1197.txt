Chlorine used to eradicate exotic marine pest
An exotic marine pest has been eradicated, once again, from boats moored off Darwin Harbour.
The black striped mussel was found on three illegal fishing boats, apprehended in Australian waters.
Peter Zeroni, from the Northern Territory Fisheries Department, says chlorine was used to kill the mussels, but monitoring will continue.
"The vessels were treated in open water by a contractor with AFMA," he said.
"The chlorine we used to treat the vessels obviously affected the mussels. The chlorine will have gone into the woodwork and is likely to kill anything else that's in there.
"So we are pretty confident those boats are safe now. However as a precautionary measure, they will be re-dived every month, any vessels of hulls that are moored in the harbour will be re-dived on an ongoing basis.
