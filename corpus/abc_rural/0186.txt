Minister confident forest scheme will hold up to scrutiny
Federal Forestry Minister Eric Abetz is confident that Australia's Forest Standard will be upheld after a UK Government review.
The UK has placed a number of global forest certification schemes on probation while it reviews guarantees that the wood is sustainably and legally harvested.
Senator Abetz is rejecting suggestions that Australian forest products have been banned and is confident that the Australian Forest Standard will hold up to international scrutiny.
"We as a government can rely on robust, peer reviewed, scientific evidence and we will be putting the facts fairly and squarely before these governments," he said.
