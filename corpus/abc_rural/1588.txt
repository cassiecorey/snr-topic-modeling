Desalination plan prompts environmental concerns
Marine biologists have concerns about a plan by mining company BHP Billiton to build a water desalination plant near Whyalla on the Spencer Gulf in South Australia.
The plant would turn seawater into around 120 megalitres of fresh water a day.
But Marine Science Centre spokesman Toby Bolton at Port Lincoln says it could have a major impact on the marine environment.
"This proposal is to pump 320 megalitres of water a day from the northern Spencer Gulf and return about 200 megalitres of water to the gulf," he said.
