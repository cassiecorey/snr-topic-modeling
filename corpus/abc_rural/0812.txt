No AWB bid for Indian wheat contract
Eight international companies are competing for the latest $2.2 million tonne tender of wheat to India, but Australia's AWB is not amongst them.
The wheat exporter is working through another two deals to India worth a million tonnes.
Canada and Europe are expected to be the main suppliers for the new tender.
