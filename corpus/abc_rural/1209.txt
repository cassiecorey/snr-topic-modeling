More innovation needed to overcome wine glut: expert
The marketing sector has been forced to use its imagination to try to shift some of the billion litres of wine in storage across Australia.
One of the latest ideas is a six pack of cleanskin wines in brightly coloured bottles, which have stoppers, so they can be reused as water bottles.
Professor of wine marketing Larry Lockshin, from the University of South Australia, says there needs to be more innovation.
"Right now when you say to somebody 'wine', we think 750 millilitres in a glass bottle with a stopper of some sort, in Australia it might have a screw cap, other places might have a cork or a synthetic," he said.
"But that's a very traditional package, it's been around for hundreds of years, so we haven't been all that creative.
"Look at how you buy milk, how you buy fruit juice, how you buy even tomato paste in the stores. We used to buy it in cans, now you can buy it in tubes like toothpaste.
