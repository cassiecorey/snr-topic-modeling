Decision reserved on AWB 'apology' document
A Federal Court Judge has reserved his decision on whether to make AWB's so-called apology document public.
In hearings yesterday AWB argued the apology was drafted as part of the company's legal preparations for the Cole Inquiry.
Appearing as a witness for AWB, former managing director Andrew Lindberg told the court fellow board member Peter Polson had recommended a US public relations consultant to help draft the apology, given his experience with crisis management.
Mr Polson resigned as acting chief executive of the company last Friday.
But counsel for the Commonwealth said the main purpose for the draft apology was to influence public opinion and help AWB's public relations strategy, by submitting the document to the Inquiry.
Justice Young has reserved his decision for a date to be set.
