WA exercise to test response to foot and mouth outbreak
An operation dubbed "Exercise Wild West" starts today in Western Australia to test the ability of authorities to fight a foot and mouth disease outbreak.
The simulated exercise will run until Friday, and involves 180 people from the Department of Agriculture and Food and other agencies.
Director of Animal Biosecurity Ashley Mercy says an outbreak in Australia similar to the 2001 United Kingdom outbreak would cost the Australian economy about $15 billion.
