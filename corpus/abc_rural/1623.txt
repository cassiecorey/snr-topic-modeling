Dry weather impacts on store sheep sales
The number of spring sales of store sheep in Western Australia has halved due to the dry season.
While the number of sheep being sold for the meat trade has soared in recent months, the amount of sheep being offered to other graziers has dropped off.
In the next 10 days just 28,000 store sheep will be on offer in WA, compared to nearly 170,000 for the same period last year.
Recent rain has boosted some regions, but Ian White from Elders says there is still a lack of both store sheep and buyers.
"Some sheep that look like being sold a month ago, I think the rain's certainly bought a lot of farmers a bit of breathing space," he said.
