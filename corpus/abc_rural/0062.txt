Wheat survey aims to find profitable secrets
A survey of wheat growers in Victoria's Wimmera is under way, to try to determine what makes a profitable farmer.
Despite a good harvest this year, growers were hit hard when grain prices plummeted by up to $30 a tonne.
Researchers are hoping to find out what factors enabled some farmers to make a profit, while others had to sell their crops below the cost of production.
John Williams, from the University of Melbourne, says the results will be compared with similar data from the United States.
"One of the things that I've found over the last ten years is that growers don't have a good grasp of their cost of production," he said.
