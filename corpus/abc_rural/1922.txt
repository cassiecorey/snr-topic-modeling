Bananas not to blame for inflation rise: wholesaler
The Queensland fruit and vegetable industry says it is ridiculous to blame inflation on the price of bananas.
The latest consumer price figure rose 0.9 per cent in the three months to September, with the federal Treasurer singling out banana prices as a factor.
And on the basis of the CPI, the Reserve Bank is expected to increase interest rates next month.
But Brisbane wholesaler Tony Joseph says while banana prices have gone through the roof, there has only been 10 per cent of normal supplies on the market .
"Bananas have been as high as 130, $140 a case, which is way above their normal price, most probably around the mid-20s when we've got a full supply of bananas," he said.
