Overnight rain welcome but not drought-breaking
Victorian farmers say overnight rain has given dying crops a reprieve and delayed decisions to sell livestock.
More than 20 millimetres has fallen across many parts of the Wimmera Mallee, a region that has had no significant rain since July, and where reservoirs are at criticially low levels.
Farmers say this rain will not break the drought, but will keep their crops alive for another couple of weeks.
"A lot of the stubble crops I think will fire up a bit - they were nearly dead, pretty yellow, but the fallow was okay, it was just hanging on," he said.
"But mainly my stock, I can hang onto my stock.
"We can look forward I guess to two or three more weeks, then we're looking for quite a bit more rain in the springtime to finish the crops off.
"We've had 14, it'll turn it around pretty well for a couple of weeks. It was getting pretty desperate up until now.
