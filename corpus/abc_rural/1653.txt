Stations look to unmanned planes over traditional labour
Remote control aeroplanes that can monitor stock, fences and water levels are becoming cost competitive with farm labour.
That is the finding of an MLA sponsored project being carried out by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and the Kondinin Group.
The project is looking into technologies that can cut labour expenses on large cattle stations.
Les Zeller from the Queensland DPI says unmanned planes will make light work of everyday surveillance tasks.
