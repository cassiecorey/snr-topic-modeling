Historic cattle property sells for $27m
One of Australia's most historic cattle properties has been sold for a reported $27 million.
Goonoo Goonoo was established under an 1833 grant from King George IV to the Australian Agricultural Company.
The 5,400 hectare farm near Tamworth, in New South Wales, was owned by the Colonial Agricultural Fund, which was bought out by central Queensland cattleman Peter Hughes and partner Bill Scott earlier this year.
It has now been sold to the Macquarie Goodman Group.
Mr Hughes has also sold the Trevenna Downs aggregation near Goondiwindi and says the properties did not suit his focus on the northern cattle industry.
"It doesn't fit with the operation we are dealing with in north and central Queensland," he said.
"In a big pastoral situation I find the economy of scale is not there.
"They are wonderful family places, very good for families and private individuals.
"When you get into the bigger scale, you have got to employ whatever you have got to employ to make those big places run.
