Court decision looms over AWB documents case
Wheat exporter AWB will know this afternoon if the Federal Court will hear its case to keep 1,300 secret documents from the oil-for-food inquiry.
The company has claimed legal privilege over the material, saying it represents confidential advice and should not be seen by Commissioner Terence Cole.
AWB claims disclosure of over 1,300 documents will expose the company to irreparable harm, even though the Federal Government amended legislation last month giving Commissioner Cole the power to see the secret material.
AWB says the new law is unconstitutional and Commissioner Cole will be in contempt if he uses it.
The wheat exporter wants the Federal Court to impose a permanent injunction restraining the Commissioner from inspecting the documents.
Justice Neil Young will decide this afternoon if the court will intervene to hear the matter.
Meanwhile farmers in New South Wales have voted to continue their support for the single desk for wheat exports after a vigorous debate.
With the findings of the Cole inquiry into AWB still pending, farmers stated their support for the single desk while calling for better controls.
A motion was carried calling for improved corporate governance within AWB and better transparency between AWB and its export arm AWB International.
