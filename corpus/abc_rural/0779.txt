Retrenched Beaconsfield gold miners urged to head west
Retrenched miners from Tasmania's Beaconsfield gold mine are being lured to Western Australia with the promise of good jobs and a secure lifestyle.
Fifty-two workers were made redundant after the April rock fall that killed one miner and trapped two others.
Western Australian Mines Minister John Bowler says his government has set up a special migration service to assist miners wanting to relocate to the booming resources state.
"We've got heaps of jobs over here, wonderful lifestyle, great to raise your families," he said.
"We're just saying to those workers at Beaconsfield if you haven't got a job and you've got a young family and you want to start anew, Western Australia is a great place to be.
