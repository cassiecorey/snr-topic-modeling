Irrigators relieved at Snowy Hydro sale collapse
Irrigators say they are surprised and relieved at the collapse of the sale of the Snowy Hydro electricity scheme.
The Federal Government pulled out of the sale this morning, citing concern from backbenchers and growing public opposition.
The New South Wales and Victorian Governments have also backed down.
Laurie Arthur from the Rice Growers Association says he did not think there was any way to stop the sale.
He says irrigators were worried about their access to water once the scheme was privatised and most will be pleased with the about-turn.
"I'm sure probably 80 per cent of irrigators are delighted that Snowy Hydro will not be privatised," he said.
"I think some of our people think that governments don't do a particularly good job of running companies and so it's still a very complicated issue and I would predict that we haven't actually seen the last of it within the next 10 years would be surprised if it doesn't raise its head again."
Prime Minister John Howard says although irrigator licensing conditions were a factor in the Government's decision, it was public opinion that forced the change.
