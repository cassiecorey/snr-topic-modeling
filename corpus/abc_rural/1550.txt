Dry conditions prompt early fire work
Forestry companies in South Australia have started fire prevention work nearly a month early, due to the dry conditions.
Forestry SA, which manages around 130 hectares of softwood plantations and native forest, has begun work on firebreaks, cleared internal tracks and trained extra crew.
Spokesman Rick Underdown says the potential for bush fires is extremely high, especially in the native forests.
"We are particularly worried about that because low rainfall means that the soils are still relatively dry and the fuels in the native forests, that's the litter on the ground and the dead matter just above that, dries out at the same rate as the soils," he said.
