Healthier oil may lie in Canadian canola
Work is under way to try to develop a healthier oil for commercial cooking.
Canola oil is not suitable for baking, fried foods and margarines because it does not have a long shelf life.
The Victorian Department of Primary Industries is part of an attempt to breed a Canadian canola variety that is resistant to the disease blackleg, so it can be grown in Australia.
Breeder Laura Maher hopes the new oil will be put to the test next year.
