Falling wheat crop to blame for AWB share drop
A Western Australian business analyst says AWB's recent share price has been affected more by the falling wheat crop than its new managing director.
The wheat exporter announced yesterday that Orica's head of mining Gordon Davis will replace Andrew Lindberg next month.
Shares in AWB slowly dropped during this week's trade, but gained two cents this morning to hover around $3.74.
Ashley Kelly from Bell Potter Securities says at this time of year the market sharply watches announcements about the grain pool.
"The last update we had on the grain pool was back on the 31st of July, which wasn't very long ago and of course those estimates were lowered," Mr Kelley said.
"If you're a betting person, then you'd probably bet there's possibly another one to come.
