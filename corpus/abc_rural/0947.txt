Organic farmers eye overseas markets
The United States, Europe and South-East Asia are potential markets for Australian-grown organic products, according to a report launched last night.
The report by the Rural Industries and Development Corporation looks at the demographics of consumers, and what drives them to buy organic food.
Andre Leu, from the Organic Federation of Australia, says in the long-term, China will be a major market, although Australia will struggle to compete with its domestic production.
"The latest figures that we have from China show that their industry is worth $US8 billion, which makes them one of the largest organic markets in the world," he said.
