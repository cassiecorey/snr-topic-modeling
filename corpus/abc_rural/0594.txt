MacNeil resigns over wheat fight
A public fight over a grower levy for the Wheat Export Authority between the Grains Council and the federal Agriculture Minister has claimed a victim.
New South Wales board member Angus MacNeil has resigned from the council, after it attacked Peter McGauran for backflipping on a decision to reduce the levy.
"All the grains industry needs to be pushing in the same direction," he said.
"Unfortunately the grains council is alienating some of the key stakeholders and having difficulty working with them and I just don't think that's my style and I don't think it is going to give us the best outcome.
"I mean there was a fairly public tiff that the Grains Council had with minister McGauran last week on the ABC.
"That is the style of thing that has happened and it is the sort of style I don't appreciate and I don't think is going to achieve us very much."
