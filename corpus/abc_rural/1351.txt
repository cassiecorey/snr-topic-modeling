Leaf rust let loose on feral blackberries
The CSIRO is stepping up efforts to stop the spread of feral blackberries using strains of the fungus, leaf rust.
The scientific body wants farmers to test the fungus on blackberry infestations over the next three years.
Small-scale testing was done in 2004, and the Federal Government has now boosted funding to roll out the project across the country.
