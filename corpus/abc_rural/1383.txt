Spring forecast to be hot, dry
The National Climate Centre says Australia can expect hotter and drier conditions this spring.
The latest three-month outlook has a 60 per cent chance of higher-than-average temperatures across most of the tropics, a large part of south-eastern Australia and south-west West Australia.
There is also a higher risk of an El Nino weather pattern.
Senior meteorologist Grant Beard says higher temperatures in the Pacific and Indian Oceans also means there is less chance of average rainfall.
"Fairly large areas of north-east to northern parts of Australia stand an increased chance of having a poor start to their wet season," he said.
"There's a bit area of the Northern Territory and a fair bit of Queensland that has a less than 40 per cent chance of receiving their median rainfall from September to November.
