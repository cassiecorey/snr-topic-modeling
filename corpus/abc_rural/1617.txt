Dohne merinos to be sold over web
The Internet is helping graziers in remote rangeland areas buy sheep that can cope with harsh, dry conditions.
With the growing popularity of the dohne merino breed, producers are about to begin selling livestock over the web, with 5,000 lambs from Queensland listed for the first sale in November.
Graham Coddington from the eastern states Dohne Breeders Association says the web is particularly useful for farmers who are a long way from the major saleyards.
"See there's a lot of dohnes bred a long way from the markets right up in Queensland and western NSW," he said.
"That gives them competition for their product on their property before they (the sheep) leave there, without spending a cent on trucking them somewhere and stressing them all.
"Where they just go straight to where they're destined for, whether it's feedlot, meatworks or breeders."
Meanwhile woolbuyers from around the world will be able to bid for Australian fibre on the Internet.
Elders is set to move its global wool auction onto the web for the first time in November to allow more buyers, exporters and mills to compete.
