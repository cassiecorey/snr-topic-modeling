Wool market ends year on high note
The wool market has ended the year strongly, with the eastern market indicator up 14 cents to 839 cents a kilogram.
Following solid gains in the Sydney sales early in the week, prices in Melbourne jumped 16 per cent.
Merino fleece wools were in strong demand, with price rises across all micron types.
Buyers from China have dominated sales this year but a pick up in demand from other countries has been a major factor in lifting the market.
