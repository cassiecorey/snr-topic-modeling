Rain enables farmers to finish sowing crops
Welcome rain over the grain belt in Western Australia this week has many farmers back out in the paddock to finish sowing crops.
The Western Australian Farmers Federation has surveyed its members and president Trevor De Landgrafft says that for many, the season is a long way behind, after one of the driest May and June periods on record.
"Forty per cent of the respondents have less than half of their crop in the ground," he said.
"Half of those people don't have any crop in at all.
"Sixty per cent of respondents have got more than half their crop in and two thirds of that number somewhere between 80 and one 100 per cent.
"We're saying we think about half the crop that has been sown is out of the ground."
