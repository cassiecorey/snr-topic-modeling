Water use produce labels mooted
Products grown in the Murray Darling Basin under best-practice water use could be labelled as such, similar to the Heart Foundation's tick or the 'Australian Grown' labels.
It is just one of a number of ideas to be put on the table at the the Murray Darling Association's annual meeting at Barham next month.
General manager Ray Najar says it could help raise consumer awareness of what is produced in the basin.
