AWB finds more kickbacks documents
Thousands of documents previously withheld by AWB's inhouse lawyers have been discovered by the oil-for-food Inquiry.
The hearing into AWB's $290 million in kickbacks to the former Iraqi Government has reopened in Sydney.
Senior counsel assisting Commissioner Terence Cole, John Agius QC, opened proceedings by telling the inquiry that AWB had found yet more documents.
Mr Agius said 129 volumes had been located by AWB's internal lawyers, Rosemary Peevey and Jessica Lyons.
A further 69 volumes have been found in connection with Jill Gillingham, who has just taken the witness stand.
Ms Gillingham said she reported directly to Andrew Lindberg.
She negotiated contracts worth $750 million a year for storage, handling and movement of grain.
Ms Gillingham also told the inquiry she was the link between US public relations guru Peter Sandman and Mr Lindberg's so-called apology document.
