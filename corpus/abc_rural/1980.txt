Complaint delays animal ID system audit
There has been a six-week delay in an audit of Australia's new electronic animal identification system.
The audit was commissioned in July to investigate claims of inaccuracies and systemic errors in the system's database.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says an official complaint last month about the process has caused delays.
Meanwhile one of Australia's biggest cattle producers has been fined for failing to electronically ear-tag his cattle.
Despite pleading guilty, the central Queensland-based Laglan Pastoral Company has hit back at the prosecution, saying ear-tags were not available.
The company was charged with breaching Queensland's new national livestock identification laws by trucking cattle between company properties without the ear-tags, which are designed to trace animals from paddock to plate.
Spokesman Charles Lund believes the $800 fine and conviction is unfair
"The meatworks will tell you over 30 years we've never had a question come back from them and our cattlework and our paperwork's been always spot on and they couldn't find anything wrong with any of our paperwork or the traceability of our stock," he said.
"What annoys me the most, that we've helped the DPI, we've helped the police, we've caught quite a lot of stolen cattle and that, and we're all for cattle being correctly designated, but if you can't get a product to put in them in the ear, you can't put it in the ear."
