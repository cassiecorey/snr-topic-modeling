Nuclear power report won't help uranium industry in short term
Australia's uranium sector says yesterday's positive review into nuclear power will make little difference to the industry in the short term.
Although share prices in uranium explorers rose on the back of the Switkowski report, the Association of Mining and Exploration says Australia's uranium reserves are still under-utilised.
Spokesman Ian Loftus says the public tends to confuse nuclear energy with uranium mining.
"We have some of the world's great resources in terms of uranium in the ground and we have the ability here and now, subject to government approvals of course, to dig up that uranium and use it to provide fuel for clean electricity for other parts of the world," Mr Loftus said.
