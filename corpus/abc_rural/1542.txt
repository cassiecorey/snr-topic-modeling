Demand grows for environmentally friendly export meat
Pressure is growing for sheep farmers to demonstrate their green credentials, particularly to export markets.
New research in the lamb industry has found demand for environmentally friendly meat is higher overseas than locally.
Sheepmeat researcher with the Department of Primary Industries in Victoria, Nick Linden, says surveys found a growing number of shoppers want to know whether a farm is environmentally accredited.
"We certainly had a stronger response that there were more market opportunities at the moment today in the export market than there was in the domestic markets," he said.
