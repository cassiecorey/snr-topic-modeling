Farm dam management under scrutiny
Better regulation of farm dams in the upper areas of the Murray Darling Basin catchment area was brought to the attention of those attending the 11th national water conference in Sydney yesterday.
The Minister for the River Murray, Karlene Maywald, says while there is progress being made in providing the 500 gigalitres in environmental flows to the Living Murray project by 2009, she says the states now need to take the next step in the process.
She says all states need to work together to come up with co-ordinated approach to manage environmental and unregulated water flows and farm dams.
Ms Maywald also says the State Government has bought 11 gigalitres of water from irrigators willing to sell in recent time.
She is unable to disclose how much this has cost the Government.
