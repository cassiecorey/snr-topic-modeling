Senate inquiry may consider Timor labour
East Timor could join the list of potential Pacific nations to provide workers to Australia.
Tasmanian Senator Guy Barnett says if the need for labour is demonstrated, the inquiry will be broadened to include countries to Australia's north.
"The terms of reference includes the Pacific and the Pacific islands, and clearly having been in the Northern Territory there is obviously the view, that has been put to us, is that there should be consideration given to Timor and further north into Asia," he said.
