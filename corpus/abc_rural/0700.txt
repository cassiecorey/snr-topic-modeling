NSW Budget rural transport funding disappoints
Farmers in New South Wales say they are disappointed with a lack of money for rural rail and roads in the state Budget.
Posting a deficit of almost $700 million, the Government has increased spending for primary industries, natural resources and rural infrastructure.
Jock Laurie from the New South Wales Farmers Association says it was a wasted opportunity.
