US cattlemen unhappy with Japanese beef trade terms
The US beef industry is not impressed by Japan's agreement to re-open its market to US beef after Tokyo completes inspections of US plants in July.
Trade adviser for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Greg Doud, complains it has been two-and-a-half years and the US has traded no beef with Japan.
Now on the eve of a visit to the US by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Japan has agreed to resume imports, but keep out the vast majority of US beef with what Mr Doud says is an unscientific barrier to trade.
"We're not going to be happy until we're at an international guideline, and we're able to trade everything, at a minimum, under 30 months of age," he said.
Japan insists on a 20-month standard to combat mad cow disease.
The US cattlemen back trade sanctions against Japan, introduced by several US lawmakers, until Japan finally lifts its US beef ban.
The Cattle Council of Australia is cautiously welcoming the news.
Executive director David Innal says the sooner consumer confidence about the safety of beef returns, the better for all cattle producers.
"We welcome the US beef coming back into the market," he said.
