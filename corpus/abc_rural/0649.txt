Govt expected to abandon diesel fuel rebate changes
The Federal Government is expected to announce a backflip on proposed changes to its diesel fuel rebate later today.
Under the current system, fuel energy credits are refunded to farmers and other big diesel users through cash payments to bank accounts.
The Government had planned to add the refund to GST rebates, which industry said would create a cash-flow nightmare.
