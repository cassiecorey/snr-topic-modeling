Vaile confident of Iraq wheat deal
Trade Minister Mark Vaile says an important deal to sell wheat to Iraq could be completed as early as this week.
The Iraqi Grains Board told reporters overnight it had signed a contract to buy 500,000 tonnes of wheat at $US190 a tonne or around $US130 million in total.
But the consortium dealing with Iraq, Wheat Australia is not confirming details of the deal or that the Iraqi Grains Board has signed a contract.
Mr Vaile says conditions are still to be sorted through, but he believes the reported figures are close to the mark.
"I understand it is getting close, the negotiations are getting close to conclusion but there are still a number of issues left to be resolved," Mr Vaile said,
"I'm also aware that what is being negotiated is a contract for around 500,000 tonnes of Australian wheat but not being involved at the centre of negotiations I can't confirm yet that that has been concluded."
Grains market analyst Lloyd George says if the Iraq contract goes ahead, it will be a big increase on the tonnage originally proposed.
But he says the price reportedly agreed to by Iraq, casts some doubt over the deal.
