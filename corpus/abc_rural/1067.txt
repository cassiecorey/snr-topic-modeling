Sheep producers urged to make 'bare bum' check
Sheep producers are being urged to check for signs of 'bare bum' sheep in their flocks, because new research shows the trait is more widespread than first thought.
The condition, where the breech of the animal is bare of wool and has less wrinkles than other merinos, was found on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula last year.
Australian Wool Innovation has been researching the trait to find out if it can be passed on, and whether it could be an alternative to mulesing.
Head of sheep productivity, Dr Troy Fischer, says the sheep may also produce better wool.
"Like with any trait there's variation involved, but [it] essentially demonstrates there is potential to select for improved wool quality plus the bare breech trait," he said.
