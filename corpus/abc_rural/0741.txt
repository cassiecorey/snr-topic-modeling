Wheat growers call for continued government assistance
With a new farm bill on the horizon in the United States, wheat growers there have joined calls for continued government assistance.
The wheat industry is concerned it has a shaky future, after figures showed wheat's portion of the national crop has fallen 10 per cent since the 1980s.
Grower organisations say the wheat industry is at a crossroads with little growth in exports, lower domestic consumption and loss of acres to other crops.
As well, there are concerns that wheat diseases are affecting farmers' profits and there is little research being done on new wheat varieties.
But while the the industry is keen to encourage new research, it has emphasised it must make economic sense for farmers to want to plant wheat in the first place.
According to the US department of agriculture, the wheat sector is facing long term challenges to its profitability, but asking for increased subsidies from government is not the answer.
The USDA says subsidies only artificially increase demand, rather than provide long term solutions.
The industry plans to hold a wheat summit later this year to try to work out how it can stay profitable and competitive in the international market.
The Indian Government has called for tenders to supply 2.2 million tonnes of wheat, after a lack of interest in a 3 million tonne deal last month.
Only 800,000 tonnes was allocated from the original wheat tender, with two thirds expected to be filled by AWB.
