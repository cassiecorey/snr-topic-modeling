Local councils 'starved of funds'
With a quarter of all local councils in New South Wales on the brink of financial collapse, farmers are calling for changes to Australia's system of government.
A symposium held in Sydney has heard experts on governance discuss how local councils are struggling to cope with new responsibilities and a lack of funds.
Former president of the NSW Farmers Association, Mal Peters, says state governments are ignoring rural communities and what is needed is a system of government that is closer to the people.
