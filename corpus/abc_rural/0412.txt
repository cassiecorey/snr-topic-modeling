Beef brand celebrates program benefits
The benefits of marketing food from paddock to plate are being marked by the 10th birthday of one of Australia's biggest beef brands.
Certified Australian Angus Beef began by supplying 12 steers for a Melbourne restaurant.
It now kills 2,000 head of cattle a week, with 80 per cent of the product exported.
Chief executive Michael Pointer says the program has added vale to the product and boosted demand for angus genetics.
"Very simply Certified Australian Angus Beef does not own an animal or a kilogram of beef," he said.
