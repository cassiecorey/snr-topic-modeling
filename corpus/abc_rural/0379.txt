Sterile fruit flies fail to satisfly partners
Sterile fruit flies have been touted as a way of controlling numbers of the pest insect but researchers say they are not proving to be satisfying mates.
Research has shown female fruit flies are attracted to the sterile males but they are not always satisfied and head off looking for other mates.
Dr Phil Taylor from Macquarie University says they are now trying to fix the problem, to stop them from causing major damage in horticultural regions.
"Wild flies don't seem to mind mating with them, however the sterile males have some issues with the amount of sperm they transfer and then the female's likely to re-mate," he said.
