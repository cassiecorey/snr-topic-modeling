Cloud juice headed for export market
Rainwater from Tasmania's King Island could soon become part of a Japanese tradition.
King Island Cloud Juice, as it is retailed, is currently being sought after to make the rice wine - sake.
Company director Duncan McFie says demand for the rainwater is increasing across the world and expansion is likely.
"I had this idea years ago that just as King Island Dairy has a tanker that drives around and picks up all the milk, I had this little cloud juice tanker in my head that drives around and picks up all the water," he said.
