Water policy 'ignores climate change'
A Senate committee says current government policies to regulate water have not considered the impact of climate change on future water availability.
The Rural Affairs Committee is investigating how Australia accounts for its water use and allocation.
Its interim report says changing rainfall and temperatures are not reflected in policy initiatives.
Committee chair, Greens Senator Rachel Siewert, says submissions to the inquiry show alarming trends.
"It appears to us that the impact of climate change on rainfall and subsequent water supplies has not been adequately accounted for," she said.
