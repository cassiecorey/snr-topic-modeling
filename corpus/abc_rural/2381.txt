Pork prices climb this Christmas
Demand for pork products has improved this Christmas, with prices lifting at retail level.
The industry has been struggling against major competition from imports during the past few years, not helped by a strong Australian dollar.
But New South Wales pork producer Neil Unger says prices of around 300 cents per kilogram are not keeping pace with increased production costs.
"Our cost of production is very, very close to $2.50," he said.
"We lose probably 20 cents in dockages because we don't like this one, that one is too skinny, that one is too fat.
