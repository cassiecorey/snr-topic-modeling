Telstra to consider objections when deciding on country pay phones
Telstra says it can not guarantee that some country communities will not lose their pay phones.
The company says it is permitted to remove some phones which are being underused and has agreement from the Federal Government.
But Jeff Booth from Telstra Countrywide says local objections will be considered.
"Where there are very, very low call rates, like one call per month or something similar, and where it's costing thousands of dollars to maintain a pay phone we'd probably use our discretion in that regard," he said.
