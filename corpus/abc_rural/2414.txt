New owner for Cowra abattoir
An abattoir in central western New South Wales, at the centre of a row over the Federal Government's workplace reforms, has a new owner.
The previous owner of the Cowra abattoir sacked 28 staff under the WorkChoices legislation and then offered to reinstate them at a lower rate.
The plant was handed over to adminstrators in August this year and then closed.
New owner Chris Cummins says major changes will have to be made to make the abattoir viable.
"Obviously we will have a reduction in staff," he said.
"The place failed before because it was over-manned.
"For a start there will be working an eight hour day, which wasn't the case before.
"All the chains will be wound back.
"We will have a pretty good product coming out of there, probably as good a product as anywhere on New South Wales will come out of there.
"It's a good plant and needs a little bit of money spending on it, it is in a great position.
