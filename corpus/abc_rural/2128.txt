Murray Irrigation slashes farm water supply
Irrigation water to hundreds of farms in southern New South Wales will be cut off next month as Murray Irrigation concentrates on maintaining supplies for stock and domestic use.
The company says irrigation will be restricted to areas close to the main channels, with consideration for contracted crops, feedlots and dairy farms.
Murray Irrigation chairman Stuart Ellis says the restrictions are necessary to prevent the whole system running dry by Christmas.
