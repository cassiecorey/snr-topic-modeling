Irrigators pass no confidence vote in NSW Govt
A vote of no confidence has been passed in the New South Wales Government over its handling of the sale of Snowy Hydro.
The move by Riverina irrigators comes as Finance Minister John Della Bosca meets with concerned farmers today at Deniliquin in the state's south.
Last night in Deniliquin, 300 people showed their displeasure at the New South Wales Government's handling of the sale of Snowy Hydro.
Mr Della Bosca was invited to the public meeting, organised by the Nationals but declined.
Today, in the same town, he will talk with irrigators in a closed meeting to hear their concerns about the sale of Snowy Hydro.
Organised by the Southern Riverina Irrigators Group, farmers say they are worried about what will happen to water entitlements if the Snowy scheme is privatised.
