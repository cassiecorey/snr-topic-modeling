AWI and PETA case will go to trial
A Federal Court judge has told lawyers for Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) and People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) that their case has chewed up too much time and a trial date will be set.
Justice Rares made the order today, two years after the AWI launched legal proceedings against PETA over its attack on mulesing and live exports.
He ordered all parties to appear before him on December 14 for what he described as a "substantive case management debate".
The judge said the time had come to bring some order to the case, in which AWI and 101 wool growers are suing PETA for its campaign aimed at getting international retailers to boycott Australian wool.
Justice Rares told lawyers they must present all evidence and full witness lists, and asked them to consider if they want a jury trial.
