Campdrafting Council seeking national endorsement
Campdrafting officials say they are hopeful a bid to have their sport recognised by the Australian Sports Commission will be successful.
The National Campdraft Council of Australia says while the sport was developed in Australia, it still needs to go through the process to become a national sporting organisation.
Council president Peter Cookson says that recognition is very important to the sport's funding and future.
"It's giving campdrafting credibility, to have things such as a code of conduct for animal welfare, member protection policy for the protection of our members and their committees and things like that," Mr Cookson said.
