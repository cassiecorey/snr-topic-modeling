Working together
Meanwhile, peak farm, water, environment and business organisations have agreed to work together to push for improvements in water security for farmers and urban users.
The National Water Commission (NWC) stakeholder group has agreed on priorities, including better water accounting and reporting, and addressing over-allocation of rivers.
Commission chairman Peter Corish says the group realises that bodies outside government can contribute to finding solutions to Australia's water problems.
