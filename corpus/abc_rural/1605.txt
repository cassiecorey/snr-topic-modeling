Young farmer of the year considers using prize money for stockfeed
Tasmania's new young farmer of the year says he might have to use the prize money to buy stockfeed unless it rains soon.
Heath Dobson has won $5,000 after proving himself Tasmania's best farmer under the age of 30.
However he says with Tasmania's continuing dry conditions he might be forced to put the money towards feeding cattle.
"We are going to need that bit of water from the sky I think shortly - it's been a very, very dry winter," he said.
