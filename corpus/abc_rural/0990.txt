Ship owners back moves for cheaper foreign workers
Ship owners say the latest move to replace Australian crew members with foreign workers is important for the competitiveness of our exports.
Crew members from the MV Stolt, currently docked in Hobart, are refusing to load the tanker in protest at plans to re-flag the vessel and replace them.
But Llew Russell from Shipping Australia Limited says it is cheaper to use foreign workers and the trend is likely to continue.
"We certainly support viable and competitive Australian flagged shipping but this should not be in terms of inhibiting our overseas competitiveness," he said.
