Shearers seek pay rise
Australia's shearers want a 4 per cent wage rise under their federal award.
The Shearers and Rural Workers Union has recommended a new minimum shearing rate of $218.31 per 100 sheep, an increase of around $9.00.
Shed hand rates would also rise.
General secretary John Morgan says members have been issued with common law agreements detailing the new rates and hopes wool growers will be prepared to sign them.
"It's not a great impost on the employers," he said.
"Some people have suggested that it's not enough, but at the same time we recognise wool growers aren't getting a fair deal in relation to their wool prices and we understand that.
"But they seem to forget that our people have got to travel large distances to get to their places of employment at great cost and we've got to be remunerated for our labour and our costs."
The industry is refusing to comment on the changes.
Meanwhile shearers across Australia are benefiting from a price war for their tools of the trade.
The price of combs and cutters have been cut by up to a third and the price of some new handpieces on the market are half that of established brands
Queensland shearing contractor Ian Bateman says he is happy about competition coming from China.
"I think it's a good thing, for the simple fact is, it's like anything else, if anybody gets a monopoly, they just seem to charge or do whatever they want to do and I reckon the third company into the business will definitely make the other companies brighten their foot work up," he said.
