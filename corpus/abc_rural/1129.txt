Drought officers angry over job loss
Community drought officers in Victoria's Wimmera region are at a loss to explain why their jobs have been cut.
Three of the four positions are no longer being funded by the Victorian Government, even though the drought is lingering across the region.
Former community drought officer in Yarriambiac Shire, Faye Smith says they met with the Department of Human Services and the State Drought Committee in Horsham yesterday but still do not know if they have a job.
"I was totally amazed," she said.
"To me it just seemed the strangest decision and now more than ever the community strengthening is needed.
"I cannot understand why the State Government would make the decision to wipe out the position when, as most people will tell you, that the situation now is probably as dire as it's ever been."
