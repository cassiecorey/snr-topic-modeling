Drought fails to deter banks from lending
Despite the drought, the banks are still keen to lend to farmers.
Queensland property valuer Kerry Herron says he believes the property market will come back due to the poor seasonal conditions.
He says the boom in recent years has increased landholders' equity and the banks are particularly willing to lend to buyers in the wetter northern regions.
"Cattle is still the flavour of the month and they're still offering very big terms," Mr Herron said.
"We have heard instances of up to 30 years interest only payments, certainly 10 and 15 years interest only is common.
