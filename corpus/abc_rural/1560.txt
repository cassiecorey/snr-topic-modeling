Grain traders question AWB pricing
The latest world crop forecast out of the US has local grain traders questioning why exporter AWB is not offering Australian wheat growers a lot more for their grain this season.
While there is little change to the North American crop outlook, the United States Department of Agriculture has downgraded its estimate of Australia's wheat crop to 19.5 million tonnes.
With supply tighter, and improving overseas grain prices, commodity trader Tony Smith says growers want to know why AWB is not offering higher national pool prices.
"We don't think the AWB's doing the wrong thing if they're being conservative, by any stretch of the imagination, but I think there's a lot of growers out there now thinking, well do I put it in the pool, I'm going to have some real cash flow problems this year, or do I sell for cash?" he said.
"They probably just need to be given a little bit more information than they normally would.
"If the AWB is being conservative by five or so bucks a tonne, then growers won't have a problem with that. But I think they just need to come out and say it."
