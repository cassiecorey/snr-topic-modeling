AWB plays down Cole inquiry to growers
Wheat exporter AWB has told Victorian grain growers it does not think the Cole inquiry into allegations of sanction-breaking kickbacks will present any problems for the company.
AWB's Brendan Stewart and Ian Donges have also told a grain growers' meeting in Melbourne that they believe the company will be in a position to rebuild after the inquiry.
The Victorian Farmers Federation grains group president, Ian Hastings, says he believes AWB has asked for similar meetings with farmer groups in other states.
"Brendan Stewart spoke about how the Cole inquiry was progressing and the fact that AWB still were clearly of the belief that they have not really done anything wrong," he said.
"They expect at the end of the Cole inquiry that [they] should be able to start and rebuild the company.
"They don't believe that they have actually broken any laws so I guess we all need to wait and see."
AWB spokesman Peter McBride says the company does not want to make any public statement pre-empting the outcome of the Cole inquiry.
