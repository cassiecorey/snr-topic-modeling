Ban on some rodeo events welcomed
Members of Rodeo Tasmania have welcomed bans on some rodeo events under the Tasmanian Government's proposed new animal cruelty laws.
New laws will ban the riding of sheep and poddy calves, while events must have a vet in attendance at all times.
Rodeo Tasmania's Annette Reed says the practices known as poddy calf riding and mutton busting are not common in the state.
"Very few rodeos run them, we're not at all upset at the fact that they have gone on the chopping block," she said.
