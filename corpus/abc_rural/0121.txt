Mixed response to wool contract system
A new contract selling system for superfine wool has had a mixed response from producers at the first of a series of nationwide meetings.
Under the plan, specific fibres would be supplied to customers through direct marketing, rather than the auction system.
Frank O'Connor, from the Australian Super Fine Wool Growers Association, says he is not confident the plan will get the support or the half million dollars it needs to get off the ground.
"Not at all, but I think that's the challenge ahead of us," Mr O'Connor said.
