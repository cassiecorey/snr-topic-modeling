Sheep genome mapping nearly complete
Science is one step closer to providing farmers with a complete genetic map of the sheep.
The 'virtual sheep genome' project has mapped 98 per cent of the sheep's genetic make-up.
That is enough to fast track the identification of the crucial genes for wool and meat quality, and even parasite resistance.
Dr Robert Forage, who is leading the joint Australian Wool Innovation/Meat and Livestock Australia project, says the sheep's genetic jigsaw is still not quite complete.
"It's put together using bits and pieces of information not only from the sheep but also from the cow and from the human as well," he said.
"So we don't have all the information we need from the sheep.
"We've put some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together but there are still holes in it - we think we know where everything fits but we don't have the complete sequence yet."
