Food safety standards need continual improvement, say scientists
The safety of the food that we eat is emerging as a crucial global trade issue, which can open or block access to markets.
Scientists at the Australian Food Safety Centre say the three main concerns are chemical residues, foreign items in prepared foods and pathogens such as bacteria and viruses.
Professor Tom Ross says pathogenic outbreaks occur at all levels of the food chain from the paddock to the plate and growers, and processors, need to continue to improve safety standards.
He says E. coli bug in the 1980s is an example of how potentially fatal contaminants continue to evolve.
"Twenty years ago that organism had never been seen before," he said.
