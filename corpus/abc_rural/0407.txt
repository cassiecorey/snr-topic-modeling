Turnbull hears river flow worries
The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for water, Malcolm Turnbull, has entered the debate over cross-border water flows in the Condamine Balonne river system.
Landholders in north-western New South Wales have long complained they are missing out because Queensland irrigators are allegedly extracting too much water north of the border.
Mr Turnbull met landholders yesterday and says while the Federal Government cannot force Queensland to change its water management policy, the problem must be addressed.
"There is no question in my mind that when the allocations of water were made in Queensland over the last 2O to 30 years, little or no regard was had to the downstream consequences in New South Wales," he said.
