Mission Australia highlights city-country divide
Divisions between the wealth and health of city and country dwellers are continuing to grow, according to a new report by welfare group Mission Australia.
The report says rural Australians are less likely to finish school, more likely to die from alcohol abuse or be affected by domestic violence, or suffer mental illness.
Anne Hampshire from Mission Australia says the concerns will be taken to Canberra next week along with a push for new programs.
"The report actually has three components, identify the problems which we have, identify some of the great initiatives which are happening on the ground so we make sure we can develop those further, but also we've suggested a whole suite of recommendations," she said.
