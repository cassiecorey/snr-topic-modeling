Expensive feed grain prices impact on graziers
Graziers buying grain to feed livestock this winter are feeling the pinch, with prices continuing to rise.
Dry conditions, higher petrol prices and strong global grain prices are all affecting the cost of feed grain.
Ron Storey from Australian Crop Forecasters says the success of grain-fed beef exports is also putting more demand on supply.
"Our demand here for grain domestically is being underpinned very, very solidly by a very strong feedlot cattle market, with grain-fed beef being in strong demand where BSE has given Australia pretty much by most of the market," he said.
