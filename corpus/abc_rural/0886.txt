Grain Council agenda baffles ex-president
Former Grains Council president Keith Perrett says the peak body is losing the confidence of growers and creating divisions in the industry.
Yesterday the council slammed a new survey calling for changes to the single desk for wheat exports, saying Single Vision Grains Australia had no authority to conduct it.
Mr Perrett headed the Grains Council between 2001 and 2005, but claims it is now failing to provide leadership.
He says he is baffled by its current agenda, which seems to be politically-driven.
"Certainly most growers that I speak to say 'what's going on here at the moment'," he said.
"It's a bit beyond me as to why they would be taking that line, you know the easy answer is to say 'well it's a bit of patch protection', I'm not sure what the outcomes are why they've come down the path they are.
"Certainly I'd be taking a different approach to the one that's being taken at the moment."
