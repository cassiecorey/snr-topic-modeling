Lamb feedlot shed open for business
One of eastern Australia's biggest lamb feedlot sheds has opened.
Based in Goondiwindi, in southern Queensland, it will house more than 3,500 sheep undercover.
Owner Kerry Corish says they originally expected to sell around 15,000 fat lambs a year but that number has significantly increased due to the drought
"I think at the moment the way it looks and the drought conditions, and because we've bought far more sheep than what we anticipated we would be able to buy, and that's simply driven by the drought and because (of) the large numbers available down south and the price drop in sheep, that we probably will go 20,000 plus, I would imagine," Mrs Corish said.
