Miniature greenhouse trial proves effective in retaining water
Broad acre farmers in the future could find themselves using hundreds of miniature greenhouses to save soil moisture and improve growth rates in their crops.
Bronwyn Laycock from the Cooperative Research Centre for Polymers says by stretching clear plastic over seed-beds, growers can create an entire paddock of tiny greenhouses.
She says so far trials have shown the technique is effective at retaining water in dry cropping districts.
"What we're trying to do is put it down over the seed as it is sown and it traps moisture, and traps the heat under the film like a greenhouse," she said.
"[It] gives it a better growing environment and also it means that as it is growing, we're capturing all the water that's transpiring, we're capturing the water in the soil so we get a moister soil environment.
