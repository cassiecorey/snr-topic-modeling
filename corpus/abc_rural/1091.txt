Internet helps farmers recruit backpackers
Video conference technology is helping job agencies tap into the backpacker market in Australia's far north-west.
One company has set up remote facilities in Broome, Western Australia, interviewing travelling workers over the Internet and then employing them to work in the farm sector.
One of the regions looking for workers is the east Kimberley, which looks set to have a bumper mango harvest.
Grower Lachlan Dobson doubts local labour will meet demand.
"There's guesstimates going around at the moment that Kununurra mango production might be up around 400,000 trays," he said.
