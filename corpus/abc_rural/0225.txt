Dairy farmers win milk price rise
Western Australian dairy farmers have won another price rise for their milk.
Fonterra lifted prices one and a half centres a litre last month but farmers said that was not enough.
The company will pay another half a centre per litre to milk suppliers to its WA-based subsidiary Peters and Brownes.
