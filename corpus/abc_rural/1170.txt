Online grain exchange nears launch
A consortium of agriculture and finance industry experts says it is almost ready to launch an Internet trading system for grain, oil seeds and legumes.
Wheat is the only commodity to be restricted to trade only in Australia.
Con Galtos from the Australian Grain Exchange is in negotiations with the major grain handling companies to talk up the benefits.
He says the system will give growers access to every price being offered in the international market place.
"The growers will know that the prices that they are offered for their grain are the prices that are offered for everybody else's grain, in other words it creates a level playing field," he said.
