Speed limit caps punish remote families: resident
Remote residents in the Northern Territory are outraged at Government plans to cap open speed limits.
By the end of next year, all travellers on the Stuart, Arnhem, Barkly and Victoria Highways will have to stick to a 130 kilometre an hour limit.
All other roads will have a 110 kilometre per hour cap.
Jo Coulthard from Orange Creek Station, south of Alice Springs, says the changes punish remote families.
"I don't think it's going to be upheld because how are they going to police it?" she said.
"We would have to take more time to do the travelling, which of course when you are working or living on a station you don't have a lot of time to be doing that sort of stuff.
"I think that's going to have a huge impact on us. Instead of just being an overnight trip... now it will have to be a couple of nights.
