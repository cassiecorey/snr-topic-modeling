Bega Cheese chalks up $10.5m profit
It is a record profit year, despite the drought, for New South Wales based dairy business Bega Cheese.
It posted a $10.5 million profit on a $280 million turnover.
The Bega Dairy Co-op employs more than 500 people, exports to 50 countries and produces Australia's top-selling domestic cheese brand.
Chairman Barry Irvin says all the Co-op profits were returned to the 100 farmer owners, to help see them through the worst drought in a century.
