Project to boost truckie numbers
The transport industry is holding out its arms to farmers needing employment during the drought.
A short course in truck driving is being offered at Wodonga in Victoria by the National Industrial Skills Training Centre to allow farmers to re-train as truckies.
Manager Sput Lowry says the project will help boost driver numbers.
