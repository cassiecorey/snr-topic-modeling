Farmers under pressure to compete in global trade
A new report backs farmer claims that they are under pressure to cut costs to remain competitive in global trade.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says while food exports have grown at 10 per cent a year, it is getting harder to make a profit in both export and domestic markets.
ABARE's Lisa Elliston says manufacturers and processors are also under pressure.
