Countries approve global macadamia association
Macadamia nut growers hope a new global body will ensure other countries help to pay for the industry's research and promotion.
As the world's leading producer of macadamias, Australian growers largely foot the bill, but a new global association has been approved by the 25 countries which grow the nut.
Queensland researcher Ian McConachie says it will provide better communication and even out the costs.
