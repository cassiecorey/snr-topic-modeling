Waste water scheme to benefit Tamworth farm
Tamworth council in north-west New South Wales has showcased one of the first environmental spin-offs of a planned waste water project.
It is a 140 hectare wedge of rehabilitated grassy box woodlands at the edge of what will become a farm which re-uses the city's water and effluent to grow crops.
Tamworth regional water augmentation manager Nigel Thompson says the project has environmental bonuses for the city.
