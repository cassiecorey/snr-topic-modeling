One in 12 year event behind weather pattern, says forecaster
A one in 12 year weather event is creating an unusually wet winter in the north of Australia but dry conditions in the south, according to a Queensland forecaster.
Dr Roger Stone says the sub-tropical ridge has dropped below the Australian continent to the south of Tasmania this year.
He says it is an important cyclical event which might explain this winter's conditions.
"It's the second most important factor after the El Nino SOI system," he said.
"As people may have noticed it's been way south, it gives us a lot of easterlies or south easterlies on to the Queensland coast , but also tends to bring in a bit more moisture than might normally be the case.
"It tends to get a bit too wet up around Cairns in this type of year, but it can help the situation in central Queensland.
