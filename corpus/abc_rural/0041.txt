Campaigners worried about approval of 'terminator technology'
Gene ethics campaigners are concerned a technology which stops seeds breeding naturally will be approved for commercial cropping in Australia.
Members of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, including Australia, banned "terminator technology" in 2000, when global protests forced biotech company Monsanto to state it would not commercialise the process.
But Bob Phelps from the Gene Ethics Network says the Federal Government is now reconsidering its stance which would threaten the natural biodiversity of seed crops.
"At a recent meeting in Granada in Spain, the Australian Government was arguing that the current ban should be modified," he said.
"The officials are saying that there is no ban on terminator in Australia at the moment and that any application that was made to the Australian regulators would be examined on a case by case basis."
But Dr Jim Peacock from the CSIRO's Plant Industries does not see the technology as a threat.
