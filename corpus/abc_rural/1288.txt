Australian judge makes mark on English show
An Australian cattle breeder has made his mark in England, after being invited to judge at the prestigious Great Yorkshire Show.
Rod Summers, who owns Maranga Stud at Evandale in Tasmania, was the mandatory independent judge of the belted galloway breed.
In true Australian style he managed to ruffle a few feathers before proving he knows his stuff about the British breed.
"A lady took me to task [about] why she was placed fourth instead of third after I swapped them, before I ordered the ribbons," he said.
"Anyway, then she explained to me how the beast I'd placed third she'd sold last year and the beast I'd placed fourth was the one she'd kept.
