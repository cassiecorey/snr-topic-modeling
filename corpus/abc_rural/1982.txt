AWI court action costing woolgrowers
The Federal Court has heard the Australian Wool Innovation's legal action against the animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), has cost woolgrowers $5 million.
The two-year-old case is a result of PETA's campaign against mulesing.
But at today's hearing in Sydney, Justice Rares has asked how woolgrowers can claim indirect economic losses, when AWI has $100 million in the bank.
The startling figures came out after PETA filed a strike-out motion against the woolgrowers' damages.
Rod Smith SC told Justice Rares AWI and its co-applicants had made a series of "forensic u-turns".
Mr Smith said he was intrigued to know how the 101 woolgrowers could prove they had suffered a loss of benefit in their levy when AWI had $100 million in its accounts last financial year.
Mr Smith added the 2 per cent levy was a Commonwealth statutory figure determined in November 2003 before the court action began.
Mr Bannon SC for AWI and the woolgrowers argued the strike-out motion was a shemozzle, saying if AWI had spent its legal fees in the PETA campaign on other things woolgrowers would be in a better position today.
Justice Rares ordered that AWI and the woolgrowers provide within seven days detailed particulars of the loss.
