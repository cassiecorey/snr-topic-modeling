Abattoir expected to confirm sackings withdrawn
The Cowra abattoir is today expected to confirm it is withdrawing termination notices for 29 workers.
The decision to sack the employees and offer lower paid contracts became a major test of the Federal Government's new industrial relations laws.
One of the affected workers, Rodney Veney, says he is thankful for the national attention on the Cowra abattoir because it helped save his job.
"Cowra's only a pin dot on the map and to get all this attention I think management might have been a bit shocked about it," he said.
"As I said, they've taken the termination notice back but if I didn't have the job at the abattoir I'm in a bit of a difficult position.
