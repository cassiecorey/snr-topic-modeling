S Korea lifts US beef ban
The US beef industry is hoping to make big inroads into South Korea, in the wake of a decision to lift a two-and-a-half year export ban.
Meat and Livestock Australia has already warned that the value of Australian beef exports could fall by up to 20 per cent.
While struggling to regain market share in Japan, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) expects an easier time in Korea.
NCBA trade adviser Greg Doud calls Korea a "very different situation" to Japan, which turned largely to Australian beef after mad cow disease was first found in the US.
"Korea had over a year's worth of US beef in frozen storage, after December the 23rd, 2003," he said.
"And they kept right on moving through that product.
"What we've consistently heard in Korea, is the fact that, once those restaurants and retailers ran out of US beef, they were clamouring for the stuff."
