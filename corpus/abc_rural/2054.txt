Wool market closes the week lower
After its recent strong run, the wool market has suffered a slight correction, finishing the week almost 2.5 per cent lower.
The eastern market indicator fell 19 cents to 825 cents a kilogram.
Analysts say the fall suggests that prices have risen too fast in recent weeks as buyers become nervous about future wool supplies due to the drought.
There was still strong competition from Italian and Chinese buyers at the Newcastle sales, especially for broader microns.
But Craig Brennan from Elders says it could be tougher next week, with many producers trying to make the most of the higher prices.
"Due to the large rise last week the Sydney sale has blown out, originally it was 28,000, it's now increased to 32,000 bales for the week so obviously growers that withheld stock have flooded the market," he said.
"I'd be very surprised if the market held its ground next week with such a considerable offering.
