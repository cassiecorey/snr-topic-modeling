Forecaster offers winter rain hope
With a lot of seed in the ground and many grain growers looking for vital follow-up rains, long-range weather forecasters are offering some hope this winter.
While the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting a drier than average season, others are tipping better conditions, particularly for the southern states.
Queensland-based Hayden Walker, who predicts the weather up to 18 months in advance, reckons this winter will be wetter than last year, although patchy.
'It's going to be a sort of topsy-turvy, or spasmodic, winter. Queensland will have light rains during June, with moderate falls in July, [and] probably get some reasonable falls on a finishing note in August," he said
"NSW will be looking at light to moderate rains in June and some moderate to reasonably good falls for the balance of winter.
