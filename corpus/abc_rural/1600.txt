Fishing industry prepares for $90m license buyback
The fishing industry is set for a major shake-up, with the Federal Government set to spend $90 million buying up fishing licences.
Two hundred licences will be bought back in the first round of the program, designed to ease pressure on the fish stocks and the environment.
Fritz Drenkhahn from the South East Trawl Industry Fishing Association says there will be major changes at most ports.
"It's the biggest change we've had in our fishery ever," he said.
"There will be restructuring on the shore facilities, the ice-maker, the maintenance people, more so the haulage contractor which is now going to be a big issue for the operators left remaining actually getting their fish to market, it's quite an issue.
