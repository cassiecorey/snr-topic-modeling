Hobby farmers work on solving sheep shearing problem
It is hard to find a shearer if you are a hobby farmer and perhaps have just half a dozen pet sheep.
But the growing number of hobby farmers in Western Australia's south-west are working on the problem.
The local community of Manjimup had its sheep shorn, drenched and de-loused for a small fee, with all proceeds to be donated back into the community.
Local shearer Ron Nivon says it is the best way to handle the region's increasing number of pet sheep.
"This is the best thing that ever happened. I think we've been doing it for over 20 years. It's a great cause," he said.
"You don't have that phone ringing and nuisance phone calls asking for five or six sheep shorn when you should be out doing three or 4,000 sheep.
