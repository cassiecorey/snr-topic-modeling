Stripe rust found in NSW, SA wheat crops
The fungal disease, stripe rust, has been discovered in wheat crops in northern New South Wales and South Australia for the first time this year.
The highly contagious disease, which can cut crop yields by up to 50 per cent, has been found between Moree and Narrabri, and on the Yorke Peninsual.
Dr Gordon Murray, from the Department of Primary Industries in New South Wales, says the disease could spread.
He says growers with low yields need to decide whether it is worth using fungicides.
"With the generally dry conditions that will tend to slow the amount of stripe rust but it will also mean that the damage it does will be much less," he said.
"Dryland crops are unlikely to benefit from spraying unless we get a turnaround in the season and a lot more rain."
Stripe rust is found on the leaf of wheat plants, in the form of yellow stripes or spores.
