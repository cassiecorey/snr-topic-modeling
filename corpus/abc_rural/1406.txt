Tanami Gold due to begin first pour
Australia's most remote gold mine is expecting to pour its first gold this weekend.
The Tanami Gold Mine, on the edge of the Tanami Desert in northern Western Australia, opened in May.
It had expected its first gold to be sold last month.
But a number of setbacks, including poor roads for transporting materials, and a lack of workers has pushed back the start date.
Chairman Denis Waddell says after all the delays, they will be taking advantage of the good gold price.
"We'll be selling it, we've got a fair bit of expenditure at the moment, so we're not in the position at the moment were we can punt on where the gold price is going," he said
