Higher sheep prices forecast amid steep demand
The live export industry says it will be forced to offer higher premiums to sheep producers to meet demand.
While producers have moved away from breeding heavy boat sheep towards the prime lamb market, the live trade expects increased demand for mutton in Europe.
Gary Tapscott, from the South Australian Livestock Exporters Association, says with more shipments out of the eastern states expected over the next few months, the trade will be demanding merino wethers coming into winter.
