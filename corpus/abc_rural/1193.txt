Nursery industry loses billions in sales
Queensland's biggest plant-based rural industry is having, by its own admission, its worst year in two decades.
The nursery industry had been worth about half a billion dollars in sales to domestic and export markets a year.
But a drought in the south of the state has cut production and meant a 40 per cent drop in sales to gardeners.
In the north, Cairns nursery operator Daryl Madder says some owners are finding the damage to their stock from cyclone Larry is worse than first thought.
"What we didn't realise at the time was the stock was blown over," he said.
