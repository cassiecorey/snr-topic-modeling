Canegrowers want mandatory levies to curb smut spread
The Queensland Canegrowers organisation wants a national mandatory grower levy to fund efforts to stop the spread of sugarcane smut.
The fungal disease was found almost three months ago near Childers, in Queensland's south-east.
Although a proposed national cost-sharing plan has already been knocked back, the sugar industry says it wants a compulsory levy to raise about $9 million.
But Joe Russo from Isis Canegrowers admits there is still a lot of work to be done.
"We've got to now get New South Wales canegrowers to come on board," he said.
"They've agreed in principle, we've got to get the Ord River - but the other thing we've got to do is - the Federal Government now has got to put mechanisms in place that we need to be able to strike this levy on all cane growing in the Australian sugar industry."
