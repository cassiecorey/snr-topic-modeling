Scientists pool resources to look at illegal fishing impact on sharks
The impact of illegal fishing upon sharks in north Australian waters is being studied, as part of a new research collaboration.
Marine scientists are pooling resources at Darwin's Arafura Timor Research Facility which has cost $3.5 million to build.
Chief executive officer Stuart Fitch says the laboratories allow advanced genetic fingerprinting of marine material, including seized shark fin.
"This is a genetic sequencing analyser or as most people would probably understand it from CSI on TV, DNA analysis," he said.
