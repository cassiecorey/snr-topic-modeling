Fodder exports demand raises local prices
A booming export fodder market is good news for growers but farmers looking to feed livestock in Australia are facing high prices and short supply.
Lucerne prices have almost doubled since November to around $300 a tonne, while hay prices are up between $30 and $40 a tonne.
Colin Peace, from the Fodder Industry Association, says drought in the US and Canada is helping to boost exports, at the expense of the domestic market.
"Those two markets often clash for supply so I think you could anticipate that certainly continuing," he said.
"There are always opportunities for stocks that are destined for export to be diverted for domestic demand.
