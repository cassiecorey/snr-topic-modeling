Analysts downplay mining share price 'correction'
With shares in major mining companies continuing to nosedive, some analysts say the stock market is witnessing an overdue correction.
Prices for metals including copper, iron ore, nickel and zinc have dramatically fallen in recent days, dragging down shares in companies like BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside and Zinifex.
Stocks analyst Peter Stracken says the weakening US economy is partly to blame, but market sentiment is also settling to a much more sustainable level.
Mr Stracken says while miners are being hit with higher production costs, their stocks are fundamentally sound.
"It has been pretty well a free-fall when you get Zinifex falling 10 per cent yesterday in one day," he said.
"You know, when you look at the longer term share price chart, BHP has come from like, $12 or $18 to $30, so now it's back at $26.
"If you bought in the last 6 months or so you're not looking so good but if you bought 3 years ago you're still going to double your money."
Meanwhile new figures from the Bureau of Statistics show export earnings from the minerals energy sector jumped 32 per cent during 2005-06 to a record $90.5 billion.
