Govt accused of sitting on oil review
The Democrats have accused the Federal Government of failing to force the major oil companies to meet their biofuels targets.
The party believes the Government is sitting on a review which reveals the oil companies are less than halfway towards meeting their target of selling 350 megalitres of biofuel by 2010.
Nationals Senator Ron Boswell also believes the oil retailers are not making a big enough effort to adopt alternative fuels.
"I know fairly closely that from the time the Prime Minister called the oil companies in, the oil companies promised the Government that they would sell 89 million litres this year, we're now almost in September and I would expect they've sold about 10 million litres," he said.
"Now that is not honouring the commitment to the Government ... and they need to be brought to account."
The Federal Government has defended the oil companies, saying they are on track to reach the target.
Meanwhile the nation's peak motoring body says fuel prices could surge to a $1.80 a litre by the end of the year.
