Sick sheep seek out healthy food: research
Scientists have known for a long time that sheep seek out foods to gather the nutrients they need, but new research suggests they can choose foods to cure illness.
CSIRO Livestock Industries in Western Australia believe sick sheep will search for plants that make them better.
It is conducting a trial in WA's wheatbelt to work out which plants are eaten by sheep to improve their health and production levels.
Senior research scientist Dr Dean Revell says down the track, farmers might even be able to incorporate "medicinal paddocks" into their farm management.
"Maybe they have to have a continual exposure to these, so they have to be incorporated into the grazing base, the feed base," he said.
"The former option is more attractive, where we can set up and manage a separate paddock and take them there when needed.
