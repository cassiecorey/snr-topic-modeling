US looks to boost fire prevention
Authorities in the United States are looking at more effective ways to deal with severe bushfires.
Jerry Williams, the former director of fire management with the Department of Agriculture, says mega-fires are becoming more dangerous as global warming increases.
He says there needs to be more emphasis on encouraging the community to prevent fires.
"What we do is put everything every effort we can into combatting those fires," he said.
