Confrontation looms over US farm policy
A showdown is looming over US farm policy, one that could be even more fierce in the wake of Congressional elections next month.
The Bush administration has been singing the praises this year of cutting farm supports.
But farm state lawmakers are resisting sweeping reforms and opposition could stiffen if Democrats regain control of at least the House amid several Republican scandals.
Likely Democratic Agriculture chairman, Collin Peterson, blames US WTO concessions.
Mr Peterson says he is not going to give up 60 per cent of the US farm program until the EU, Japan and others give up their barriers to trade.
