Locusts threaten Nullarbor crops
It had appeared that crops near the Nullarbor in South Australia's far west look like being some of the best in the nation because they had received reasonable rain.
But now they are under threat from locusts and local farmers say they are not getting the help they need from the State Government.
Brian Smith from Coorabie, west of Ceduna, says newly hatched locusts are wreaking havoc on crops.
"For the last week at least we've been flat out trying to keep them out the crops as they ripen," he said.
"A lot of the crops in the district now have sort of ripened, but any crops that are a bit later have taken a fair old hammering.
"One farmer I think is probably going to give up on a 400 or 500 acre paddock of barley.
