Avocado growers to compete with NZ imports
With harvest about to begin, avocado growers are facing stiff competition from New Zealand imports.
For the past five years, the imports have petered out before the start of the local harvest but this year a record New Zealand crop has led to a 50 per cent jump in exports to Australia.
North Queensland's Shepard avocados will be the first to be picked here.
Shepard Australia chairman Jim Kochi says growers need to focus on sending quality fruit to the markets.
"They certainly don't have enough people left in New Zealand to consume their crop, I think they're all here in Australia ... most of them and so the rest of it is coming to Australia and it is a large volume of fruit," he said.
