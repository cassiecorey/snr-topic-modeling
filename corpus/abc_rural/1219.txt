Citrus growers ask for frost assistance
Riverland citrus growers who have had crops decimated by frost have asked the Federal Government for exceptional circumstances assistance.
More than 30 per cent of the region's navel orange crop was ruined during a long spell of frosty weather, with temperatures falling to minus seven degrees.
Peter Walker from the South Australian Citrus Industry Development Board says he has approached Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran with the proposal.
'We effectively have said when we have one crop failure that is a significant and he said it had to be prolonged failure so we're arguing that point of view at the moment," Mr Walker said.
