Wheat ship remains idle
A German owned ship loaded with 72,000 tonnes of AWB wheat bound for Sudan remains idle in Port Lincoln in South Australia.
Following negotiations overnight, eight crew members who went on strike over pay and conditions will now be sent back to the Philippines, leaving the ship anchored in the port.
Dean Summers from the International Transport Workers Federation says the ship's owners are looking for more crew but it might be hard to attract them.
"I think it will be a couple of days and these guys will be sent home," he said.
"We have got to wait for the Filipino seafarers to join it again, so there will be eight more guys coming onto this.
"Although the guys coming on will have to realise that they will be expecting wages about half the already low international minimum, so it would not be a very attractive deal for anybody."
