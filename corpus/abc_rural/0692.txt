Dairy operator seeks investor funds
The developers of a large, new dairy venture in South Australia are trying to attract cash from the managed investment sector.
Believed to be the first scheme of its kind in the state, the $15 million project at Tintinara, south of Adelaide, follows investor interest in vineyards, olive and blue gum plantations.
Developer Peter Ryan says high demand from milk processors and steady returns to farmers are making the dairy industry more attractive to investors.
"International indicators are good, here in Australia projections for demand continue to exceed projections for supply," he said.
