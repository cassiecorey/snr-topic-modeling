Grown in Australia label a step closer
The food processing industry is closer to developing a new label to clearly show whether food has been grown in Australia.
Producers and some processors are concerned that current labels are misleading when it comes to how much Australian product is included.
The Federal Government has set up a working group to examine the issue and member David Gartrell says they have developed a workable proposal.
"What the working group endorsed at the moment is implementing a grown in Australia logo that would extend original brand options for packaged food products beyond the existing made in product of," he said.
