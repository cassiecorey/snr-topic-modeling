Incitec Pivot to buy Southern Cross
In a complex stock market deal, superphosphate fertiliser company Incitec Pivot has announced it plans to buy out Australia's only producer of ammonium phosphates, Southern Cross.
Trading in Incitec Pivot shares has been halted for two days while share holders learn details of the deal, which includes Orica selling its 70 per cent share holding in Incitec.
Incitec will recommend share holders buy back Orica shares.
Chairman of Incitec Pivot John Watson says the 35,000 farmers with shares in the company should enjoy significant growth in profits.
"All this does is add to our manufacturing base a very important strategic asset, not only for our business but for the farmers of Australia as well," he said.
