EC farmer assistance requires rethink, expert says
An environmental and climatic change risk analyst says the Federal Government needs to rethink its exceptional circumstances (EC) assistance to farmers.
The University of Canberra's Dr Brian Button says he is opposed to EC funding because floods and droughts are a natural occurrence and not exceptional.
He says the Government should look at other ways of helping.
"Now in Canada the Federal Government sponsors to the tune of about $2 billion Canadian a year a crop insurance scheme," he said.
