Endangered cockatoo could scuttle pulp mill
Developers of a proposed $650 million pulp mill at Penola in South Australia fear six dead trees will scuttle their project.
The river red gums are potential breeding sites for the endangered red-tailed black cockatoo.
The Federal Department of Environment and Heritage has declared the project will have a significant impact on the bird, and referred the matter to the Minister, Ian Campbell, for a final decision.
Project manager John Roche says his Protavia company is very disappointed with the decision.
