WA grain growers look to the skies
Grain growers in WA's south-east who are generally enjoying a reasonable season say they are now in need of good rain to see crops finish well.
Farmers from all over the agricultural region are gathering in Newdegate 450 kilometres south east of Perth, for the town's annual machinery field days.
After floods swept through the region in January, and a very late start, local farmer Trevor de Landgrafft says farmers are now relying heavily on rain in coming months.
"I think the October rain's going to be the most important for the district," he said.
