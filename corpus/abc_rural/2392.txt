Drought blamed for lucerne crop failure
Dryland lucerne production in the upper south-east of South Australia has been hit hard by the drought with virtually no hay cut this year.
The area between Tintinara and Naracoorte is generally regarded as one of the nation's biggest lucerne hay-producing regions but has recorded its lowest rainfall totals in a century.
Charlie Hilton from Lucerne Australia says if there is no rain in the next three months, it is possible some long-established lucerne stands will be lost.
"If stands have thinned out to be not economic to leave, they are going to have to be re-established," he said.
"Once you do that, you virtually lose production off those dryland paddocks for a year.
