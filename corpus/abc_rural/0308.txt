Govt urged to buy Snowy Hydro scheme
The Federal Government is being called on to buy Snowy Hydro and keep it as a publicly-owned water and power asset.
The call was unanimously made at an angry meeting of 350 people at Cooma, in southern New South Wales last night, who are opposed to the joint state and federal sell-off.
The scheme is expected to earn $3 billion if the sale goes ahead this year, but Snowy River Mayor Richard Wallace says public ownership is much more important.
