Record floods hit gulf country
Graziers in Queensland's gulf country are still trying to assess damage caused by record floods.
Heavy rain from ex-tropical cyclone Larry has caused both the Leichhardt and Alexandra Rivers to burst their banks, covering up to 40 kilometres.
There have also been reports of sharks spotted near a homestead, 80 kilometres inland from the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Further south, Michael Crisp from Lorraine Station, says more than 250 millimetres of rain has flooded areas he never believed would go under.
"Part of our farm, our irrigated farm has been really heavily damaged," he said.
"There was up to 900 acres of corn sown and 60 or 70 acres of sorghum that had about three or four foot of water go over it and appears to be buggered altogether."
But in sharp contrast, cattle are perishing in Queensland's far south-west, because it has been so dry.
