Camp cooks in demand
Camp cooks and grader drivers are proving the hardest jobs to fill on cattle stations in northern Australia this year.
The lure of high-paying mining jobs has kept many away from the Kimberley, in particular.
While they have been lucky to get a full team at Flora Valley Station near Halls Creek, manager Wayne Bean says camp cooks are a dying breed.
"One time, once people finished working as stockhands or ringers on stations they found their little niche in life, either cooking for the station, or driving the grader or running as a bore runner but that just doesn't seem to be happening now," he said.
"People are drifting off into the mines and other big corporations and there's still a few that seem who enjoy being on the stations, and it's not about money for them.
