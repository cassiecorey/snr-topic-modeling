Logging detrimental to possums' sex life: study
The results of a five-year study claims farming and logging is having an impact on the sex life of possums.
The mountain brush tail possum of north-eastern Victoria has been in the spotlight, and found to only have one mate in areas which have been cleared.
Professor Jenny Martin, from the University of Melbourne, says monogamy is rare in mammals, and it is occurring because there are fewer trees for sleeping and eating.
"But at the other site where there was heaps and heaps of large trees with hollows, huge amounts of food trees and most importantly that those two types of trees were very close to one another, females could have extremely small home ranges while still getting access to the same amount of resources in terms of food and shelter," she said.
