Wine cheaper than bottled water
A supermarket in Australia's second largest wine growing region is currently selling wine more cheaply than bottled water.
In another sign of the wine industry's plight, the Fisher's supermarket chain in north-west Victoria's Sunraysia area has locally produced cleanskin reds and whites for $2 a bottle.
Director Alan Fisher says he is not cashing in on the difficulties of wine-grape growers in his local community because the only answer to the oversupply will be to move excess stocks.
"There is a huge glut and we have got to get rid of it somehow," he said.
"I think what we are seeing is people selling it to people like ourselves to get rid of it as a cleanskin.
