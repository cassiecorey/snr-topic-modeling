Farmers debate single desk
Meanwhile Victorian grain growers are debating how they would like their wheat marketed overseas at a major forum in Bendigo today.
Sitting in a hot carpark under a marquee are just under 400 farmers, who have travelled several hundred kilometres from Swan Hill and Horsham, as well as other grain growing areas to have their say on the single desk.
The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF), who have organised today's forum, wants to retain the single desk and have it controlled by growers.
