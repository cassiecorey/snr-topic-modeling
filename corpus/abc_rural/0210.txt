Key US retailers back wool campaign
Two key US retailers have backed the wool industry's multi-million dollar test marketing campaign to get American shoppers to buy more wool.
Three bodies are funding the campaign, including Australian Wool Innovation, promotional body Woolmark, and the International Wool Textile Organisation.
Head of Woolmark Brenda Mcgahan says the campaign, to be launched in September, is also trying to boost the price of wool for growers and manufacturers.
"It is a major issue for our growers and also for the international wool pipeline," she said.
"A consumer can't buy wool if the retailer doesn't stock it, and a retailer isn't going to stock wool if they don't think consumers are going to buy it.
"We'll be working with their buying teams and their sales associates, because why would a consumer pay a premium for something if they don't understand the benefits and a good sales man or woman needs to be able to explain to a consumer why you're going to pay more for a product."
Those two US retailers have not yet been named.
Australian Wool Innovation has appointed Dr John Keniry to chair its 2006 WoolPoll Panel.
Dr Keniry led the review in the live animal export trade in 2003.
The poll of woolgrowers is held every three years, to set the level of the wool tax.
The wool market slipped again at auctions this week, with the eastern market indicator dropping off eight cents, to 728 cents a kilogram clean.
Landmark agent Rodney Peglar, says while a seasonal record was paid for a superfine bale from northern region, the broader wools performed particularly poorly.
"It's two markets, there are the good wools and unfortunately due to seasonal conditions the buyers are having tremendous trouble being able to find enough wool to make batches up that are sound, or of the right quality," he said.
