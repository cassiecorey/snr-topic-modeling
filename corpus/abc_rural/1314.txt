Polybag price increase hurts producers
The price of the woven polybags used to package seed, wool and fertiliser is set to rise due to soaring crude oil prices.
The bags are made from a petroleum-based resin, which has increased in price and is becoming harder to source from Asia.
Bob Adams, from Colquhouns Fremantle Bag company says producers can no longer absorb the cost, and are now looking at other options.
"We've seen costs rise by as much as 30 to 35 per cent over the last eight to nine months to the point it's slowly being passed onto the packers and the users of the bags," he said.
