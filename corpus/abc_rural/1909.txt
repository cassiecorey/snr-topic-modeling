Mixed response to CBH's wheat export push
There has been mixed reaction in Western Australia to the state's main grain handler CBH launching a bid to export two million tonnes of wheat this harvest.
CBH announced it would offer grain growers $265-275 a tonne, topping the offer of monopoly exporter AWB.
The Western Australian Farmers Federation says the plan encourages short-term thinking and it is worried about the impact of taking so much grain from the national pool.
But Leon Bradley, from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, says growers should have another wheat export option.
"Well the main benefit is too obvious to state," he said.
"$20 or $30 above AWB's estimate, which is very significant in a low production year in terms of farm profitability."
Meanwhile, the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, has further opened divisions in the Coalition over the future of the single desk wheat export system.
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile says the Government remains committed to the single desk until the Cole inquiry into AWB kickback allegations reports.
But Mr Costello has suggested wheat growers should get the chance to export wheat at the higher rates being offered by CBH.
