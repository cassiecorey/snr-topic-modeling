Drought blamed for cattle indicator drop
A lack of rain is being blamed for the biggest weekly fall in the Eastern Young Cattle Indicator since April last year.
The indicator of prices from saleyards in the eastern states is considered a guide to general price trends.
It fell 14 cents last week and is hovering around $3.60, compared to $4.00 at the same time last year.
Peter Weeks, from Meat and Livestock Australia, says if it does not rain the market could fall by up to 60 cents a kilo.
"Certainly without widespread rain in the next four to six weeks, I think we will see prices fall back further," he said.
"They will gradually decline moving into late this year and early next year, simply because demand is coming back on export markets and we've got the spring supply about to come on."
In the south-west of Western Australia a surge of dairy herds on to the market has caused the price of cows to fall $150 per head.
With low demand locally, dairy farmers from the east are buying cows, trucking them across the Nullarbor, and still saving between $100 and $200 per head.
Livestock agent Karl Harnett says with more WA farmers leaving the industry, there is a big gap for the eastern states to capitalise on.
"Basically right across the eastern seaboard over the last 12 months there has been a shortage of dairy cattle, especially quality dairy cattle," he said.
"Within in the last six months we've probably seen around 700 to 800 dairy cattle that have moved across the border.
