Noxious weed found to benefit salmon
A Tasmanian scientific researcher is turning one of Australia's most noxious weeds into beneficial omega-3 oils.
Matthew Miller has found that feeding pattersons curse, or salvation jane, to salmon significantly increases their levels of the healthy oils.
Mr Miller began using oil extracted from the weed as fish food after identifying the particular compounds needed to stimulate omega-3 production.
"Patterson's curse have this really unique special oil and pattersons curse has the highest level of this oil," he said.
