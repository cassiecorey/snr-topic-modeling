Wool supporters confident about marketing campaign
The backers of a new $8 million campaign to market Australian wool in the US say they are confident it will not be hijacked by animal rights groups.
A lucrative deal between Italian fashion house Benetton and Australian Wool Innovation collapsed six weeks ago, with some laying the blame on animal welfare protests against mulesing.
The campaign being launched today will test how effectively fine wool can be marketed to women through New York fashion label Saks Fifth Avenue.
Brenda McGahan from Australian Wool Services says they have addressed the retailer's concerns about mulesing and are confident it will not pull out.
"That's a very difficult question," he said.
