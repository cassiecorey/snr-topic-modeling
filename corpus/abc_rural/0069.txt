Growers vote to keep wheat export's single desk
Grain growers in Victoria have formally shown their support for keeping the single desk for wheat exports.
Almost 330 growers voted to retain the single desk, at the annual Victorian Farmers Federation Grains Conference.
Grains group president Ian Hastings says it is a strong result.
"We've got a very very clear message that people want single desk and at this point in time they are not including how or who the manager will be," Mr Hastings said.
"They want single desk marketing, which is what we've been saying all along, and at the end of the Cole inquiry is the time when we will then look at what the structure will be to ensure that we have a single-desk marketing system."
Meanwhile a better outlook for crop prospects in the US has hit domestic grain prices.
Chicago wheat futures have dropped more than 3 per cent in the past 10 days, with rain and snow expected to help US crops.
Leonie O'Driscoll from Agfarm marketing says the fall is being felt.
"Already we have seen domestic end users drop their buying values by about $10 a tonne," she said.
