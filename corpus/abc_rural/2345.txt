Win for avocado growers in blight fight
Avocado growers have won their fight for tougher restrictions to protect the industry from the fungal disease, avocado blight.
Biosecurity Australia has imposed stronger rules for imported New Zealand avocado, including a ban on any fruit with windrub, which looks the same as blight.
Avocadoes Australia's Chris Nelson says the new protocols could lead to a rise in the cost of fruit for consumers.
"Because there will be less fruit exported to Australia there will be a change in that supply and demand balance and inevitably I guess the prices may rise to a certain extent so they're looking towards probably a better return for the fruit they do send over," he said.
Random inspections will be conducted on Australian fruit orchards this summer to ensure growers are not breaching plant breeders' rights.
