Golden Circle back in the black
Queensland food processor Golden Circle has announced a jump in profits, less than three months after appointing a new chief executive.
Despite losing $26 million in 2003, the company made a $10.4 million profit before tax last year.
Chief executive John Cox says he has also improved communication between the company and its grower shareholders.
"Golden Circle recognises that we are going to have to do things a lot smarter, and more in line with our growers," he said.
