Bushfires spark concerns for koala population
Fears are held for the biggest koala population in New South Wales, which is under threat from bushfires in the state's north-west.
The state's new wildlife rescue service has travelled today to the Pilliga region to assess the koalas, with Taronga and Western Plains Zoo on standby to accept any injured animals.
