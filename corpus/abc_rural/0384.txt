Water in the bank
While water scarcity is not much of an issue in the Top End at the moment, in central Australia attempts to develop a new horticulture industry depend very much on new water saving technology. The water re-use project in Alice Springs has been under development for some time but emerging technology could make a number of similar projects viable and workable. Professor Stuart White from Sydney's University of Technology has worked on water saving projects with governments and councils around Australia and he says there is a new sense of urgency to develop water savings projects. "When we start to move away from the urban sector and talk about water use more generally and remember 80 per cent of water is not used in towns and cities it's actually used in irrigated agriculture and so on, we do have to take a bit of a long hard look at some of the industries that are using water and say is this appropriate and what is the trade off between the impact of some of these industries and the impact on water ways and the benefit we derive from them. However there is huge scope for efficiency there, I mean we're talking about efficiency levels which can be improved even beyond what we're talking about in the cities, in terms of relatively low cost savings, and some of those are starting to be picked up and that's a good thing."
