Mary River dam decision outrages farmers
Farmers near Gympie remain outraged with the Queensland Government, despite its decision to scale back the size of a proposed new dam on the Mary River.
Premier Peter Beattie initially planned a 660,000 megalitre dam, which would have consumed almost 1,000 properties.
But he now says a smaller dam will be built, with the resumption of 500 properties.
Under the three-stage plan, the dam wall would be raised if more water is needed in 2035.
But locals at a public meeting to hear the details were furious, saying they will be left in limbo for 30 years.
"I've been living here 30 years and been waiting to retire," one said.
"I'd been retired one week when he dropped this bombshell."
Another resident said: "Some people in stage one will get bought out there's no doubt if they proceed, and so they've divided the community even more.
"And they left these people in stage two to whither on the vine."
