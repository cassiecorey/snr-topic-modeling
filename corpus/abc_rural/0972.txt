Cowra abattoir cleared over sackings
The Cowra abattoir in New South Wales has been cleared over its decision to dismiss 29 employees under the new WorkChoices laws, and re-hire some under a different award.
The Office of Workplace Services has found the company did not break the new laws, and its actions would still have been lawful under the old legislation.
The Federal Government says it has been vindicated by the ruling.
