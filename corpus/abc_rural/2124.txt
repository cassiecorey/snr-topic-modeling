Water restrictions may be toughened in Adelaide
The South Australian Cabinet is considering tougher water restrictions for Adelaide by the end of the year.
The River Murray Minister, Karlene Maywald, says she is disappointed that the city's consumption has increased since restrictions took effect.
She says stronger limits are needed because of a lack of understanding in Adelaide about the seriousness of the water shortage.
"I'm certain that Adelaide people don't understand the severity of the situation because we need to get that this is not a normal circumstance and this is the worse drought in history," she said.
