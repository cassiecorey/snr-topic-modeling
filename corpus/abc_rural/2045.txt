Apricot orchard records bumper harvest
An apricot orchard in far western New South Wales has bounced back from having its lowest recorded yield last year to a bumper harvest this season.
The Tandou company says it can not plant cotton near Menindee this year because water allocations are too low.
But spokesman Vince Trotter says the big results in Tandou's orchard will influence the company's future.
