Wool companies look at partial integration
The boards of Australia's two peak wool companies are still talking up the industry's future despite now having to look at ways of joining forces without a full merger.
Plans to unit Australian Wool Services (AWS) with Australian Wool Innovation are on hold while the Federal Government decides whether to help AWS pay off a $27 million overseas debt.
Chairman Barry Walker is hopeful the Government will come to the rescue, but says the two companies are looking at how to integrate parts of their organisations anyway.
"There are certainly major savings in running a single company," he said.
