Study to investigate irrigation scheme
The Tasmanian Government is looking at building the state's biggest irrigation scheme.
A study will look at the possibility of diverting water used for hydro electricity to farmers in some of the driest parts of the state.
Farmer Richard Gardiner says power generation should no longer be the only use for the water.
"If you look at the state of water availability in the whole country and you look at the fact that there's 2,000 odd megalitres a day earning $10 a megalitres, I think there is no other way we can go into the future," he said.
