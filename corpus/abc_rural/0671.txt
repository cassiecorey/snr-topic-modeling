Doctors urge govt reform on rural medical services
Doctors say access to obstetric services in rural Australia is becoming critical and are calling for urgent government reform.
In allegations to be aired on ABC's Four Corners program tonight, doctors also claim that in some areas chemotherapy is being administered by people without formal qualifications.
They have also raised concerns about the loneliness of cancer patients forced to move to the city for treatment and the pressures that are forcing doctors to pack up and leave country towns.
Dr Ross Maxwell from the Rural Doctors Association says the problems are acute and most efforts to solve them are not making much difference.
"We have been reluctant to try and look at the economics around rural and remote practice and say well if the mining industry want to get professionals out into a remote community they make sure the conditions are right and attractive and can get them out there," he said.
