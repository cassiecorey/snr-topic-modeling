Turf industry loses out to rising water restrictions
Tightening water restrictions in many parts of Australia are taking their toll on the turf-laying industry.
The industry has lost $15 million this year, as home owners become reluctant to lay grass they cannot water.
Turf Producers Australia spokesman Ray Moir says South Australia has been the hardest state hit by the drought, with its largest business deciding to close its doors after 25 years.
"It's having varying effects from state to state," he said.
