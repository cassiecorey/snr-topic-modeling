Copper find excites stock market investors
A small copper explorer has shot out of obscurity after discovering rich veins of the metal near Cloncurry, in north-west Queensland.
Shares in Australian Mining Investment shot from 29 cents seven weeks ago to a top of $10 yesterday, turning it into a billion-dollar company.
It says drilling at its Rocklands copper deposit is continuing around the clock to feed the stock market more news.
Hartley's mining expert Rob Brierley says little is known so far about the Rocklands deposit.
"Not very much at all - I think that's what captured the imagination of the market," he said.
"In fact it's really been a meteoric rise.
"There is a long way for this company to go, but it's great to see that a discovery can still capture the imagination of the investment public."
