Wool growers reject diazinon alternatives
The peak body representing wool growers wants to hold on to access to a common lice control chemical, despite health concerns.
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is recommending that diazinon no longer be used to dip or jet sheep.
Wool Producers's Greg Weller wants the authority to consider protective equipment and new methods for dipping, because some of the alternatives create other problems.
