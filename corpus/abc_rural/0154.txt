Brisbane company to take majority stake in US ethanol producer
A Brisbane-based company will take up a 60 per cent stake in the United States' biggest farmer-owned ethanol producer.
Farmer members of Midwest Grain Processors in Iowa voted to support Global Ethanol's bid this morning.
David Nelson from Midwest Grain Processors says the deal will lead to a massive expansion of ethanol production both in the US and Australia.
