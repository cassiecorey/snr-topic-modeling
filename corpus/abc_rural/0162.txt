Town to feel impact of workers' sacking, says union
The sacking of 29 workers at an abattoir at Cowra in central western New South Wales is fuelling debate over the Federal Government's new workplace relations laws.
Unions say the workers have been told they can apply for 20 new positions, with a $200 a week pay cut.
Charlie Donzow from the Meat Industry Employees Union says the whole town will feel the impact.
"By reducing workers' income, it means that it reduces the overall expenditure within the immediate town and area so that does have a flow-on effect to the overall town economy," he said.
"Now the new Workchoices legislation unfortunately allows companies to take this position because they can simply claim it's because of operational reasons."
