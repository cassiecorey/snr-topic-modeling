Grain growers' future not looking rosy
Changing weather patterns, weed resistance and higher input costs are putting pressure on grain farm incomes, despite more land being cropped than ever before.
In the short term, farm incomes will go up but figures from ABARE and the Grains Research and Development Corporation, say the picture is not as rosy further out.
Increased production in Australia and strong global competition will keep grain prices low.
Agricultural analyst Neil Clark says average-sized farmers have tough times ahead.
"The price of grain has been falling at about an average of 2.2 per cent for the last 28 years and yet we all know that the costs of fertiliser, fuel and in particular debt servicing are going to be at an all time high for the coming cropping season and the commodity prices aren't all that great yet," he said.
"It's always great for the top 25 per cent and if we look at any of the ABARE studies they do shine.
