Farmers log on to livestock sales
Rising fuel costs and more user-friendly technology are said to be driving a jump in the number of farmers selling livestock over the Internet.
Elders sells around 3 per cent of Australia's sheep, lambs and cattle in online auctions.
Jack Gleeson from Elders says it is saving farmers the cost of trucking livestock to saleyards.
"Normally there would be freight involved from the point of origin, the vendor's property to the saleyard," he said.
