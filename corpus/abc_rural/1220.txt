Poppy growers asked to boost production
Tasmanian poppy growers have been asked at the last minute if they can plant an extra 2,000 hectares of poppies.
Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced in April it would cut contracts by 90 per cent because of a world oversupply, but it has now secured a long-term deal that will clear out its reserve stocks.
Spokesman Mike Doyle says the company's relationship with growers may have been damaged, but he hopes they will come to the party.
"The timing's unfortunate I admit," Mr Doyle said.
"We certainly would have liked to have known at a different time of the year, but these sorts of negotiations are very involved and complicated and we are in a position now at least to see if there's ground out there available."
