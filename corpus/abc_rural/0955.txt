Frost hits Riversun's US exports
A company exporting citrus fruit to the United States says shipments are likely to drop 20 per cent this season, due to frost damage in the Murray Valley, Riverland and Riverina.
Riversun chairman Peter Walker says supermarkets in the US are aware of the damage to the Victorian and South Australian crops, but he is confident sales will not be affected.
"It's one of the transparencies that Riversun has," he said.
"It goes out and tells the customer base that we have procedures and policies in place and it's adhering to them.
"If it's minus two for more than four hours properties are put into suspension until they are assessed to see if there is any damage on that property, so we've explained that to supermarkets and they are all still on board."
