SA investigates wine partnership with Chile
The Chilean Government is looking at a partnership with the wine industry in South Australia's Barossa Valley.
Chile's Foreign Minister and Ambassador have made a flying visit to the region to talk about a joint effort to sell wine to Asia.
State MP Ivan Venning says although Chile is a major competitor, it is worth investigating.
"I was initially quite cautious because why would you want to do a deal with an international competitor, as Chile is with us, in the world of wine but I think the Australian wine, particularly our Barossa wines and the Chilean wines do complement each other because they don't have the premium reds like we have," Mr Venning said.
