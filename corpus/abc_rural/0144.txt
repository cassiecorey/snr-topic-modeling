McCain, potato growers settle price row
After nine months, Victorian potato growers have finally reached a price agreement with food processor McCain.
The company had been offering lower prices, which farmers said would make the industry unviable.
The McCain Growers Group says neither farmers nor the company are happy with the deal because there was compromise on both sides.
Chief executive Tony Pitt says growers have accepted $2.75 a tonne less than last year's price.
"There is a price now that will operate now for 2006 deliveries and also for 2007 and that price will be $227.25," he said.
