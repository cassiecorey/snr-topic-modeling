Court dismisses farmer's uranium concerns
A farmer at Esperance in Western Australia is fighting to stop uranium exploration on her property.
Yvonne Hallam took court action this week to try to stop the exploration application but her case was dismissed.
She says she is worried about biosecurity problems from letting people on to her land.
"I think we've got the right to continue with the farming that we've been doing for probably 40 years, and people before us, and people after us without having to worry about who's coming and going, and opening, and shutting gates, or maybe not shutting gates and all that sort of thing," she said.
