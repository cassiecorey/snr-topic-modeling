Rot destroys pink lady exports
An unusual fruit skin condition not seen in Australia before is hurting exporters of pink lady apples from Western Australia.
The rot has destroyed about 40 per cent of this year's exports to the United Kingdom and there are fears more could be rejected in a shipment of 800 tonnes of fruit currently on its way.
Experts from Australia and the UK say they have never seen browning this early in the season and are trying to find what is causing it.
Angelo Logiudice from the WA Apple and Pear Council says it has having a huge impact.
"In real terms 35 to 40 per cent loss after packing is huge losses because you've already sustained some losses as you are sorting fruit for export packing, so this is going to be huge for growers," he said.
