GM canola shipment contaminated: AQIS
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has confirmed a 57,000 tonne shipment of imported genetically-modified (GM) canola is contaminated with Canadian barley and weeds.
The shipment arrived at the Port of Newcastle this week.
It will be processed in Newcastle into protein meal and vegetable oil, and sold to the food and biodiesel industries.
National manager for Plant Programs at AQIS Peter Liehne says it is common for bulk commodities to contain other material.
"In this case we found that there are some seeds present in the shipment which have sufficient concern for us to look at the management of the product to ensure there is no risk to the environment resulting from these weed seeds," he said.
