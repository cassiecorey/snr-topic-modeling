Shake-up for wool industry
The wool industry is set for a major shakeup, with the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) to abandon its auction rooms in Sydney and Melbourne and slash the size of its board.
AWEX will end its auction room leases at Yennora in Sydney and Brooklyn in Melbourne by the end of the year, handing the ball to wool brokers, who already run sales rooms in Newcastle and Fremantle.
A review of company services has found the wool industry holds market reporting and wool classer services above the provision of selling centres, although grower bodies and exporters have been surprised by the decision.
Chris Kelly from exporter Itochu says rival auctions by Australian Wool Handlers has put AWEX under pressure.
"Look I'm quite sure that if AWH didn't do what they did, I think this decision wouldn't have been made," he said.
"I think the exporters now would quite rightly question the benefit of AWEX in regard to saleroom issues."
