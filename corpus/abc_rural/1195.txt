Producers stop culling sheep
Thanks to some much needed rain in Western Australia, producers in Northampton in the state's wheatbelt region have now stopped culling their sheep.
In the northern agricultural regions, around 13,000 lambs and ewes have been destroyed and another 15,000 have died, because the season has been too hard.
Craig Walker from Elders says it is a relief that producers can stop culling, now that there is some green pick around.
"People didn't make that decision light-heartedly," he said.
