Row erupts between Grains Council and Agriculture Minister
A rift has emerged between Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran and Australia's peak grain lobby.
The Grains Council is outraged that the oil-for-food inquiry is being used as an excuse to backflip on plans to reduce a key levy for the Wheat Export Authority.
The council wanted the industry levy reduced from 22 cents a tonne to 19, leaving the authority with a million dollar cash surplus.
Spokesman David Ginns says the surplus will now be doubled and has accused Mr McGauran of ignoring growers.
"There have been a number of matters that we've raised with him where he hasn't taken the advice of the key industry body and we are concerned that our batting average is not particularly good at the moment and we seem to be getting some excuses back at the moment," he said.
But in an unprecedented attack on a peak commodity council, Mr McGauran has accused the Grains Council of acting dishonourably and not working in the best interests of growers.
Mr McGauran says the council has also deliberately leaked confidential ministerial documents and spread misinformation.
"I believe this is an ill-considered and ill-timed intervention by the Grains Council which is more puzzling than anything else," he said.
