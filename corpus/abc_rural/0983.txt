Cotton properties fail to sell
Two large multi-million dollar cotton properties in south west Queensland have failed to sell at auction.
The Queensland Government had planned to buy the farms to return water to the Murray Darling Basin, but withdrew because it did not have the support of the New South Wales or Federal Governments.
The properties, Clyde and Ballandool, with water licences totalling 58,000 megalitres were expected to make about $60 million at auction on Friday.
Ballandool was passed in at $20 million, while Clyde is still under negotiation at $27 million.
Ian Cush from the New South Wales Irrigators Association says the properties have little stored water and growers could not afford to invest and not have a return.
