Farmers look to overhaul image
A campaign to overhaul the image of Australian farmers kicks off in Queensland today.
The "Every Family needs a Farmer" promotion is being run by Agforce and features the Coe family, from Durong, in the state's south.
Cattle and grain producer Karen Coe hopes it will change city people's perceptions of agriculture.
"Just even on small terms we have friends come out and say goodness you've got lots of trees and they don't fully understand that the way we farm these days is very different to driving a tractor around the paddock and ploughing, ploughing and ploughing," she said.
