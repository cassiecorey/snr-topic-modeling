Resources industry staffing problems expected to worsen
Finding and retaining staff is one of the biggest issues facing Australia's booming resources industry, according to a new study.
The People at Work report, published by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, says the issue is only going to get worse.
Author Bernard Salt says the problem in hanging onto staff has a lot to do with different values between the generations.
"We have always assumed that we're the best country in the world and everyone will automatically want to come to Australia to work," he said.
