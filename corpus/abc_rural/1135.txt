Farmers seek better food label laws for online shopping
Farmers say an oversight by Australia's peak food regulator is allowing fruit and vegetables to be sold on the Internet without new country-of-origin labelling.
Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) introduced the tougher labelling laws last month after farmers fought for imported food to be clearly identified.
However, with major supermarkets now offering online grocery sales, the rules do not apply.
Brian Bond from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says FSANZ should have identified the issue.
"It's obviously been an oversight by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand and it's something that certainly needs to be looked at and if we can plug the gap we should," he said.
"We need sales and I guess this area of sales is going to increase rather than decrease so it's certainly something that needs addressing."
Lydia Buchtmunn from FSANZ says the issue has not been overlooked.
"Actually we've been addressing that for quite a long time we've been looking at the whole labelling standard to look at things perhaps that are home delivered," she said.
