US farm payments tipped to fall
Domestic farm payments in the United States are likely to fall under a new farm bill to be introduced next year.
The US has offered to reduce tariffs and subsidies as part of the Doha world trade talks, but will need to reform its domestic policies first.
Visiting Australia, senior economist with the US Department of Agriculture, Carole Goodloe says average farm incomes are well above other sectors, and government assistance is harder to justify.
"Just about all the major players are saying it's time for some reform," she said.
