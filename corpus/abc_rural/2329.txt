Wholesalers not happy with fruit and veg code
The controversial regulatory code of conduct for the fruit and vegetable industry is expected to be signed off by the Governor-General today.
But sections of the industry still are not happy with it.
The code specifies how wholesalers and growers must deal with each other in the future, but excludes supermarkets, the big retailers and processors.
Wholesaler Andrew Young, from the Central Markets Association of Australia, says the code he has seen will be a cost burden for everyone.
"It adds significant administration costs. There's legal requirements that have been introduced, which growers must obtain legal advice prior to executing an agreement with a wholesaler. There's much more prescription in terms of how wholesalers can and cannot act and virtually requiring in excess 90 per cent of the industry to totally change how they've done business for many many years," he said.
