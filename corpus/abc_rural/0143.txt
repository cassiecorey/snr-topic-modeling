More professionals choosing part-time work in regional areas
New figures show balancing work and family is beginning to bite in rural professions already short of staff.
Research by the Australian Rural and Remote Workforce Agencies shows doctors, vets and teachers are increasingly choosing to work part-time.
Almost 40 per cent of country GPs work half a full-time shift.
But spokeswoman Martina Stanley says it can be a positive in attracting professionals to country areas.
"We're trying to achieve a system whereby we can support them so that they don't have to work the way that doctors did once upon a time," she said.
"The impact is felt more significantly in rural areas because traditionally rural doctors have worked longer hours on average than metropolitan doctors.
The Nationals want more safeguards to protect the diversity of regional news services before they will support media ownership changes.
The Federal Government wants to let media owners operate across radio, television and print, leading to fears of consolidation in rural areas.
But Nationals leader Mark Vaile says businesses must be protected from increased advertising costs, while community groups must have access to locally-based newsrooms.
