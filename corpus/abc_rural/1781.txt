King Is plantation development ban worries timber industry
Tasmania's timber industry is worried that a ban on plantation development on King Island will set a precedent.
The chief executive of the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, Terry Edwards, says he is surprised that the planning policy to prohibit plantations on the island was upheld yesterday after legal scrutiny.
He is concerned other councils will now try to limit plantation development.
"We now have a situation seemingly in Tasmania where councils can tell farmers what crops they can or cannot grow on their land," he said.
