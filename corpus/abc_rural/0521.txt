Northern growers put price cap on bananas
It is pretty rare for producers to knock back money, but with soaring prices a small group of north Queensland banana growers have decided to put a price cap on their fruit.
Pacific Coast Eco Bananas, which won an award last night for farming in an environmentally sustainable manner, says sustainability needs to apply to all sectors of the business.
In the wake of cyclone Larry some bananas have sold for more than $100 a carton, but the company's Dianne Sciacca says that level cannot be sustained, with the price cap set at $70.
"I think if you're serious about sustainability, you have to live within a sustainable business environment as well and we ask a premium price for our product of which that is supported by the supermarkets and our customers in the market place," she said.
