Bushfire battle continues in Tas
Firefighters continue to battle large bushfires threatening the townships of St Mary's and Irish Town in Tasmania's north-east.
The fire front is about a kilometre north of the towns, near the German Town Road, and fanned by north-easterly winds.
Tasmanian Fire Service district officer Steve Lowe says crews are working on control burning while conditions allow, but are bracing for an unfavourable weather change tomorrow,
"It's still moving quite slowly at this time however the forecast is not favourable for firefighting at all," he said.
