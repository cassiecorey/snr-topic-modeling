Community holds vigil for rain
The small community of Mono in Queensland's Burnett region is turning to prayer in an attempt to make it rain.
The district's main water storage, Cania Dam, is at just six per cent of capacity after years of drought.
Local pastor Estelle Hawkins is hoping that people from all walks of life will join the 24-hour prayer vigil.
"I think it is critical. I guess I hear a lot of people saying why haven't we had rain, and I thought, as I read the Bible, I see there, God says, 'Your prayers aren't being answered because you aren't asking'," she said.
"And I thought, 'Right, why shouldn't we put aside some time together?'"
