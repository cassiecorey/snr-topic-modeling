Disease outbreak hits abalone industry
The abalone industry in south-west Victoria says it will take at least 12 months to recover from an outbreak of the herpes-like virus, ganglioneuritis.
Four abalone farms have been hit by the disease.
Tim Rudge from Allestree Coastal Seafarms at Portland says it appears the outbreak came from wild breeding stock, and is a severe setback.
"So we've had to lay people off and the other unfortunate thing is that in the south-west here we have developed a fantastic relationship here with the two local processors," he said.
