US grain growers anxious to control ethanol plants
Australian investment in US ethanol plants is causing a stir among US grain growers, who are anxious to hold onto control of their new industry.
Mid-west US producers said at a farm bill listening session they are concerned foreign investors that Wall Street might gain too much control of US ethanol production.
National Farmers Union president Tom Buis says "it's been a 30-year struggle, basically by farmers to get this industry kick-started. And now that it's arrived, they just don't want to sit back and watch the control and all the profits go elsewhere".
