Mining bursaries offered to WA students
The Federal Government has established a $500 mining careers bursary, to encourage students to take up careers in the mining industry.
The cash is on offer to 30 year 10 students who choose to take on the challenging maths and science subjects that are pre-requisites for entry into mining courses at Western Australian universities.
Eric Lindsay, from Curtin University's school of mines, says he hopes the students will eventually help ease Western Australia's labour shortage.
