Drought forcing vegetable prices up
Shoppers are being warned that vegetable prices could rise by 30 per cent before Christmas, and even double in January, as the drought continues to hurt production.
But grower groups are worried that price hikes at the retail level are not being passed back to farmers, with many locked into contracts that do not recognise higher costs.
AusVeg chairman Mike Badcock says some growers have raised concerns about profiteering during the drought.
"I think while we can keep spreading the word that we'll be looking very hard at margins and the returns to growers, hopefully that keeps everybody honest. There's an opportunity here to reward growers who have done the right thing, drought proofed their farm and they do need some reward for that," he said.
The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission is reviewing prices in the meat industry as well, with a report due next week.
And it is not just the drought that is set to hurt prices.
Fruit and vegetable growers in southern Queensland are counting the cost of devastating hail storms which swept through the region late yesterday.
While up to 90 millimetres of rain was recorded in gauges on the Darling Downs, the hail has left a multi-million dollar damage bill.
Growers have reported damage to crops of cabbages, strawberries, plums, table grapes, tomatoes, mangoes and avocadoes and Stanthorpe lettuce grower Dean Radin says that could mean a price rise at the supermarket.
