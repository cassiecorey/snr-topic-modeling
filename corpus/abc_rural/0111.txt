Flooding hits northern WA town
A tropical low hovering over the east Kimberley has continued to dump huge falls of rain over the region.
Wyndham received 560 millimetres over the weekend, causing major flooding and forcing road closures.
Graeme Down from the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia says flooding in the lower Ord River is reportedly the biggest ever seen.
"The local manager for SES here advised me that he pulled his pump up to one and a half metres above what he thought was the highest he had ever seen and his pump went under again," Mr Down said.
"So I think there's been a huge volume of water that the Water Corp was telling us, before the waters had really come down out of the diversion dam that they were letting 580 cubic metres per second."
