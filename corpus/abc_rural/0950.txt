City vet students try country practice
Veterinary students in Western Australia have traded the dogs and cats of city practices for a stint on a remote cattle property in the Pilbara region.
About 1,600 kilometres from Perth, Warrawagine Station is a long way from home for two vet students, who have never done any work with cattle before.
But student Kate Louden says six weeks on 1 million acre station is a unique experience.
"I didn't realise quite how isolated the station is - 300 kilometres from the nearest shop," she said.
"We've been mustering so we've been moving the yards and drafting the cattle from different blocks.
"[We've] been up in the plane and the chopper a few times so it's been great.
