Fresh concerns raised about 3G technology in rural areas
New concerns have been raised about the future of mobile phone services in rural Australia, once the current CDMA network is phased out.
Deputy PM Mark Vaile has warned Telstra he will not accept any deterioration in services, once so-called 3G technology replaces the current system.
The system was to provide broadband Internet and other technology but Telstra says initially, the network might not be that advanced.
Telecommunications analyst Paul Budde says the 3G system will only be able to provide voice calls.
