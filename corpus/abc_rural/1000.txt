Wwoofers on the increase in Aust
Australia now has the largest number of wwoofers in the world.
The term wwoofing stands for "willing workers on organic farms" where travellers help with farmwork in exchange for food and board.
Australia has around 11,000 wwoofers working on 1,600 farms each year.
Jordyn Rettinger, a 22-year-old from Ontario in Canada says it is a great way to see the world.
