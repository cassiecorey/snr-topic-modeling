Draft chicken meat import ruling worries industry
The chicken meat industry says a decision to allow imports into Australia could pose an unnecessary risk to consumers.
In a draft import risk analysis, Biosecurity Australia recommends allowing uncooked chicken meat into the country, as long as exporting countries can prove they are free of diseases, including bird flu.
But Dr Andreas Dubs, from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, is questioning whether Australia can be certain about another country's disease status.
"That is not a simple matter," he said.
"It really comes down to the confidence that we can have with the systems in place which in the past I suppose has been shown to be somewhat questionable."
While Australian quarantine officers usually double-check disease free claims from other countries, some say that is not always a guarantee.
Peter Scott, from the Australian Veterinary Poultry Alliance, says authorities rely on getting accurate information from producers.
"Regulatory authorities can only go on the information provided to them and in some cases that may not be accurate," Mr Scott said.
"We do see overseas quite a bit of product moving through countries.
"In other words, while you believe you're getting product from a particular country it may be coming in via another country."
