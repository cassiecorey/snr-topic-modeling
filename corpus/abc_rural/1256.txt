Rural commodity price index up 2.5pc
Stronger global commodity prices are helping to offset rising interest rates and the higher value of the Australia dollar.
The Westpac-National Farmers Federation rural commodity price index for July was up 2.5 per cent on the same time last year.
The jump is being attributed to solid demand and dry seasonal conditions in the Northern Hemisphere.
Meanwhile the cotton industry is predicting prices to jump to more than $400 a bale next year due to demand from China.
