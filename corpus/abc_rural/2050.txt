Top South Korean chefs tour Australia
Imagination and talent have paid off for five of South Korea's top young chefs, who are touring Australia after winning a major culinary competition.
The chefs won the trip at the Korean equivalent of the Iron Chef competition, Meat and Livestock Australia's Black Box Culinary Challenge.
Fourteen teams had an hour to produce a four course meal from ingredients including Australian beef and lamb.
Interpreter Jinny Kim says the competition is fierce.
