Tassie cow gets leg up
The famous three-legged Tasmanian cow called Theresa is back on all fours after being fitted with a prosthetic leg this week.
Theresa broke a back leg in July when she fell down a river bank and her owner had the leg amputated.
After considerable media coverage, offers of wooden legs came from across Australia and an artificial limb maker from Launceston delivered on the challenge.
Theresa's owner, Geoff Heazlewood, says he never expected to see his heifer with a wooden leg.
"No I didn't, it was sort of one of those silly ideas that became reality I guess," he said.
