Name change for sherry, port labels
Australia's wine industry will no longer use sherry or port on their labels to try to gain better access to the European market.
Under an agreement to phase out the use of traditional European wine terms, port will become Australian tawny, while vintage port will be known as Australian vintage.
Sam Tolley from the Wine and Brandy Corporation says it will mean more freedom.
"We've been able to use this as a bargaining chip to get better access to the marketplace," he said.
