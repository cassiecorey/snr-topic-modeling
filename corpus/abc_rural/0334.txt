NZ apple growers hit back at wheat bug claims
Kiwi apple growers are angry at claims a native New Zealand wheat bug was spread to Europe by apple packaging.
Australian growers say the discovery of wheat bug in Belgium and Holland could raise new concerns about the risks posed by New Zealand apple imports.
But Peter Beaven from Pipfruit New Zealand says a study has shown the pest has a limited ability to survive cool storage.
"We don't believe for a moment it got there on apples it must have got there on some other commodity that's not cool stored or on the clothing of tourists," he said.
