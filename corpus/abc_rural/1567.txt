Wholesalers promise to fight mandatory fruit, veg code
Fruit and vegetable wholesalers say they will take legal action if forced to sign up to a mandatory code of conduct for the horticulture sector.
Prime Minister John Howard has now flagged the possibility of making the code mandatory, after fierce opposition from the Nationals and farmers to a proposed voluntary code.
Grower groups and market representatives will meet in Canberra tomorrow to debate the proposal.
But spokesman for the Central Markets Association, Andrew Young, says wholesalers will not be forced into a mandatory system.
"The wholesaling sector has continued to take the position that they wouldn't support a mandatory code, and in fact has questioned whether it would be able to be lawfully imposed upon just one sector of the industry," he said.
