Drought takes toll on small native mammals
The dry in central Australia has taken its toll on small native mammals in the West MacDonnell Ranges near Alice Springs.
An annual survey has found no central rock rats and no desert or native mice.
Glen Edwards from Parks and Wildlife says while the results are the worst in more than a decade, he is hopeful the species will re-populate.
