Decision to abandon water transport plan 'not surprising'
Residents of Western Australia's far north say they are relieved at a decision to abandon plans to transport Kimberley water to Perth.
Three options were investigated by the State Government, involving a water pipeline, a canal or transport by sea.
None have been found to be economically viable.
Kununurra resident Dick Pasfield says he is not surprised,
"I think there was a reasonable amount of scepticism about whether a project like this would actually be viable in terms of the economics," he said.
"I guess that what the report has said is basically what a lot of people thought in the first place, that it's going to cost far too much money to do a project like this."
The WA government is still on the hunt for alternate water sources, looking at options including the Yarragadee aquifer in the state's south-west.
