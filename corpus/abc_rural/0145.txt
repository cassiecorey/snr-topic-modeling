Potato growers to maintain crop production
Tasmanian potato growers have welcomed new crop contracts from the processor, Simplot and now expect to maintain crop production at recent levels.
Last year Simplot told growers there would be price and volume cuts when McDonald's awarded a major french fry contract to New Zealand growers.
But Dennis Leonard from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association says the situation has improved.
"Simplot got on their front foot and went out and chased down some new markets, which has been of benefit to a lot of growers in the State," he said.
