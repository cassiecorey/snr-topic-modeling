Fiji looks to dairying
Fiji is hoping for a boom in its dairy industry, as its dominant sugar industry faces a downturn.
A delegation has been touring dairy farms in Victoria this week to investigate alternative ways of farming.
Until recently the European Union has given preferential market treatment to Fijian sugar, but with an EU restructure, it is becoming hard for sugar growers to stay in business.
Economist with the Fijian Ministry of Agriculture Waisiici Gonemaituba thinks favourable rainfall conditions will be an advantage for dairy farmers.
"We get rain nearly every two days which is good for pasture production and the dairy industry as a whole," he said.
