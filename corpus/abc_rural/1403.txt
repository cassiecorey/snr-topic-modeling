Tasmanian farmers fear plantations' impact
Farmers in north-west Tasmania are demanding changes to state planning laws, to stop valuable farmland being converted to timber plantations.
They aired their concerns at a community meeting last night, as settlement looms on the sale of a 320 hectare property which is under contract to Great Southern Plantations.
About 170 farmers packed into the small memorial hall in the farming community of South Riana.
They are concerned for the future of the area, which has been built on successful dairy and cropping enterprises.
They are calling for the Tasmanian Government to abolish plantation development on prime agricultural land and will take their resolution to the Planning Minister next week.
The meeting comes within days of the King Island Council becoming the first in Tasmania to ban plantations on rural land, fearing they will risk the viability of dairy and beef industries.
Tasmanian Liberal Senator Richard Colbeck acknowledged there is a review under way into the tax arrangements for forestry managed investment schemes, labelled by some as the drivers of plantation expansion.
