Greens hit out at Senate inquiry rejection
The Greens are angry at the rejection of a proposed Senate inquiry into the future impact of climate change on rural communities.
The party lodged a motion in the Senate calling for an investigation into what research is being done to manage lower rainfall on farms.
The motion was defeated 33 votes to 31.
Greens Senator Rachel Siewert says CSIRO and ABARE have told the Senate that no Federal Government agencies are working on a comprehensive strategy.
