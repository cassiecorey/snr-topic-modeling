Govt abandons Paradise Dam water tender process
A new way of marketing water to irrigators in Queensland appears to have failed.
Queensland Government-owned SunWater has abandoned the tender process for the sale of water from the new Paradise Dam in southern Queensland.
The 300,000 megalitre dam, currently at just 13 per cent capacity, is west of Bundaberg on the Burnett River, but its water has attracted only limited interest from irrigators.
