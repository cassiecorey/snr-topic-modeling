ACCC to investigate Sunbeam price-setting
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will investigate whether dried fruit processor Sunbeam Foods breached the Trade Practices Act in setting low prices this season.
ACCC Commissioner John Martin held talks with growers in Mildura in north-west Victoria this week after the Victorian Farmers Federation lodged complaints of unconscionable conduct by the industry's major processor.
Growers claim Sunbeam is taking advantage of its virtual monopoly position in the industry, and has set prices at a 20-year low.
