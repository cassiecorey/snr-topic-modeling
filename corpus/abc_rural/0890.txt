Murray River levels drop
There is concern about the state of the Murray River this winter.
River Murray Water says its storages are only 40 per cent full and has reduced river flows to protect current levels.
With a lack of rain across the catchment as well, parts of the river between Mildura and Swan Hill are only waist deep.
Colignan citrus grower and river boat enthusiast Robert Mansell says the river is as low as he has seen it at this time of year.
"It's really, really interesting," he said.
