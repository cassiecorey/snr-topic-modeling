Bad roads costing states: report
A new report claims low road and transport investment is costing some states up to 12 per cent in livestock exports.
The Australian Livestock Transporters Association is debating the report on bad roads at its national conference this weekend in Canberra.
While fuel prices continue to plague the industry, the association's executive director, Luke Fraser, says gains can be also made in other areas.
"There's a limit to what the industry and perhaps even the Australian Government can do with world fuel prices, which has forced us to look more closely at things like targeted road investment," he said.
