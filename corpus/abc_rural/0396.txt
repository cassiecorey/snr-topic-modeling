Parade heralds start to mustering season
The main streets of Alice Springs are closed today to pay tribute to the local cattle industry.
The Bangtail parade celebrates the traditional start to the central Australian mustering season.
Historically the May Day weekend was when cattle from stations around Alice Springs were marched through the streets to the year's first sale.
Today there are no cattle in sight but the Alice Springs mayor will lead the parade watched by about 5,000 people as it makes its way through the centre of the town.
But while Alice Springs is a hive of activity, it is somewhat more quiet on the stations.
