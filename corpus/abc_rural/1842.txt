Authorities monitor European bluetongue virus outbreak
Australian authorities are carefully watching an outbreak of the bluetongue virus in Europe.
Bluetongue is spread by biting insects and can kill infected livestock.
Richard Norris, from Western Australia's Department of Agriculture and Food, says while the virus also exists in Australia a new strain could affect Middle East trade.
He says the latest outbreak has affected more than 700 cattle and sheep on the borders of Belgium, Holland, Germany and France.
"It's mainly affected sheep but it's also made some cattle sick and a few of them have died," Mr Norris said.
"Now this is the first time it's been recorded with credibility that cattle have been sick with a particular strain of bluetongue.
