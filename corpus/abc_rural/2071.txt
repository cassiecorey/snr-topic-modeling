Water cuts force farmers to make difficult choices
Farmers in south-west New South Wales growing grapevines and citrus trees are starting to consider which areas of their properties they will stop watering as a result of water allocation cuts.
Cheryl Rix from Western Murray Irrigation says irrigators were bracing for another cut to their water entitlements, but no one expected a 32 per cent reduction.
She says horticulturalists need to look at all the available information so they can make sound business decisions.
"I'd certainly encourage growers to really think about talking to their buyers and wineries and working out what will be will be bought next year and chase down the financial counsellors and look at the exceptional circumstances," she said.
"The Department of Primary Industries will be running some sessions starting next week to look at how we can manage water better on farm."
The state's Department of Primary Industries is sending an emergency response team to to help farmers in the Murray and Murrumbidgee regions who have had their water allocations cut.
