Corporation's decision may cost timber industry jobs
The timber industry says up to 2,000 jobs are under threat from the Australian Rail Track Corporation's decision to use concrete rather than timber sleepers to upgrade the Melbourne to Brisbane rail line.
The National Association of Forest Industries says saw mill operators were expecting to supply up to 400,000 timber sleepers a year for the next five years.
But the association's Catherine Murphy says they have now been told timber is no longer required.
"It's not just along the Murray there but it's the north coast of New South Wales and I understand sleepers are also produced in Queensland and Western Australia," she said.
"This is a specific market that many of these saw millers have invested $10 million, for example, over the past two years in upgrading their mills specifically to provide timber."
