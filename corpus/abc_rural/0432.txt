Vic juice grade apples can't find buyers
Cartons of juice grade apples are being left in Victorian packing sheds this harvest.
Growers say they are being offered an opening price of $55 a tonne, which is not enough to cover freighting and picking costs.
Beechworth grower Rob Tully says there is added frustration from city-based juice bars, which will only take a-grade fruit.
"Even the juice bars though, are very quality conscious and although they're only making juice fruit they're fairly conscious if the fruit has too many marks on it," he said.
