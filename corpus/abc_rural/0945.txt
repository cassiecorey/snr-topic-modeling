Consumers switch to Homebrand products
New figures show Homebrand products like milk, sugar and butter already account for more than 50 per cent of sales through the major supermarkets.
Frozen and canned Homebrand vegetables and dried fruits are also becoming more popular, according to research by accountancy firm KPMG.
Food processors are starting to feel the pressure, as supermarkets aim to fill one-third of their shelves with their own labels.
KPMG's Adrian Arundell says the processing sector will shrink, as other brands disappear.
"Some of them are fighting head on against it, some of them are actually working with it," he said.
