Citrus growers hoping for better orange prices
Citrus growers are hoping a fall in the production of valencia oranges will result in better prices.
The national crop is expected to fall by 25 per cent to under 200,000 tonnes due to frost damage earlier this year in South Australia and the Murray Valley.
In the Riverina region of New South Wales, production is tipped to be 90,000 tonnes, down from more than 120,000 last season.
Peter Morrish from Riverina Citrus says record prices of more than $2,500 a tonne are being paid for imported orange juice concentrate, so local growers are in a good bargaining position.
"There's discussions going on at the present time in terms of future contracts and that's looking positive on the growers' side at this stage, but unfortunately it's a wait and see," he said.
