Report highlights structural issues for Aboriginal pastoral companies
A report into the economic viability of Aboriginal pastoral companies in the Kimberley has found they are not structured to deliver sustainable profits.
The report, commissioned by Meat and Livestock Australia, surveyed a third of the 30 stations owned and operated by Aboriginal communities in north-western Australia.
Report co-author Peter McEntree says productivity is generally low and stocking rates, and land quality poor, compared to local non-Aboriginal cattle properties.
"One of the key issues and it's really a bit of a structural issue for a lot of Indigenous properties and that's just the issue of scale," he said.
