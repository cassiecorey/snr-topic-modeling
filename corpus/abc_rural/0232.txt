Centre to make sure biosecurity experts up to the job
Making sure the experts are up to scratch will be one of the tasks of a new biosecurity risk analysis centre in Victoria.
The Federal Government has commissioned the University of Melbourne to investigate how Australia assesses biosecurity threats and whether it is being done well enough.
Professor Mark Burgman says part of his job is working out the best way to keep Australia free of diseases like foot and mouth or bird flu.
"Initially our focus is biosecurity and we will develop tools to help people do that job better," he said.
