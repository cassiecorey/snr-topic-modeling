NSW Govt urged to allow graziers access to forests, national parks
The New South Wales Farmers Association wants graziers to be given access to state forests and national parks to help feed hungry livestock.
The association says feed is become scarce as the drought intensifies.
President Jock Laurie is urging the NSW Government to consider the proposal, which he says would help farmers hold onto core breeding stock.
"As far as we're concerned it would be a good tool for the feeding of core breeding stock throughout this drought period, especially when feed reserves are so low," he said.
"You don't need a long bureaucratic process to go through here, so get in and make a decision so that people can then plan well into the next few months about how they're going to feed stock."
