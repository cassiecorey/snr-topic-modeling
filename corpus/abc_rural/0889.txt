Businesses suffer as dry conditions continue
Dry conditions on pastoral properties south-east of Alice Springs have taken their toll on businesses which service the area.
It has been four years since the region has had any decent rain and stock feed is scarce.
Rodney Mingel, who runs Mingel's Heli Service, has grounded one of three helicopters this season and stood down a pilot.
He says mustering work has been halved, due to the lack of rain and lower stock numbers.
"From now on through to September is really our busy period," he said.
"There's just not much happening, I mean people have done their work, work that they normally do towards the end of the year they've done at the beginning of the year.
"Cattle numbers are down, so there's not six paddocks to muster anymore there's one.
