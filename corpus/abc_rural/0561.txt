Plan to deliver rural broadband may be dumped
Telstra has confirmed it is considering dumping a project to connect broadband Internet to thousands of country homes.
The plan involves Extel technology, which boosts the power of telephone exchanges by up to 20 kilometres.
But Telstra is concerned that rival companies will be able to use the technology.
Spokeswoman Liz Jurman says there are also other problems with the rollout of Extel and the company is now looking at alternative ways of delivering broadband to rural and remote areas.
"The extender can't be used on individual customers you need to provide it where there are clusters of demand, so obviously that depends on customer demand, so we haven't yet made a final decision on that product," she said.
"And it's important to understand this device is not the be all and end all for providing ADSL to customers.
