Defeated Mexican candidate declared 'president'
Tens of thousands of supporters of Mexico's defeated presidential candidate have declared him the president of a parallel government.
Supporters of Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador made the symbolic gesture at a huge rally in the main square of Mexico City.
The protesters are also planning to hold a swearing-in ceremony for Mr Obrador in November, just days before the inauguration of the country's official new president, Felipe Calderon.
Last week, Mexico's highest electoral court declared Mr Calderon, the conservative candidate, had won the election.
Mr Obrador says the size of today's protest shows that support for his peaceful uprising is not waning.
The rally comes on independence day, after seven weeks of peaceful protest against the election result.
