McGuigan denies grower grape prices claims
Wine giant McGuigan Simeon has denied grower claims it will not pay new grape prices set by an independent analyst.
Grower associations in the Riverland and Murray Valley claim the winery has written to growers saying it will not accept the new prices.
But chief executive Dane Hudson says there has been a misunderstanding.
