Govt rejects Goulburn Valley natural disaster calls
The Victorian Government will not be declaring the Goulburn Valley a natural disaster area.
Frosts ruined most of the area's stonefruit crops this week, with losses exceeding 300,000 tonnes.
Growers have called on the state and federal governments to declare the region a natural disaster area.
The Victorian Agriculture Minister, Bob Cameron, has rejected the call, but says exceptional circumstances applications from the area will be fast-tracked.
"When it comes to longer term arrangements, the preferable arrangement is exceptional circumstances," he said.
