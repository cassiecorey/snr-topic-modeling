Imported feed grain expected to ease shortages
The Federal Government expects the first imports of feed grain for livestock to arrive in Australia in January to ease looming shortages.
More than 40 import applications are being assessed from companies wanting to fill shortfalls caused by the drought.
Biosecurity Australia officers are making the first assessments of wheat, maize and sorghum in the UK, Canada and the UK.
But Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the imports are not likely to make a major difference in prices.
"It's a question of balance that we have a million cattle in feedlots at present and of course the dairy, pig meat and chicken industries are terribly dependent on grain," he said.
"So for those who are able to produce grain we don't want to suppress their price and in any event I don't think the amounts being able to be imported will amount to a flood."
Meanwhile the drought has forced South Australian grain marketing company ABB to accept poorer quality grain.
The company has reduced its screenings for malt barley and will accept smaller and less plump grain.
ABB's Lyndon Asser says the move will benefit growers as the company tries to secure more supply.
