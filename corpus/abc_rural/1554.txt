Commodities boom 'going strong' despite prices
The price of oil has hit a five-month low, and gold has tumbled below $US600 an ounce, but one market analyst rejects claims the commodities boom is almost over.
Rob Brierly from broking firm Hartleys says commodity prices have experienced months of volatility, and the current dramatic drop in prices is being driven by speculators.
The lower prices have dragged down the Australian sharemarket by 46 points, but Mr Brierly is confident that a correction is just around the corner.
"We might see a couple more days of weakness, or even a week of weakness but I'm sure it will turn around because the fundamentals are still very strong," he said.
"Inventories are very low for most commodities, there's not a lot of new projects coming on stream in the near term and demand from places like China is still very, very strong."
