Timbercorp branches out to compete with NZ imports
Agribusiness company Timbercorp is diversifying into the tomato business, in a bid to compete with imports.
It is to spend $25 million building Australia's biggest truss tomato glasshouse at Two Wells, north of Adelaide.
Chief executive Robert Hance says it will produce 5,000 tonnes of tomatoes for the domestic market, the same amount that is imported from New Zealand each year.
