PM's drought tour focuses on irrigation
The Prime Minister is continuing his tour of drought-affected areas of New South Wales and today the focus is on the irrigation industry.
Tonight at Finley, in the Riverina, the locals will gather to pray for rain.
But today, they are asking the John Howard for help.
On a visit to a dairy farm, Mr Howard heard that with zero water allocation, producers have been forced to pay high prices for temporary water.
That, coupled with rising costs of feed grain, is putting the squeeze on farm finances.
Mr Howard is also expected to meet with local community leaders later this afternoon.
Meanwhile, young farmers, harvesters and other farm contractors say the drought assistance package probably will not be enough to keep many of them on the land.
Western NSW crop spraying contractor, Andrew Oliver, who spoke to Mr Howard yesterday, says he and his friends are sick of watching their businesses run down.
