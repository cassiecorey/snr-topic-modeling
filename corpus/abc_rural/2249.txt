Red meat producers warned about white meat threat
Red meat producers are being warned that their biggest overseas competition might not be from traditional export rivals Brazil and the United States.
Jeff Grant, chairman of Meat and Wool New Zealand, says producers are facing a bigger threat from pork, poultry and fish.
He says consumers in developing nations are changing their diets to include more protein but white meat could become their first choice.
"That shift in terms of their diets means that for beef or milk in the dairy industry has a very good potential going forward," he said.
