Wine grower suggests pulling out cool climate vines
A respected South Australian vigneron has suggested pulling out grape vines in cool climate vineyards and putting the land to other use.
Coonawarra vigneron Ian Hollick says grape growers in cooler areas have been selling fruit at below the cost of production for the past three years, and there is no end in sight.
He does not think a proposal to compensate struggling grape growers is the way forward for the industry.
"I think its getting to the stage where we have to really bite the bullet and say that we need to remove so many thousands of hectares of cool climate grapes," he said.
