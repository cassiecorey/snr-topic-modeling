Cane smut found near Townsville
The crippling fungal disease sugar cane smut has been discovered even further north in Queensland, in the Herbert River region near Townsville.
The disease, which cuts crop yields, had been first found in the Isis and Bundaberg area in June, and more recently in the central region near Mackay.
A two kilometre quarantine zone has been imposed around the latest discovery in the Lannacost area.
Canegrowers chairman Alf Cristaudo says finding the disease in the wetter northern region had been unexpected but growers are prepared.
"We would ask everyone now to be even more vigilant than they have been, it's disappointing and a surprise that we are finding it anywhere," she said.
