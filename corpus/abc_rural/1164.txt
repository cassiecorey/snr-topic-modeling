Meat industry agreement to tackle skilled visa abuse
The Australian Meat Industry Council is trying to stamp out abuse of the program to import skilled migrants to fill labour shortages.
Unions claim some employers are breaching the rules by underpaying workers, using skilled workers to perform unskilled jobs and not providing proper training.
The Immigration Department has frozen visa applications until the concerns are addressed.
Chief executive Kevin Cottrell says a labour agreement is being negotiated to ensure all sectors stay within the law.
