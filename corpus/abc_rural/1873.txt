South-west NSW residents pray for rain
Residents of south-west New South Wales have turned to prayer to break the drought.
Farmers and town folk have been united at ecumenical church services.
More than 100 people came together in Wagga to call for rain, while another inter-faith prayer service took place in Leeton.
Pastor Michael Skewes says aside from the spiritual value of prayer, it was a strong show of support for those on the land.
"I think for the farmers that were here - we saw a number of hands go up and say 'yeah, we're farmers' - for them to know that the Wagga community, we in the city really do care for what they're going through I think that's got enormous value as well," he said.

Over the past 50 years, some station rainfall has increased by up to 300 millimetres.
Climatologist Sam Cleland says rainfall in parts of the Victoria River district and Kimberley is increasing by 50 millimetres per decade
"It's potentially that it's not a direct result of greenhouse gases," he said.
