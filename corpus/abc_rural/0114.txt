Farmers set to show off produce
Preparations are well under way for this year's Sydney Royal Easter Show.
And farmers on the state's far south cost are getting ready to show off their produce, including Noel Watson, from Bega.
He is picking giant pumpkins and says it takes more manpower than you might think.
"More than we got here. I'll be bringing the tractor down here directly to pick it up, I think that one up there is probably the biggest I have grown, it could be pulling 200 kilos," he said.
