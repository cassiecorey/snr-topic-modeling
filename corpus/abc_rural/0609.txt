GG foreshadows future outback tours
After a fortnight sleeping in his swag, the Governor-General has called for all future governors-general to take annual tours of the outback.
Over the past two weeks, Major General Michael Jeffrey has covered thousands of kilometres from the Birdsville track to Western Australia's Tanami Desert, trying to bridge the divide between city and country.
Major General Jeffrey hopes an annual event could showcase the positives of rural life.
"And I'd hope to persuade my successors to do the same things, so it becomes part and parcel of the Governor-General's role to be out there in the bush, be seen to be in the bush and to be seen to be saying well done folks," he said.
