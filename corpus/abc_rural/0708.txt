Tough season ahead for WA sheep producers
Western Australian sheep producers are being urged to buckle up for a tough season.
There is no green feed in the southern half of the state, apart from extreme lower west and south coastal areas, and no rain in sight.
Livestock numbers at saleyards are rising as farmers destock bare paddocks.
Sheep management consultant Andrew Ritchie says graziers need to move soon.
"We have to take it on board mentally first that it is now a poor season and has been a poor season for at least two weeks," he said.
