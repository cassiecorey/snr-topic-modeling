Plan unveiled to secure veg industry future
A new $3 million strategy to secure the future of the vegetable industry has been unveiled in Brisbane this morning.
VegVision 2020 is the product of months of talks between growers, the Federal Government, supermarkets and food processors.
It is a $3 million plan with a very simple message - how to lift the industry's growth from an unsustainable 3 per cent by getting more vegetables on consumers' plates.
Fair Dinkum Food Campaigner Richard Bovill is a member of the Australian Vegetable Industry Development Group and says growers must work with retailers and processors if they are to secure their future.
"There are adversarial issues out there, there will always be competitive pressures but we also have to understand our common goals and work together with those," he said.
"I think we can look to a range of different industry models and we shouldn't just look at vegetables and the horticultural sector."
