Rockmelon prices increase
Rockmelon growers in Western Australia's Ord Valley have received prices that are up to 10 per cent higher this year.
Rockmelons are the biggest horticulture crop grown in the region, worth $7 million a year.
Grower David Menzell says the first price rise in 10 years is largely due to a shrinking number of growers across northern Australia.
But transport woes continue to plague growers, who are competing with other crops for trucks.
"Our major issue is that Perth is a relatively small market but that's where the transport was available so a lot of fruit went to Perth that would probably wouldn't have if we had other options and depressed prices there," Mr Menzell said.
