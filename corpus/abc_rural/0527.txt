Tasmania set for rail upgrade
Toll's successful takeover of transport company Patrick has paved the way for a multi-million dollar rail upgrade in Tasmania.
Pacific National, which is jointly owned by the two companies, threatened to stop carting container freight by rail last year, unless state and federal governments helped to improve infrastructure.
After months of stalled negotiations, Pacific National has now agreed to invest $38 million in new rolling stock, while the governments will provide $118 million for infrastructure.
Tasmanian Minister for Infrastructure Jim Cox hopes industry will also support a better rail service.
