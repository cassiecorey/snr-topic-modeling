Vic farmers hit out at drought assistance package
Farmers have reacted angrily to the Victorian Government's drought assistance package, announced yesterday, saying they have missed out once again.
Much of the $12.5 million package focuses on assistance for communities.
Assistance for farmers includes mental health services and counselling, business support and farming advice.
Goulburn Valley dairy farmer Dudley Bryant says the days are numbered for farmers unless they get some financial help immediately.
"I think they're treating us like idiots," he said.
"They think that we need social workers running around here patting us on the back and telling us that everything is going to be all right.
"And they've missed the real point, [which] is that farmers and rural communities can look after themselves.
