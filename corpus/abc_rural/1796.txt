Cyclone warning for Top End residents
Residents living the Northern Territory's Top End region are being urged to take preparations for the coming cyclone season very seriously.
CSIRO surveys have shown tropical cyclone Monica, which hit the Arnhem Land coast in April, devastated a wider area and more vegetation, and brought stronger winds than cyclone Tracy, which flattened Darwin in 1974.
Researcher Dr Gary Cook says Monica snapped off trees at the trunk up to 40 kilometres inland.
"The cyclone went past and did a lot of damage in Maningrida, but in the bush there was only about 15 per cent of the trees were snapped off or toppled over," Dr Cook said.
"Whereas out where cyclone Monica crossed the coast was closer to 80 per cent that compares to cyclone Tracy with Darwin, where it was only about one third of eucalyptus trees in town were toppled over with cyclone Tracy.
