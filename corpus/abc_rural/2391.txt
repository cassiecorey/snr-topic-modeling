Cattle ID scheme issues being resolved: NLIS chairman
The chairman of the National Livestock Identification Scheme (NLIS) for cattle says problems with the scheme are being addressed.
A leaked copy of an audit of the scheme, commissioned by the federal Agriculture Minister, has highlighted problems with farmer cooperation, scrutiny of the system and different levels of state compliance.
Chairman John Wyld says the NLIS is working well overall, but admits there are weaknesses, including the lack of a back-up plan if Telstra's systems supporting the database go down.
"Our contract with Telstra requires a full disaster recovery plan," he said.
"Now I'm aware there is an ongoing issue between MLA and Telstra, but it's really a matter that Telstra's not been able to comply with but it's part of our contract.
