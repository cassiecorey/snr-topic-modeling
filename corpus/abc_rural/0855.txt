Grain farmers' future looks bleak
Many Victorian grain farmers are still very depressed about the outlook for the season.
In western Victoria, the local water authority, Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water, says the winter channel run may even have to be cancelled for rural home dams because they are only 6 per cent full, the lowest level ever recorded for this time of year.
Grain and sheep farmer Bernard Gross from Drung Drung says if winter rainfall does not return to normal, the future will be bleak.
"My family have been here since 1873. But I have been told that the early 1900s were also particularly dry," Mr Gross said.
