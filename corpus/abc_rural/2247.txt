Calf sales held early
The drought has forced Victoria's annual new year weaner calf sales to be held earlier than usual.
The sales usually allow breeders to present their best beef cattle to buyers from across Victoria and New South Wales.
More than 2,000 cattle were sold in Wangaratta on Friday, with a pen of 20 angus steers making the top price of $460 each.
Farmers say they were pleasantly surprised with prices paid.
Robin Gibb from Milawa says the bigger steers made over $400 and the smaller draft sold for just under.
"They are better than I expected on the day and the conditions actually," he said.
Graham Batten from Moyhu sold two pens of steers and says he is "more than happy".
