Truck drivers 'living below poverty line'
New research shows the families of truck drivers are suffering from record fuel prices, drought and long working hours.
More than 70 per cent of the nation's transport fleet is made up of small operators and the report by the Transport Women of Australia Association says tough times are being felt everywhere.
Spokeswoman Pam McMillan says the study backs up anecdotal evidence.
"We did find that some operators are living below the poverty line and more than what we would like to consider," she said.
"They might have a nice house but perhaps can't afford to buy decent groceries every week and it's not that they're being frivolous, it's just that the money's not out there.
