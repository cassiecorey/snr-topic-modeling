Commissioner to investigate bushfire practices
Concerns about bushfire prevention and recovery measures in Victoria will be investigated by the state's emergency services commissioner.
Commissioner Bruce Esplin has been meeting with farmers and other groups, who believe not enough fuel reduction burns were done before the Grampians bushfires in January.
Mr Esplin says the report will assess what progress has been made since his report on the 2003 Alpine fires.
"I made a lot of recommendations in that report, 148 recommendations in fact, and I think it's time that we put out a report to the community about what's happened, what's the progress on each of those recommendations, " Mr Esplin said.
