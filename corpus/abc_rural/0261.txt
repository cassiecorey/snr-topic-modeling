Little central Aust critter becoming a popular pet
It might not be the Easter bunny but a little critter from central Australia is proving a hit in the Top End.
The spinifex hopping mouse has become a popular pet in Katherine.
And as vet Sam McMahon explains, you cannot cuddle them, but with their big eyes, kangaroo legs, and basil brush tail, they are great to watch.
"They're a very interesting pet, they can live quite happily in you know a reasonable sort of set up," he said.
"And they're very interesting to watch. They dig holes, they dig tunnels, they bound around, they're quite interesting to sort of sit there and stare at.
