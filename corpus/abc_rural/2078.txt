Banks struggle to meet country demand for managers
The big banks say they are finding it hard to attract branch managers to country towns.
Most of the banks say they have doubled and tripled staff numbers in rural areas after the closure of hundreds of branches during the 1990s.
Rabobank has doubled its rural presence to 46 regional offices and employed an extra 140 staff.
Westpac has employed an extra 80 people nationally this year and doubled the size of its graduate program.
The National Australia Bank (NAB) has employed an extra 120 people in its agribusiness unit over last two years.
NAB spokesman Wayne Carlson says the company has had to offer 'sweeteners' to lure more bank managers.
