Milk tankers help out firefighting effort
Dairy processor Murray Goulburn has come to the aid of Victorian firefighters who are battling blazes in hot and windy conditions today.
Milk tankers are being filled with water and taken to the fire front for the Country Fire Authority.
Brad Stokel from Murray Goulburn says the tankers will be used for as long as they are needed.
"We've got tankers available and we put those in the locations that they request," he said.
