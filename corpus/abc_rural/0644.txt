Lettuce aphids found in SA
The currant lettuce aphid has been found in South Australia for the first time.
Authorities have detected the pest on properties in the Adelaide Hills and the northern Adelaide Plains.
The aphid was found in Victoria last year and has plagued lettuce crops in Tasmania since 2004.
Originally, South Australia banned imports of interstate lettuce to protect the industry, but this has now been removed.
