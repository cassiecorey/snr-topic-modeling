Livestock prices lower in WA
A new report in Western Australia has shown significant differences in livestock prices between the eastern states and the west.
The Department of Agriculture report says saleyard prices for all stock classes except porkers are well below those on the eastern seaboard.
Trade steer prices were 14 per cent lower and export lambs 16 per cent lower between March 2003 and September this year.
Tim D'arcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says it is a dramatic difference.
"It probably averages 50 cents a kilo year in and year out, but it varies anywhere between about 20 or 30 cents up to $1.28 a kilo and we're always that far behind," he said.
