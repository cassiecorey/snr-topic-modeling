Wild rivers legislation will hamper development: groups
Graziers and Indigenous leaders on the Cape York Peninsula say future development of the region will be stifled by the Queensland Government's new wild rivers legislation.
The draft policy aims to protect 19 of the state's pristine river catchments, by introducing restrictions on agriculture, aquaculture and grazing.
Head of the Cape York Institute, Noel Pearson, says pastoralists and traditional landowners need to work together to fight the policy and environmentalists.
"We find ourselves in a position where the Greens no longer respect the fact people need economic development and the cattle industry in this region, and they've been winning," Mr Pearson said.
