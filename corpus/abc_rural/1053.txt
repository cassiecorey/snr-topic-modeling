AWEX in backflip on auction room decision
Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) has reversed its decision to give up its auction rooms in Sydney and Melbourne.
AWEX had wanted wool brokers to take over the Yennora and Brooklyn sites by the end of the year.
The move was not supported by exporters or Sydney-based brokers, but Melbourne broker Don Fraser says it was vital to keep the auction rooms open.
"Our focus is on ensuring that our clients have a continuous selling arrangement for their wool," he said.
"Should AWEX have decided not to go ahead, we would then have taken the lease back after all the brokers did set up 691 Geelong Road.
"The arrangement will be as it has been in the past, which is a one year lease with a one year option."
