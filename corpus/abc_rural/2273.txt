Labor senator predicted to take agriculture post
Labor's outgoing agriculture spokesman expects Tasmanian Senator Kerry O'Brien to be the frontrunner for the portfolio.
Gavan O'Connor has agreed to step down after the appointment of Kevin Rudd to the party leadership.
A frontbench ballot will be held tomorrow and Mr O'Connor says there are several candidates with experience in agriculture.
"Senator O'Brien has been a participant in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Committee over a long period of time and knows many of the key players in the industry and others," he said.
