Plantation trees may contribute to greenhouse gas levels
New research suggests plantation trees could actually contribute to greenhouse gas levels rather than lower them.
A report in the international science journal Nature says the trees emit methane.
It was previously thought methane emissions from plants came from areas where oxygen was limited, like rice paddies.
Research scientist Philip Polglase says while the finding was totally unexpected, it is not necessarily alarming.
"What we in Ensis have done recently is compare expected rates of methane release from tree plantations with the rates of carbon uptakes," he said.
"The amount of methane released is only a very small amount or the carbon equivalent taken up. We think it's about less than 5 per cent.
