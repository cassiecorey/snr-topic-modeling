Kulukuk farm mud crab trial breeds success
A Darwin Aboriginal community has succeeded in growing out its first farmed mud crabs, as part of a commercial trial.
So far 600 crabs weighing an average of 350 grams have been sold to wholesalers.
The trial is part of a Commonwealth Government Shared Responsibility Agreement.
The Kululuk farm employs eight people, including traditional owner Jacqueline Treves.
"We seem to be one of the first people in Darwin to grow our own mud crab farm," she said.
"Now that we have got one, we just want to make it work for us and our children.
"It's important because we want good jobs for younger Indigenous people and for our own children.
