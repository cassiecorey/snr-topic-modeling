Uncontracted winegrape growers may be in demand
Uncontracted winegrape growers might have more luck selling their fruit this year.
A lack of water and frost damage in some parts of Australia means that remaining grapes are likely to be in demand.
Mike Stone from Murray Valley Winegrowers in Victoria says preliminary figures show the coming harvest could be several hundred thousand tonnes down on last season.
"Already we have heard of some offers for cabernet sauvignon and merlot of around $400 a tonne, so there is evidence of more interest," he said.
