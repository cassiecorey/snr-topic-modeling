Japan worried about milk supply during drought
Research and development organisation Dairy Australia says milk may have to be redirected from new overseas markets to maintain supplies to Japan.
Managing director Mike Ginnivan has just returned from the country, where he met buyers worried about the drought's impact on the supply of Australian milk.
Japan receives 20 per cent of Australia's dairy exports and is seen as one of our strongest buyers.
Mr Ginnivan says other Asian markets may have to be sacrificed.
"China is a very difficult market - it's a short term market," he said.
