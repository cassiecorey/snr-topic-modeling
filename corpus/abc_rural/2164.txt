ABARE chief to take on climate change role
The nation's new chief commodity forecaster says predicting the effect of climate change on agriculture will have to become part of his work.
Phillip Glyde has been appointed executive director of the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) after working in the Departments of Prime Minister, Industry and Agriculture.
He says the agency needs to be responsive to industry and farmer needs but says providing economic analysis on climate change will be difficult.
"I think it is something that we will be doing more on, I hesitate to say when," he said.
"Really the issue there is the quality of the science and really the economic analysis flows from the science.
"One of the problems we've got at the moment is that impacts of climate change at a regional level or on a particular industry aren't really that well known."
Meanwhile grain farmers are being urged to factor in climate change when planning for the future.
Dr Peter Hayman from the South Australian Research and Development Institute has won a 'Seed of Light' award from the Grains Research and Development Corporation for his efforts to make farmers aware of climate change.
He says many grain growers are now wondering how to adapt.
"Certainly, no longer are people saying - what is climate change, is this something my grandchildren have to worry about?" he said.
"They're concerned about it and wanting to know more information about it now and what it means for their decision-making and planning.
