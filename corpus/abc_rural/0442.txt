Primary producers frustrated at lack of harvest labour support
Primary producers in Western Australia are disappointed at missing out on harvest labour support.
The Federal Government will fund services in 16 harvest areas across Australia, but says tenders from the west were not up to scratch.
The services help to match the pool of workers with seasonal job vacancies.
David McKerrell from the Kimberley Primary Industries Association says it is frustrating funds have not made it to all regions
"It needs to be recognised that there are production areas right across Australia that have a requirement for harvest labour and all areas should be given opportunity to take part in those sort of schemes," he said.
