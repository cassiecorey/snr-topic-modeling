NZ growers question Australian fire blight detection skills
New Zealand apple growers have questioned the ability of Australian quarantine workers to inspect their orchards for the plant disease fire blight.
Inspections would be carried out as part of new regulations to allow New Zealand apple imports into Australia.
Submissions on the draft regulations close next week.
But Pipfruit New Zealand's Peter Beaven says Australia does not have the skills to detect fire blight.
"The draft contemplates AQIS inspectors coming out to New Zealand and doing work that I don't think they are qualified to do, quite frankly, because you know they are going to be looking around orchards, looking for canker and so forth and they've got no experience in doing that," he said.
