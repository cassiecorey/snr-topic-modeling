Weed killers suspended because of crop damage
Authorities have suspended the use of 24 weed killers due to concern about the damage they are causing to horticulture crops.
Known as 2,4-D short chain esters, the chemicals are most commonly used to kill weeds in grain crops.
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority says despite control measures to stop spray drift, the chemicals can still evaporate and travel long distances.
Pesticides program manager Eva Bennett Jenkins says chemical companies will need to prove their products are safe but until then the horticulture sector needs to be protected.
