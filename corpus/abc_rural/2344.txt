Administrator looks into Co-op's finances
The administrator of a fruit growers' cooperative in southern New South Wales has told grower creditors that they will only get around a quarter of their money back.
The Young District Producers' Cooperative Society, which processed dried fruit, went into voluntary administration with outstanding debts of about $2.6 million.
Administrator Steve Parbery says there are also concerns the Co-op may have been trading while insolvent.
"The question mark arises as to why the Co-op ended up in this position and it would appear that the accounting that was done prior to June 06," he said.
