Fishing industry disappointed by orange roughy decision
Tasmania's fishing industry is disappointed by a decision to list the orange roughy as endangered.
It is the first commercially caught species to be listed.
The fishing industry had been preparing for their catch quotas to be slashed to allow stock levels to recover but were not expecting a complete ban.
Neil Stump from the Tasmanian Fishing Industry Council says the decision makes the future of the fishery uncertain.
"I only heard about it yesterday so I haven't had the opportunity to evaluate the potential ramifications but I think it's the unknown, what does this actually mean for us?" he said.
The Federal Government has moved to establish a national standard for biodiesel.
Environment Minister Ian Campbell plans to have a quality standard for blended fuels within months.
John Keniry from the Australian Biodiesel Group says the standard is needed to give consumers confidence that biodiesel will not damage engines.
But he says more government incentives are needed as well.
"In the US for example, there's a blender's credit and in Europe, in effect, a lot of the countries mandating that diesel [say it] has to contain a certain amount of biodiesel," he said.
