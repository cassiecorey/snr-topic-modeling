Animal rights group targets children in education campaign
An animal rights group has announced plans to target 3 million children in 9,000 schools with a program it says teaches compassion and respect for animals.
Voiceless has launched its Animal Club project on the Internet, encouraging children to speak out against factory farming, live exports, and kangaroo culling.
Education Manager Elaine Morris, says it is the first national animal education initiative for children.
"All Animal Club really wants to do is just provide children with the opportunity to harness that natural empathy that most children have for animals, and look at them through a child's eyes," she said.
