Dam to house turtle hatchery
The new Paradise Dam in south-east Queensland is soon to be the home of a world-first turtle hatchery.
Concerns were raised over the future of the endangered elseya turtle during construction of the dam on the Burnett River, south-west of Bundaberg.
But the new hatchery is designed to restore turtle numbers, with thousands of baby hatchlings expected to be released over the next five years.
Craig Thamm from the Burnett Dam Alliance says attacks on eggs and hatchlings by predators is the single biggest risk to the turtle's future.
"Particularly your feral predators such as foxes and pigs are [preying on] the eggs and you're getting very few, if any hatchlings back into the river," he said.
