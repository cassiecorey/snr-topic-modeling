Sugar cane smut found on third cane farm
A third Mackay cane farm has been found to have sugar cane smut, confirming fears that the fungal disease is widespread.
The disease has been found on a property, 20 kilometres from the original find near Mackay, which had been discovered on Melbourne Cup day.
Mackay Area Productivity Service spokesman Alan Royal says smut now looks to be well-established in central Queensland.
"It's very, very sad but it's right across the other side of town and the whips were reasonably advanced but they're certainly not big whips like we've been seeing," he said.
"What did frighten me was on the weekend in one row at the initial farm, you know we were seeing whips that were four, five feet long, so it's got a hold there but let's hope we can get on top of it."
Meanwhile sugar cane farmers in Western Australia's Ord Valley are looking for new varieties, because some which were once resistant to cane smut are not any more.
The disease was first found in WA's north-west in 1998.
CJ Ord River Sugar spokesman Wayne Paul says 100 varieties have been tried in the past five years but only a handful have shown promise.
He says smut is also expected to reduce next year's crop.
"Q95 is probably the worst. It's getting a bit of smut now whereas it didn't have earlier on, so that will probably be mostly ploughed out over the next couple of years," he said.
