Deadline for potential wheat exporters looms
The Federal Government wants potential wheat exporters to submit their applications by Friday, to give certainty to grain growers during the harvest.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran now has the power of veto over export applications, after its removal from AWB in the wake of the Cole inquiry.
Mr McGauran says applications will be assessed on public interest grounds to maximise returns to the industry.
