MLA defends red meat campaign in light of breast cancer research
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is defending its campaign encouraging people to eat more red meat, despite new US research suggesting it can cause an increased risk of breast cancer.
Harvard University surveyed 90,000 women between the ages of 26 and 46 over 12 years.
The university says the results showed there was an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly from the regular consumption of processed meats.
But MLA's general marketing manager David Thomason says the "eat red meat" campaign is also based on scientific research.
"We don't discount any research," he said.
"I mean it's important in nutrition research to see it in context.
