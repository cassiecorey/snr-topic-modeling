PM's news an 'enormous relief' in rural Aust
There has been a largely warm response to Prime Minister John Howard's decision to stay on and fight the next federal election.
Mr Howard announced yesterday that he would not be handing over the top job to Treasurer Peter Costello.
Mark Patterson, from Currie Communications, expects country Australia to be happy with the move, which should increase the chances of another Coalition victory.
