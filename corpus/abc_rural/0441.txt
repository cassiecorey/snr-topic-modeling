Beef program adds to producer returns
A new economic analysis has found the beef quality program MSA is adding an extra 20 cents a kilo to beef producers' returns.
The meat standard was developed by the Beef Cooperative Research Centre and uses a set of scientific criteria to allow consumers to identify beef which is guaranteed to be tender.
Centre head Dr Heather Burrow says the program will add $85 million to beef revenue this financial year.
Overall, she says it has generated three times what it cost to industry to develop.
"Averaging 20 cents a kilo, beef producers, retailers and processors are getting a premium for beef that they can guarantee is better than every day eating quality," she said.
The Bureau of Statistics will conduct a census of livestock producers for the first time in five years.
It will collect data from 190,000 farms across the country and is expected to highlight the value of the cattle industry to the Australian economy.
Census manager, Jim Williamson says the data will help to drive the live export industry.
"Being able to ensure we can meet future export markets if we want to enter into future contracts, we can be confident we have enough cattle to fill the contracts," he said.
"People can keep a handle on whether the cattle herd is going up or down."
