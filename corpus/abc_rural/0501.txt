Seafood lovers to feel the pinch on crab prices
Commercial crab fishermen in the Northern Territory say they are potting just over half the number of crabs they used to, because of new catch size rules.
The minimum catch size of both female and male mud crabs has increased by a centimetre, but anglers say there are not many around at this time of year.
Melbourne seafood wholesaler, Spencer Wilkinson says diners could be wrestling bigger crabs on the dinner plate in the future, if they can afford them.
"It will just price itself out of the market and what happens is, when it gets to exorbitant levels, the Sydney market soaks up basically all the crab," he said.
