Infrastructure costs hold up Ord irrigation scheme
Infrastructure costs are the latest hurdle for expansion plans in the nation's biggest irrigation scheme, in Western Australia's far north.
Native title settlement last October raised hopes of a quick go-ahead for Ord Stage 2 but six months on there is still no movement.
The scheme would more than double the existing irrigation area in WA, with more than 30,000 hectares earmarked for development.
WA's Minister for Agriculture and Food Kim Chance says a decision is imminent, but it is a matter of deciding how much should be paid for roads, power and irrigation works.
