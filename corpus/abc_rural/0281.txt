Canada records 5th mad cow case
Canada has confirmed its fifth case of mad cow disease.
But it is unlikely to cause further trade restrictions with the United States.
US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says he expects no change in imports of Canadian beef and cattle under 30 months, after mad cow disease showed up in a six-year-old British Columbia dairy cow.
But Greg Doud, with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, says based on the cow's age there is a concern over the effectiveness of Canada's ban on feeding cow parts to cows, thought to spread the disease.
"Having the second animal that seems to be after the feed ban went into place in August of 1997... does seem to suggest that there is a feed ban compliance issue," he said.
The US resumed imports of younger Canadian animals and their meat last year, but still prohibits trade in older ones.
