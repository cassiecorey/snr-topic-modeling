Wagyu property on market for $110m
A unique beef property in the mid-west of Western Australia has hit the market with a price tag of $110 million.
The 30,000-hectare property includes 20,000 head of the elite breed of Wagyu beef.
Selling agent John Garland says the asking price is strong, despite the dry conditions that have been felt across much of WA this year.
"We're not seeing any fall back in prices at all," he said.
"If anything, one can say its been a constant, contained firming of values.
"Certainly there's a premium involved in the culmination of the cattle and land here.
"The price at what we only say is around two and half thousand a hectare in general terms is justified, if with it, goes the herd of 20,000 Wagyu head of cattle."
Meanwhile, one of Australia's most famous cattle station resorts has shed its interest in livestock.
El Questro, in northern Western Australia, was sold to an international tourism group for $17 million earlier this year.
The Voyages, Hotels and Resorts Group has sold its 5,000 head of cattle, and agisted the property's 404,000 hectares.
Spokesman David Hedges says the decision will allow the company to focus on its core business.
