New licences to double SA oil, gas exploration area
The area under exploration for new oil and gas deposits in South Australia will double, after the approval of eight new exploration licences.
The exploration area will increase to 140,000 square kilometres, including the Arckaringa Basin near Coober Pedy in the far north.
The company SAPEX has been awarded the licences and managing director Andrew Andrejewskis says any finds will help other mining projects.
"We're looking at the major resource projects that are occurring in that general vicinity," he said
