Winemakers group downgrades vintage estimates
The Winemakers Federation has downgraded this season's vintage estimates by 79,000 tonnes.
Australia's total tonnage has fallen to 1.486 million tonnes, slightly down on last year.
Chief executive Stephen Strachan says early figures released last month did not take into account the amount of fruit that would not be harvested.
"The vintage came in at about 4 per cent down on last year's record level," he said.
"You'd probably recall that we've had two record season's in a row, given that there's been quite a significant surplus in place in the industry I think everyone was hopeful we'd have a vintage that was a bit lower this year and it has been.
That said though there's been a lot of fruit left on the vine or worked into the ground and had that all been processed we probably would have had another record this year."
Meanwhile the national wine grape grower body will put forward plans for a $60 million revival package at an industry summit in Melbourne on Friday.
Mark Mckenzie from Wine Grape Growers Australia says the proposal would take at least 600,000 tonnes of grapes out of production over the next two years, to ease the industry oversupply.
Mr McKenzie says the money could be generated by levies, and used to pay growers to put their vineyards into hibernation.
"Effectively it's 15,000 hectares at $2,000 so we're talking about $30 million a year each year for two years - a $60 million package," he said.
