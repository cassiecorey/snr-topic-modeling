Aust Farm Institute urges drought policy reform
The latest conclusions on drought policy reform, prepared for the Australian Farm Institute, say farmers should be encouraged to be better prepared for drought and governments need a major overhaul of how financial assistance is provided.
Several experts have prepared papers for the Institute and most agree that current drought policy is too focused on crisis management.
Financial adviser Rob Brown argues the policies penalise farmers who run their business in ways to cope with drought.
"If you have prepared, in fact if you've done the things that are the objectives of the drought policy, then you won't be eligible," he said.
And while there is a belief that government policy can actually worsen the wellbeing of farmers and waste resources, others say that fewer farmers are asking for help because of better farm management.
Linda Botterill from the University of NSW believes an income based loan scheme would be simpler and more effective at helping farmers through drought, and be less of a knee-jerk reaction from government.
