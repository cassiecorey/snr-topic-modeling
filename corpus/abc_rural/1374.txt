Grain delivery rules anger WA farmers
Some West Australian farmers are angry at new rules imposed by grain handler CBH for delivering grain this season.
Under the changes, farmers who overload grain trucks will have to forfeit the extra grain, with the proceeds going to local shires for road maintenance.
Farmers like Peter Boyle from York are upset because the scheme could involve extra costs.
"What they're aiming to achieve is certainly a lot better than what Main Roads is trying to do and it's better than what's in the eastern states," he said.
"I commend them for that.
"But some of the other hidden charges that they're bringing forth, that really is a bit of a stab in the back."
