Fuel prices set to rise
Fuel prices are set to hit last year's record highs.
The price of both petrol and diesel is up in many parts of the country, blamed on the rising price of crude oil and the falling value of the dollar.
But Geoff Trotter from Fuel Track says traditionally fuel prices are at their highest at Easter and it is not good news this year.
