Farmers dispute Govt report figures
Vegetable growers say the Federal Government has made up figures in a report, which shows extended country of origin food labelling would cost consumers $120 million a year.
Farmers want the labels on packaged and canned food as well as fresh produce to give consumers more information and promote locally grown fruit and vegetables.
But the Government says the study shows the costs of the changes would far outweigh the benefits for both consumers and growers.
John Roach from grower group AusVeg says the study was based on flawed data.
But while rejecting new laws to enforce more detailed labels, Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says he wants to change the Trade Practices Act to give consumers more accurate information.
He says under the changes, 'made in Australia' would be replaced for some packaged food to 'grown in Australia'.
