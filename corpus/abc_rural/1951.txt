Land rights anniversary commemorated
The anniversary of land rights in South Australia has been commemorated in the state's far north-west.
The Pitjantjatjara people were given freehold title to 103 square kilometres under an agreement with the State Government in 1981.
It was the first deal of its type in Australia.
State Aboriginal Affairs Minister Jay Weatherill say the anniversary comes at a time when governments need to rethink their approach to Aboriginal communities.
"This is the first place in Australia that gave freehold title to a community so it's a very important occasion," he said.
