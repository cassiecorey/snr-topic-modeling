Livestock prices slump
Sheep and cattle prices have slumped across the nation, as farmers offload stock they cannot feed.
Sheep have lost nearly 75 per cent of their value in the past four weeks.
Yardings in all states have increased substantially, with the southern states hit hardest.
Travis Parsci, from the National Livestock Reporting Service, says the falls are drastic.
"In the last fortnight we've probably seen 20 to 30 cents shaved off a lot of average prices. We have seen a lot of the plainer grades suffering even larger falls," he said.
"It's been caused by the large number of cattle coming onto the market, as everyone's aware, by the dry condtions, the lack of water in particular and also a lack of feed that a lot of producers are faced with at the moment."
The drought is also pushing wool prices up.
News of Australia's plight is prompting wool buyers to stock up for fear that supplies will run out.
The southern market indicator rose by up to 18 cents at last week's national sales, the biggest weekly rise since January.
Tony Kidman from Quality Wool in south Australia, says buyers also want to avoid buying drought-effected wool, which is less strong than other wool.
