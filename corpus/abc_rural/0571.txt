Weaker price for Indian wheat deal
Despite a boom in wheat futures and the lowest global wheat stocks in 25 years, Australian farmers are not getting top grain prices this season.
In the latest deal, Australia is believed to have offered to sell wheat to India at a much lower price than its major competitors.
Grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says that is largely due to the practise of selling each year's stocks, before the next season's harvest.
"While it may be tempting to hold wheat back against this rising market and achieve higher prices later in the year, the practise in Australia has really been to clear each crop before the next one comes in basically at whatever price," he said.
"The storage and handling companies and growers get pretty cranky if we go into the next harvest with stocks still being held in the system and I guess if AWB think that to get rid of the wheat they need to push it out at lower prices, then that's what they're doing."
