Industry levy vote for dairy farmers
Dairy Australia is calling for farmers to increase their support for research and development when an industry levy is put to the vote early next year.
Many farmers have voiced disappointment with the performance of the peak industry body at recent meetings to discuss the levy.
Dairy Australia's John McKew says the organisation needs to communicate better, but says its vital investment continues.
"I would suggest that some of the concerns have been that there is probably a lack of understanding or appreciation from a large number of dairy farmers about where their dairy service levy is invested from Dairy Australia," he said.
