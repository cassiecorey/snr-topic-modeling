Organised crime targeted by fishing Bill
Organised crime in the fishing industry will be targeted by tough new penalties if the State Government's Fisheries Management Bill becomes law. A recent study by the Australian Institute of Criminology has revealed organised criminal activity in the industry with syndicates operating across state boundaries. South Australia's director of Fisheries Will Zacharin says this is one of the reasons why tougher penalties for illegal fishing have been included in the Bill which was introduced to Parliament last week. Mr Zacharin says it also includes a demerit points system for commercial licence holders.
