Lower cotton production forecast
The United States Department of Agriculture is predicting higher demand and lower production of cotton around the world over the next 12 months.
That could result in better prices for Australian cotton growers, with global stocks forecast to be down 1.5 million bales by the end of July next year.
Australian farmers are about to start planting their next crop, but Cliff White from Queensland Cotton says they still need to be cautious.
"[The] next few weeks is relatively crucial as the northern hemisphere crop comes off," he said.
"The big players of the US, China, and India ... what happens there will very much determine how the price goes, but with the numbers that we have just gone through, that draw down in stock, there is a little bit more potential than we have seen in the last marketing year."
