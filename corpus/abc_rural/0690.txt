Barraba residents cautiously welcome mining company plans
Residents at Barraba, in the north-west of New South Wales, have cautiously welcomed a mining company's plans to extract minerals from the old Woodsreef asbestos mine.
The Sydney-based International Minerals Corporation has been granted an exploration licence worth hundreds of millions of dollars, which could involve a new magnesium metal and silica production plant at the mine.
The site near the town was abandoned in 1983.
Former mayor Shirley Close hopes the deal will go ahead, bringing up to 100 new jobs to the region.
