Coles Myer planning to double homebrand range
Coles Myer says farmers should not fear the growth of generic homebrand lines.
The company, which owns the Coles and Bi-Lo supermarket chains, is planning to double its homebrand range to 2,000 products within the next few years.
Many fruit and vegetable growers are worried that the supermarket giant will buy low-quality, cheap imports to fill the range.
But group quality manager Jackie Healing says the move should be looked at as more of an opportunity than a threat.
"This is northing to be worried about," she said.
"The growth of house brand is a fantastic mechanism for driving quality and customer satisfaction, growing sales and increasing loyalty to the Australian market.
