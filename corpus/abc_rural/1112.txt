Dairy co-ops increase returns to farmers
New South Wales regional dairy cooperatives have bucked the trend of the major milk processors by increasing returns to farmers this season.
Norco and the Bega Cooperative on the north and south coasts have announced step-ups in their milk prices.
Janet Moxey from the New South Wales Farmers Association has welcomed the move and believes it could be due to a delay in passing on last year's high returns.
"I don't think New South Wales farmers have actually seen the flow-on of the good times in Victoria last year," Ms Moxey said.
"Farmers in New South Wales locked into contracts for a 12-month period and didn't see the step-up payments that were paid out in Victoria.
