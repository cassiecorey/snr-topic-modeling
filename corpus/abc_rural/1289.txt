Demand fuels lobster breeding research
Australian marine scientists are trying to farm tropical lobsters, in a bid to meet the insatiable appetite of the Chinese.
China is prepared to pay $30 a kilogram and demand cannot be met from wild stocks.
Mike Hall, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, says the biggest challenge to farming lobster is overcoming the disease problems which kill young larvae.
"If we can get these animals from eggs through the larval phase and through the grow out phase to harvesting in a very short time, or in a short time, you're going to have a higher profit margin than one that takes extremely long," he said.
