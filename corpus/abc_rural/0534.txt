Boom time for feedlots
Strong export demand and the ongoing drought have pushed the feedlot sector to record heights.
Australia now has just under 900,000 head of cattle on feed, with Queensland and Western Australia recording the biggest jumps.
But Malcolm Foster from the Lotfeeders Association has sounded a note of caution.
He says the United States could be back supplying beef into Japan and Korea as early as next month, which will provide stiff competition for our grain-fed product.
"It is very good news, but this situation's been going on now for two years," he said.
