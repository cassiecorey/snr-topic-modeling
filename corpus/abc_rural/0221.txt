Drought relief funding increase raises questions
The Productivity Commission says the Federal Government's 100 per cent increase in drought relief funding may need investigation.
Drought relief is set to top $600 million in 2005/06 and receives special mentions in the commission's annual review of government expenditure.
Chairman Gary Banks says the commission is not questioning the need for assistance but says any single item costing more than half a billion dollars could spark calls for a review.
"There is always a questions about that," he said.
"We never know whether we have got the model exactly right in any area of industry support.
"Clearly drought assistance is extremely important and you wouldn't want to make any changes without very careful examination of all the issues.
