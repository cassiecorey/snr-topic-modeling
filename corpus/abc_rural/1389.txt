BHP tipped to break own profit record
After posting a record profit of $13 billion, analysts say BHP Billiton could be set for an even bigger result next year.
Hartley's resources expert Rob Brierly says increased demand from China and India should drive next year's profit to more than $15 billion.
He predicts the price of nickel, copper, iron ore and oil will continue to rise, putting BHP in line to continue to break records in Australian corporate history.
