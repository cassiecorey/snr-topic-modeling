Inmates trained to become croc farmers
Inmates from the Darwin Correctional Centre have been trained to become the next generation of Northern Territory crocodile farmers.
Farmer Mick Burns helped to develop the croc handling course, which is designed for prisoners from remote communities where problem crocodiles are common.
He says there are huge growth opportunities for farming and harvesting skin, and meat.
'I think that there is real value in terms of development of the crocodile industry to develop regional satellite farms," he said.
"All we can really do is present the opportunity and make sure that we have the infrastructure and the training, and the like, and then it's really up to the communities.
"So whether they are ex-prisoners or they are not, a lot of it is just about creating an opportunity and we are pretty happy to be doing that.
