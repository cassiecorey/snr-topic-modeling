Quarantine protocols imposed on NZ avocados
Biosecurity Australia has imposed new quarantine protocols on avocados imported from New Zealand.
The disease avocado scab has been found in New Zealand and is not known to be in Australia.
The new rules will require fruit to be sprayed before harvest and dipped in copper after harvest.
Hugh Moore from NZ Avocado Growers says 90 per cent of the crop comes to Australia in a market worth $30 million and he is rejecting any suggestion that fruit imports should be banned.
"The spraying mechanisms do work and that's in their own science," he said.
