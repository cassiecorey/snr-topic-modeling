Stanton urges HGP declaration on beef
Nutritionist Rosemary Stanton is calling for better meat labelling that tells consumers whether Hormone Growth Promotants (HGPs) have been used in producing beef.
The Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority believes promotants are used to produce 40 per cent of all beef produced in Australia.
With a ban on HGPs in the European Union, Ms Stanton says shoppers here should be told about the history of the meat they are buying.
"There are two ways you could do this," she said.
"You could just simply label the beef that comes from animals that don't have HGPs, so that it could be no HGPs used in the production of this meat, or the second way would be that you could say that they have been used."
