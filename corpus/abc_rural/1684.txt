Dept defends performance of Indigenous pastoral enterprises
The organisation that supports the development of Indigenous pastoral enterprises in the Kimberley has defended the performance of the organisations.
A Meat and Livestock Australia report into the economic viability of Aboriginal pastoral companies in northern Western Australia found productivity and stocking rates were generally poor, compared with non-Indigenous owned properties.
But Russell Show from WA's Agriculture and Food Department says the report is too negative.
"The report's accurate but it's not complete," he said.
"And in fact in the review it suggests that there are uses, multiple uses that Aboriginal communities want on their properties and that those uses by their nature maybe mutually exclusive but we've discovered that they're not.
