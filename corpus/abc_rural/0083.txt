Probe into low Vic commodity prices
The Federal Government is setting up a taskforce to investigate the impact of low commodity prices in western and north-western Victoria.
Farmers say low grain, wool, grape and citrus prices are crippling the economies of rural communities.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Government will not subsidise farmers, but will try to reduce cost burdens.
Hindmarsh mayor Darryl Argall says the taskforce will give rural communities more direct contact with the Federal Goverment.
