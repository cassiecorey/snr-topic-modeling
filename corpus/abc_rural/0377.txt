Adelaide River battles flooding
The Northern Territory community of Adelaide River is battling flooding in the wake of tropical cyclone Monica.
More than 150 millimetres of rain fell on Anzac Day alone this week.
Kai Hansen lives on Goat Island on the western edge of Kakadu National Park and says brown, crocodile-infested waters are roaring past his house.
"There is no dry land left at all. We knew this beforehand that there is a potential for it to come up here but 800mm of rain in one month, and 290mm of rain in 19 hours we had - it's an incredible amount of water," he said.
"I don't think we will see any crocs because as soon as water gets a bit rough the crocs seek quieter land.
"We don't worry about it, we walk around chest deep in the water now and then outside to salvage more things and get the boats and barges tied up and get to the generator shed, and we don't even consider it."
