Cold start to winter cuts rainfall
The freezing start to winter across southern Australia could be causing the ongoing dry weather conditions.
In normal years, cold air from the Southern Ocean collides with warm air from central Australia resulting in cut-off lows, which bring rainfall.
But this year, the systems are not as strong.
Dr Peter McIntosh, from the Marine Atmospheric Research Centre, says that is because it is colder inland.
"We've speculated a little bit recently about what might be causing these cut-off lows to decrease in intensity," he said.
"We think it is a decrease in the north-south temperature gradient.
