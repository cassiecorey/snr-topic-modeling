Farming grants to aid environmental projects
The Federal Government wants to give farmers cash incentives to encourage them to carry out environmental improvements on their land.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has set a deadline of 2008 to implement the scheme, which he says will improve the environment and lift farm productivity.
Mr McGauran will not say how much the plan will cost but says the National Farmers Federation's call for a billion dollars in compensation is well off the mark.
"No where near in the ball park but before we lock ourselves into positions why don't we find a way forward," he said.
"We'll fund some pilot projects and I'm glad to say the states are showing some interest and a number are showing strong support.
"If we work cooperatively we'll find a way to strike the balance between conservation or environment and production."
The NFF has welcomed the announcement, and says the scheme should not be viewed as a cash handout or production subsidy.
President Peter Corish says farmers manage 60 per cent of Australia's land and deserve to be rewarded for their environmental works.
"Farmers are asked to manage that native vegetation at their own cost and we believe firmly if the community wants to maintain that native vegetation, certainly that farmer should be rewarded for managing that," he said.
