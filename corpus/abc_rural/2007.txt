Rain expected to boost locust numbers
Farmers in Western Australia's wheatbelt received significant rainfall from thunderstorms at the weekend but it is creating problems for growers trying to harvest crops.
Falls of between 15 and 20 millimetres were recorded on average but there are now concerns the rain will cause an increase in locust numbers.
Entomologist Kevin Walden says the rain will give the current locust plague a boost.
"The adult locusts will survive well now," he said.
"They'll move probably larger distances than they normally would if they didn't have any rainfall and there definitely is the possibility of an air glade.
