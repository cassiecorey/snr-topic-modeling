AWB plan 'not a permanent solution'
The US wheat industry has rejected AWB's plan to split the company into two separate businesses.
US Wheat Associates claims the AWB split into a grower-owned operator controlling exports and a commercial agribusiness firm does not get rid of the single desk monopoly targeted by the US.
"We believe that any solution that leaves a monopoly in place in Australia, Canada, wherever it is, no matter how you shuffle the boxes around or shift responsibility from one organisation to another, a monopoly is not a permanent solution," spokesman Steve Mercer said.
Mr Mercer said if the new arrangement leaves in place veto power over private exports with a new organisation or Australia's Wheat Export Authority it is still a monopoly and must be ended.
The Australian Grains Exporters Association is also critical of the split because it will not make the market contestable until next harvest.
AWB will seek the approval of shareholders after its annual general meeting in February.
But association spokesperson Alick Osborne says that is not good enough.
"If this gets up at all, it won't be until the middle of next year which is far too late for growers, particularly those growers in Western Australia, who are trying to make marketing decisions for the wheat they produce this harvest and are not comfortable with the lack of choice being provided to them today," Mr Osborne said.
