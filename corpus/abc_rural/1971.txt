Sawmillers worried about long-term viability
Tasmanian sawmillers are concerned that a downturn in the wood chip market could undermine their long-term viability.
Forestry Tasmania's annual report has revealed a 24 per cent fall in wood chip sales, and a 9 per cent reduction in sawlogs.
Fred Ralph from the Country Sawmillers Federation blames the drop in saw log sales to the slow down in the construction of new homes.
But he is concerned that when the industry recovers, mills will not be able to sell their wood chip residues.
