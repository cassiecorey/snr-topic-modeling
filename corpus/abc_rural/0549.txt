Research centres' economic benefits to be evaluated
Australia's Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) are under review again.
The CRCs are partnerships between government, industry and scientific institutes, undertaking research and development.
To ensure future funding, the economic benefits of individual programs and centres will now be evaluated but Tony Staley from the CRC Association says it is hard to estimate the value of agricultural research.
"And happily the governments are prepared to fund the next part of this work to endeavour to get a real handle, as much as you can, on those cases where you've got thousands of farmers, thousands of small businesses implementing practices, that have been ... recommended and adopted by many many thousands of people and it's very very hard to measure," he said.
Meanwhile there are calls to establish a co-operative research centre for small farms.
North west Victorian horticulturalist Jim Belbin says properties of between 10 and 30 acres are struggling to compete against much larger farms.
He believes an organisation should examine which crops could be sustainably farmed on smaller holdings of land.
"I am certain that there are crops that require intensive farming that are suitable to small holdings," he said.
