Cattlemen claim best season in years
Cattlemen south-west of Darwin are hailing their best season in years.
The heavy wet season has seen a growing number of cattle being fattened in the Douglas Daly region.
Producer Ian Mcbean says the conditions should see an increase in the number of cattle going into the territory's live export trade.
"It is definitely the best season I have ever seen in the 50 odd years I have been in the Territory, really good growing season," he said.
