Wheat export changes may compromise national pool: AWB
Wheat exporter AWB says a lack of clarity in the Federal Government's changes to the wheat export system could compromise the national pool.
In the wake of the Cole inquiry, the Government will take control of AWB's veto power over wheat exports for six months while it discusses the future of the single desk.
AWB says the change will prevent the company from forecasting future earnings.
Managing director Gordon Davis says he will meet with Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran to discuss the impact on growers who have already delivered wheat to the national pool.
"Under the previous obligations, AWBI had the ability to veto exports if it considered they weren't in the interest of the national pool," he said.
"In these transitional arrangements, the Minister will have an obligation to make decisions in the public interest.
"The arrangements are very complex as they currently are and there's a range of interests that need to be satisfied in any discussions."
