Fleece samples could face phase-out
Displaying fleece samples at wool auctions could be a thing of the past under moves to change the way the raw fibre is sold.
The Australian Wool Testing Authority is developing an objective measurement selling system, which will provide more detailed descriptions of wool instead.
The authority's Ian Ashburn says the trial is being driven by wool brokers, but there is some buyer support as well.
"The main feedback has been quite positive from the brokers. Like I said, we have been approached, because of our independence to undertake these activities, from brokers and some buyers in the past six to 12 months," he said.
