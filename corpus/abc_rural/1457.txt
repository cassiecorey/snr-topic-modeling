Worker relocation scheme raises social concerns
Social welfare groups have concerns about Federal Government plans to pay the unemployed to move to regional areas to fill labour shortages.
Under a pilot scheme, the Government will offer potential workers up to $5,000 to move from areas with above-average unemployment.
The Agrifoods Industry Skills Council says there needs to be major infrastructure infrastructure to make the project work.
Lin Hatfield-Dodds, from the Australian Council of Social Service, has concerns about the impact of the proposal on workers.
"Our concern is just if people do move for work what happens if that job doesn't work out, what supports and what safety nets are we going to put in place to enable people to go back to where they've come from?" she said.
"But there's also and probably more importantly the organisational and emotional costs of moving and the relational costs.
"People who do move a large distance for work often find that they can feel isolated."
The mining sector does not think the project will help ease the labour shortage.
Reg Howard-Smith, from the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy, says the practice of flying workers in and out of mine sites could be a major stumbling block.
"We haven't seen details on what's proposed but if it's a requirement to live in a regional centre, then obviously that precludes people working on a fly-in fly-out basis," he said.
