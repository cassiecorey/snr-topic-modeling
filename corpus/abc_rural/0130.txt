CSIRO works with grain farmers on harvest predictions
The CSIRO hopes new research will give graingrowers an idea of what the season will be like six months in advance.
At the moment the Bureau of Meteorology can only give a three month outlook.
Peter McIntosh, from Marine and Atmospheric Research in Hobart, says they are a step closer to helping farmers make more accurate decisions in the lead up to harvest.
"What we'd really like to be able to do is to tell the farmer whether the climate conditions in the coming six months would be really good for growing or not," Mr McIntosh said.
