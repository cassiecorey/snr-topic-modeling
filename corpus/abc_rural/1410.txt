Growth conference examines seachanges' impact
A national conference in Tasmania this week is looking at whether rural and coastal communities can continue to cope with an influx of city residents.
The 10th Sustainable Regional Economic Growth Conference has heard that the seachange and treechange trend has had mixed results.
Dr Geoff Cockfield, from the University of Southern Queensland, says city residents moving in with higher incomes and new skills, are now being hit by soaring fuel prices.
"Certainly that's going to limit some thought of commuting great distances," he said.
"On the other hand there is a possible upside to that, because high fuel prices might mean that we don't transport things in, people don't shop out quite as much.
