PETA takes live export fight to Middle East
The animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), is targetting Middle Eastern consumers in its latest campaign against Australia's live export trade.
The US-based group is paying for newspaper advertisements in Jordan, Kuwait and member nations of the United Arab Emirates, highlighting conditions on board ships used to transport sheep to the region.
PETA spokeswoman Maya Linden says the group wants to pressure the Australian Government to stop the trade, and hopes to influence lamb consumers in the Middle East as well.
"More and more Muslims are telling us that these things that are happening to the sheep are not only horribly cruel, but they also violate Islamic principles and are not Halal," she said.
