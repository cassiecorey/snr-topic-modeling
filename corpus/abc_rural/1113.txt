Egg farmer seeks tightening of free-range legislation
Consumers are being warned that eggs marked 'free-range' could actually come from caged birds.
Some producers claim that some farmers are falsely labelling their eggs and are urging consumers to look out for accreditation from an independent authority like the RSPCA.
Free range farmer Tom Fryar has told ABC TV's Landline program that there is no legal definition of the term free-range and legislation should be tightened.
