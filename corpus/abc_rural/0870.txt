Gold mining company goes into administration
One of Western Australia's historic gold companies, Croesus Mining, has slipped into administration, despite record gold prices.
Hartley's mining expert Rob Brierley says it is disappointing for the many small shareholders in the Kalgoorlie-based Croesus and he is not sure whether the company will survive the overhaul from the administrators.
"It's a bit sad really, 80 years of continous operations at Norseman, they'll to continue to operate the mine, but obviously the company is going to be under financial duress," he said.
Meanwhile, a social divide is becoming evident in central Queensland where the coal mining boom is turning to gloom for many towns.
Attractive wages at Bowen Basin coal mines have enticed thousands of people from around Australia, pushing rental prices in small rural towns to Sydney and Melbourne levels.
Marion Callow, from Clermont's Commercial Hotel, says a basic wage will not cover the rent any more.
"The contractors are coming into towns to work for the mines and then the mines themselves are providing the cheap accommodation for their workers," she said.
