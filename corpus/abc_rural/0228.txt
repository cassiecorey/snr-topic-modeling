Good turnout for district fundraiser
Around 200 people turned up in the tiny WA town of Yuna for the district's biggest fundraiser at the weekend.
The Whelarra Regatta started around five years ago and involves small teams rowing handmade rafts across a 170 metre dam.
People crowded the banks to see the teams race.
Carisa Grylls of Chapman Valley was in the UDL team and says it was a great day to show off the community.
"Well we didn't really think that we were going to win the race, so we kind of thought that we'll head towards the bar," she said.
