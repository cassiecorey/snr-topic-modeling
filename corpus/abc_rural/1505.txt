Mine to give Tiwi Is jobs boost
A new sand mine on the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin is set to boost employment for the local Aboriginal community.
Matilda Minerals will produce 200,000 tonnes of the heavy mineral concentrate, zircon-rutile over the next six years.
Managing director Bruce Maluish says he wants to reduce the environmental impact of mining an island in the Torres Strait.
"The sand averages about 4 per cent heavy mineral," he said.
"The process involves mining the sand, processing it, extracting the 5 per cent of heavy mineral and putting the sand back in the hole where it came from.
"So it's a pretty benign impact and we can be mining through areas quite quickly at low impact, and come back and rehabilitate the land quite smartly as well."
