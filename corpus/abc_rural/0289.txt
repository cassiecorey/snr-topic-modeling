Feed running low on stock routes
The long paddock is getting crowded around Narrabri, in north-west New South Wales, where 25,000 head of livestock are searching for feed on the stock routes.
Twelve thousand cattle and 13,000 sheep have been on the road in recent weeks, with the routes almost at full capacity.
Jamie Maddox from the Narrabri Rural Lands Protection Board, says it will be a harsh winter for many graziers already short of feed and water.
"We received some good late January/early February rain, which gave us a good body of feed but it's almost all disappeared now and it's certainly becoming dry," he said.
"A few dams in certain areas are drying up quickly and becoming boggy.
