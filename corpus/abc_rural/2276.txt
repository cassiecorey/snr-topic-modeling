Territory pastoralists hopeful of receiving drought assistance
There are new hopes that drought-hit pastoralists in the Northern Territory will receive federal assistance.
The Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association and the Territory Minister for Primary Industry Chris Natt have met with Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran to seek help.
Association president Roy Chisholm says although they have been knocked back twice, he is hopeful that southern producers will receive exceptional circumstances aid.
"Now there is a slightly different criteria," he said.
