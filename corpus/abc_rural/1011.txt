Kangaroo skin hits fashion capitals
Kangaroo skin is being promoted by designers and manufacturers in the fashion capitals of the world.
A company in Cairns which exports up to 18,000 skins every two months to processors in Spain, France and Italy says the skins are made into everything from clothing to footballs.
Exporter Ross Gates says the skin is proving popular because of its strength, repellent nature and pliability.
"Quite a number of the upmarket men's shoe manufacturers are starting to manufacturer their shoes from kangaroo," he said.
