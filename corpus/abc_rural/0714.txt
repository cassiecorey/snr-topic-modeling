E Timor looters destroy rice, maize reserves
Looters in the East Timor capital of Dili have destroyed more than 40 tonnes of rice and maize seed reserves.
The seed normally supports thousands of subsistence farmers across five districts.
The government has warned people not to eat the seed because it has been treated for pests and diseases and to encourage rapid early growth.
East Timorese Minister for Agriculture, Estanislau Da Silva, says more will urgently be needed for next year's crop.
"Several thousand - at least up to five to six districts - especially subsistence farmers they will suffer if we don't have those seeds readily available (by) I would say no later than September because then we will use October to distribute it," the Minister said.
