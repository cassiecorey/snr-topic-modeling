Stock route traveller praises farmers' generosity
The generosity of farmers in times of drought has astounded a woman who has been travelling the stock routes of southern New South Wales.
For the past two months, Elizabeth Murphy from the Adelaide Hills has been travelling along the Murrumbidgee River in a replica drovers wagon with two horses and a couple of chooks for company.
She says the country has dried off and water is short but farmers are always keen to help.
"The drought's so bad the farmers have got no food and yet when I was parked at Darlington Point I was swimming in the river with my grandchildren and I got out, and somebody had left a bag of horse feed for me," she said.
"I didn't even know who they were, they didn't even say hello, they just dropped it off there for me.
