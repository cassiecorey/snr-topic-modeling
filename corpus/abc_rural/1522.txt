Govt rejects call to dump freight equalisation scheme
The Federal Government has dismissed calls to scrap Tasmania's freight equalisation scheme.
Under the scheme, Tasmanian producers receive a rebate on freight to offset the high cost of shipping across Bass Straight.
A draft report just released by the Productivity Commission says the scheme is too costly and should be phased out.
But the Government says the program will stay, a move welcomed by president of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Roger Swan.
"I think the PM has put the matter to rest for now, but I think what we do see from this is that politicians of all shapes, sizes and colours understand that this is a vital issue for Tasmania's industry and it's an issue that we have to keep certainly our finger on," he said.
