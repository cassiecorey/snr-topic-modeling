Lobster fishermen deny flooding market with snapper
South Australian lobster fishermen have rejected claims they are flooding the market with snapper and forcing down prices.
The SA Rock Lobster Advisory Council says fishermen are entitled to fish for snapper in the lobster off-season but have only caught 10 tonnes of the fish since July last year.
Spokesman Daryl Spencer has denied claims that two lobster boats unloaded 10 tonnes of snapper each at Port Lincoln at the weekend.
"There's one boat at this point in time since the end of our lobster season that's actually targeted snapper and in the 10 days that he has been fishing, he's taken in total 3.9 tonnes in total," he said.
