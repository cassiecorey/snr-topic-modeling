Alliance to see cattle on Aboriginal land
A new alliance between land councils and the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association should see more cattle re-introduced to ungrazed Aboriginal land.
Properties are being leased in exchange for improved roads and fences, as well as employment and training.
A deal has just been signed to move 2,5000 head of cattle from Deep Well Station on to Haasts Bluff, west of Alice Springs.
Pastoralist Billy Hayes thinks there will be benefits for everyone involved.
"They'll be as pleased to see cattle out there as we will be," he said.
"There'll be job outcomes, you know, for the young lads in the community.
