Irrigator groups oppose Snowy Hydro sale
Key irrigator groups in southern New South Wales have withdrawn their support for the sale of the Snowy Hydro electric scheme.
They are worried about a planned 10 per cent cap on individual shareholdings after the company is sold by the federal, New South Wales and Victorian governments.
George Warne from Murray Irrigation says the proposed safeguards are not enough to protect the business from an international takeover.
"I think one of the really big issues is the fact that Australia's largest single stored water resources - the Snowy Hydro scheme and its operation and the timing of releases and the power that is generated from - it is going to leave government ownership and go into private hands," he said.
"We thought they would dissipate that effect by having a maximum cap of 5 per cent or 10 per cent that any one party could own.
