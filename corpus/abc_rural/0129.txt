Gulf graziers appeal for assistance as floodwaters rise
Graziers in Queensland's north-western Gulf country want more state help for families affected by the worst flooding in 100 years.
Authorities fear the damage bill will run to millions of dollars after heavy rainfall in the wake of cylone Larry.
Bill Olive from Cliffdale Station says he had nearly 70 millimetres of water flow through his house and expects significant stock losses.
"I do hope that they do something to help a lot of people, especially people who are working in the area and a lot of the graziers," Mr Olive said.
