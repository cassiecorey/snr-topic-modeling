Govt knew of new Indonesian fruit and veg protocols
The Federal Government says it has known for almost a year that Indonesia was planning new import protocols for Australian fruit and vegetables.
The conditions were imposed last week and growers say the $35 million export trade is effectively at a standstill.
The Federal Government believes Indonesia put in the protocols aimed at protecting it from fruit fly after receiving an infected fruit shipment from another country.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says Australia lodged submissions on the protocols last year but did not hear back from Indonesia until the conditions were imposed on April 4.
"Indonesia did not respond to the submission of Australia and the various other countries before deciding on a new decree," he said.
