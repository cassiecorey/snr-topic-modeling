Rural sector 'can cope' with rate rise
A rural lender says the interest rate rise, announced by the Reserve Bank today, will not cause panic among farmers.
Neil Dobbin, the head of rural banking for Rabobank Australia, says many farmers have already fixed their loan rates and can absorb the rise.
But he says those who have recently acquired a new property or increased their borrowings may feel the pinch.
He also says a dollar at 76 cents US does not help export income.
Mr Dobbin says the main cost concerns farmers have are rising fuel and fertiliser bills.
"I think the rural sector can cope with this rise," he said.
"Seasonal conditions at this stage are generally pretty good, a lot of the commodity prices are in sound position.
