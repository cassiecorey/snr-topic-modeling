Darwin residents prepare for Monica's onslaught
Preparations for tropical cyclone Monica are under way across the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory.
The category 5 system has already created major disruptions with commercial fishing.
As tropical cyclone Monica tracks west across the Gulf of Carpentaria, many of the 75 prawn trawlers that fish the remote off-shore regions took shelter in calmer waters to the south near Karumba and the Northern Territory-Queensland border.
Others steamed back to their northern ports such as the Francis Bay Mooring Basin in Darwin.
The interruption to the banana prawn harvest has created at least one week of disrupted fishing time and wasted fuel in not ideal fishing grounds.
One of the largest companies, NewFishing Australia, estimates the disruption will cost them tens of thousands of dollars.
It is an unusual sight to see trawlers and fishing vessels in the Darwin Port in the middle of the season which ends in just under one month.
They are being double lashed to moorings with ropes and packed in tight side by side with tyre fenders between them to reduce friction.
And the level of water in this mooring basin will be dropped to allow these large vessels to rest on the bottom for the worst of the weather.
