ABARE urged to lower wheat yield estimates
A grains industry analyst says the latest forecasts for Australia's crop yields this year are too optimistic.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) has revised its harvest estimates down by 11 per cent since February but says the outlook is still quite positive.
But the editor of the Callum Downs Commodity News, Malcolm Bartholomeus, says ABARE should lower its wheat yield estimate of 22.8 million tonnes.
"If we don't get some rain right around the country very soon they will have to start factoring in some quite substantial production shortfalls from the estimate that they have published at this stage," he said.
