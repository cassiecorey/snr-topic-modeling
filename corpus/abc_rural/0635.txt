Extension granted for forestry tax change submissions
An extension of time has been granted for submissions on the changes to plantation forestry taxes.
Some of the changes include putting a cap on expenditure on plantations in the first year and tax write-offs being conditional on best practice being used.
The closing date for submissions has been extended for another month, until mid-July.
Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says it is in response to requests for more time from a number of affected farmers and foresters.
But he denies there has been a backlash to the proposed changes.
"Right around the country in rural areas some farmers are strongly in favour of the way in which these forestry plantations are operated," he said.
"Other farmers outside of the industry have concerns that there is the potential for high prices, inflated prices to be paid for land.
