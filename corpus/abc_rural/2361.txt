Riverina irrigators call for compensation
Riverina irrigators have rallied to voice their anger at New South Wales Government cuts to their water allocations, and are calling for compensation.
Rice farmers, dairy farmers and croppers, already had zero water allocations this season, but since October the NSW Government has cut 52 per cent of farmer's carry over water.
This is water farmers have saved in the previous year, to use in the current drought.
So today farmers are rallying in the streets, to show their anger at the State Government's decision.
Farmers also say a number of towns and 1,500 farming families now could run out of household water and water for stock.
