S Kidman and Co make feedlot investment
In a bid to cope with the big dry, one of South Australia's biggest pastoral companies has invested in its first feedlot.
S Kidman and Co has bought Tungali, north-east of Adelaide, and plans to grain feed around 4,000 cattle for the Japanese market.
Chief Executive Greg Campbell says conditions led to the decision.
"Really, we finish cattle on native pastures in the channel country but there are plenty of times, particularly in South Australia, properties see more droughts than they do as you go further east ," he said.
