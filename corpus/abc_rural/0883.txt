Qld farmers highlighting green thumbs
Queensland grain growers are introducing a set of environmental guidelines to show off their 'green' credentials.
Lobby group Agforce is collating a best management practice manual in the Fitzroy Basin, in central Queensland, with plans to roll it out across the nation.
Spokesman Kym Bremner says they want to prove to the Government and urban Australians that they are being pro-active and addressing problems.
"The uptake of zero till, while it's been fairly spectacular, is still something that people need to work on," Mr Bremner said
