Analysts urge consortium to move quickly on Iraq wheat deal
Grains industry analysts say Australia could lose a deal to supply hundreds of tonnes of wheat to Iraq, unless it moves quickly to seal the contract.
Media reports from Baghdad say the Iraqi Grains Board is refusing to agree to the deal unless it controls shipping arrangements, accusing Australia of over-inflating transport costs.
Analyst Lloyd George says dealing with Iraq is not a simple process.
"You know those terms and conditions can vary from customer to customer significantly and hence the risks vary with that as well," Mr George said.
"Even in the past day or so it's been talked about in the United States that Iraq is essentially looking around for another 300,000 tonnes of wheat out of the United States, which suggests they may be starting to look in other directions if business hasn't been concluded."
