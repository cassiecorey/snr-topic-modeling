Roma saleyards for sale
Australia's biggest saleyard complex is on the market.
The council-owned Roma saleyards in southern Queensland will most likely be put out to tender in the New Year.
But yard managers are already denying a possible sale will squeeze out smaller independent agents in favour of big companies like Elders and Landmark.
Chairman of the Roma saleyards board Rob Loughnan says it is early days in the tender process and a sale would have to benefit all parties.
"I want to hear from people about whether they think it would be better in private or public ownership," he said.
"Its not just he money we're talking about, if someone wants to buy it just to shut it down in favour of another centre somewhere, you know, away from Roma, so Roma loses the benefit of 400,000 cattle throughput a year, that's not going to be of interest to us," he said.
Major livestock agent Elders has denied it is behind the possible sale of Roma.
Queensland livestock manager, Tony Gooden is rejecting speculation that his company is either interested in buying the yards, or setting up its own facility in competition to the council-run centre.
