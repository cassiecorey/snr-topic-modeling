Live exports to Egypt halted
The Federal Government has halted live cattle exports to Egypt in the wake of mistreatment claims.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says $350,000 was spent on improving the treatment of cattle at the Bassatin Abattoir in Egypt after cruelty concerns were first raised in 2003.
But Channel Nine's 60 Minutes program last night showed footage of cattle having their tendons cut, which the program says was filmed last month.
Mr McGauran says his decision to halt the trade while the claims are investigated, is not an extreme reaction.
"We shouldn't be defensive about this," he said.
"Where allegations are made, no matter how ill-founded or how lacking in evidence we must confront it head-on if we are to retain the confidence of the general public and fulfil our responsibilities to farmers."
Meat and Livestock Australia says the ban sets a bad precedent.
General manager of live exports, Mike Hayward says he is certain the cattle showed in the 60 Minutes footage were not from Australia.
And he denies suggestions little has changed since the cruelty claims were first raised three years ago.
