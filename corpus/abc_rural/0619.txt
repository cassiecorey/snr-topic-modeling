AQIS officers on alert in NT
Quarantine authorities in the Northern Territory are on full alert, as evacuees from East Timor continue to arrive.
More than 700 of the estimated 25,000 people displaced from Dili have flown into Darwin.
C-130 Hercules cargo planes are carrying up to 180 evacuees at a time from Dili to Darwin on unscheduled flights.
So far, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has checked over 720 evacuees from East Timor and 209 crew from the Defence Force.
Whilst many of the passengers are traumatised and are carrying the bare minimum in the haste to escape the unrest, all bags are being X-rayed or searched for exotic plants like siam and khaki weed, and diseases such as grapevine leaf rust.
The giant African snail is also a major risk, and clothing, and footwear is being searched for its eggs, which can be carried in soil material.
