Qld Govt mulls water charge freeze
The Queensland Government says it will consider calls for a freeze on water charges.
The lobby groups Agforce and the Queensland Farmers Federation want charges waived for irrigation water that will not be delivered this year.
Natural Resources and Water Minister Craig Wallace says the Government is costing the proposal, but wants the Federal Government to contribute.
"The Acting Premier has given an undertaking to consider the Commonwealth and Agforce to implement water charging rate relief for people who are in exceptional circumstances," he said.
