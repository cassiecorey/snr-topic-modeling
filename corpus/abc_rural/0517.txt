Eldest children not always the best farm managers: research
New research has shown the tradition of passing the farm onto the eldest child could be costing the sector its best talent.
Psychologist and social researcher, Dr Ian Ploughman, says by nature, older children are more conservative.
He says younger siblings tend to be the most innovative and creative, but do not have the opportunity to contribute.
"The younger brothers and sisters commonly have less interest in staying on the farm, and are more creative and more mobile," he said.
