Mango growers expect bumper harvest
The Australian mango harvest has begun, with picking under way at Pine Creek in the Northern Territory.
Early indications suggest a bumper crop but despite the amount of fruit, growers are still hopeful of strong prices.
Michelle Hill, who manages the Pine Creek Plantation, says cyclone Larry's impact on banana prices could have a positive spin-off for mangoes.
"We've been paying a lot of money for bananas over the last sort of six months so I think that the mangoes will come in and people will go, 'Oh gee these are not so expensive'," she said.
