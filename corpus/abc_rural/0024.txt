Farmers and ag agencies get speedy aid to farmers
The state government has announced it will commit millions of dollars to the recovery effort for the new year bushfires including the blaze in the Grampians and a ministerial task force is to start assessing need. The government says it will also help landowners facing hardship as a result of their water supplies being used by firefighting. But already, Department of Primary Industry officers, the Victorian Farmers Federation, haulage contractors and farmers all over western Victoria, have been working at a grassroots level to help fire affected landowners. Hundreds of tonnes of hay, 21 semi-loads of which was brought to a collection point at Moyston from Warrnambool yesterday, has been donated to farmers who need fodder for their surviving animals. Bruce McKay says he has been on farms helping to put sheep down and fixing fencing in the Willaura area. Tim Wrench from the Warrnambool Coop says people came from all around the area to donate hay. Haulier Scott Wilson from Koroit said when he went onto farms to collect hay people said "just load up until you're full". Neil James from the DPI says hay is being donated from New South Wales and South Australia. Charlie DeFegeley from the VFF says the response has been amazing.
