Farmers fined over land blockades
For the first time, farmers in the central west of New South Wales have been fined for stopping state authorities from investigating claims of illegal land clearing.
Farmers have blockaded two properties at Tottenham at the weekend.
The Department of Natural Resources says it had warned farmer representative that fines would be imposed if access was blocked.
One infringement notice for an $1,100 fine has been served, with another two to be handed out this week.
Department spokesman Steve Dunn says attempts had been made to work with land holders but the department has a duty to carry out inspections.
