Top End crabbers facing tough times
Commercial crabbers in the Northern Territory say the industry will be forced to downsize under major new restrictions.
Thirty per cent fewer crabs will be able to be caught under amendments to the Territory mudcrab plan and there will be tougher penalties for breaching catch limits.
Chris Calogerous of Sea King Seafoods is disappointed there is no provision to buy out any of the 49 commercial licence holders.
"Most of us feel like we've been kicked in the guts. Our advice has been ignored and I can see how this is effectively going to put this industry under extreme pressure," he said.
"We support all the rules relating to tougher penalties but this size limit increase of 10 mm basically means that we're going to not be able to harvest crabs in the Gulf because a large proportion of the crabs there are always a smaller crab.
