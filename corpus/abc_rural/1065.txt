Dried fruits industry to take on snack foods sector
The dried fruit industry says it will tackle the snack foods market in an effort to counter the growing competition from cheap imports.
Growers and processors say they cannot compete with the cost of production in Turkey and Iran to supply the lower end of the market.
Peter Jones from the Australian Dried Fruits Association says it is tough to get space on the supermarket shelves, but there is consumer demand for healthier alternatives to chocolate bars and chips.
"Traditionally we've always been looked at as being an ingredient in fruit cakes and breakfast cereals, so really we've got to go to the snacking market," he said.
