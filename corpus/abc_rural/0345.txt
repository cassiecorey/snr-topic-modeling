Court opposes chicken meat producers' bid for joint action
Farmers have lost a five year legal battle for the right to band together to refuse to supply processors.
The court action was launched by Victoria's chicken meat producers, who wanted to set a precedent for other farmers with limited contract options, including the potato, wine grape and dairy sectors.
Under the Trade Practices Act, individuals can refuse to supply produce, but not groups.
President of the Victoria Farmers' Federation's chicken meat group, John Clarke, says the Federal Court's decision is a blow.
"The processors are dealing opportunistically with growers and abusing their market power but they haven't seen fit, or the tribunal hasn't seen fit, to go the extra step and give us [the] right to have countervailing power.
