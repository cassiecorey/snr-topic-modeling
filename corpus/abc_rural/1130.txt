SA loses rural counsellors
The number of rural financial counsellors in South Australia will be scaled back, following changes to the way the service is provided.
The Federal Government spent two years reviewing the program and opened up tenders for a single, state-based provider in April.
The service will now be run by the newly formed Rural Financial Counselling South Australia.
Spokesman John Voumard says it will allow counsellors to be allocated to areas of need.
"There are periods of demand and they occur at different times in different areas," he said.
