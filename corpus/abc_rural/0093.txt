Wool market falls off
A 3 per cent fall in the US exchange this week should have led to higher wool prices in Australia.
Instead the market has fallen off, due to poor, older wool being reoffered at sales this week.
The biggest fall was in Fremantle, where there was a 15 cent drop-off.
The eastern market indicator fell seven cents to 744 cents a kilo clean.
