SA Govt accused of mismanaging fish stocks
A long-term prawn fisher in South Australia is concerned about stock levels, accusing the State Government of mismanagement.
An official report in SA has found the prawn catch is only one third what it was in the 1970s.
Commercial fisher Maurice Corigliano says the Government has allowed overfishing in Gulf St Vincent and wants boat numbers reduced.
The Government has had meetings with the fishermen and told them it is their responsibility to ensure the fishery is managed sustainably.
Mr Corigliano says the Minister for Fisheries, Rory McEwen, is dodging the issue.
"It's the Government's responsibility to manage that fishery, they have the power to say how many vessels come in, how many vessels go out, when they can fish, where they can fish, what size prawn they can take, what size vessels they can use," he said.
"Regrettably, he is simply not doing so and is simply dodging the issue."
The Prawn Boat Owners Association disagrees, saying numbers have not depleted and there is no need to reduce licences.
Currently there are only 10 licensed boats.
