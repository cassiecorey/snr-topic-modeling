Organiser pleased with beef auction prices
Central Australian beef has attracted record prices at a weekend auction at the Alice Springs Show.
The champion steer carcass, from the Holt family of Delny Station, sold for $6.70 a kilogram.
Competition organiser Nicole Hayes says she was surprise that so many drought-hit pastoralists supported the auction.
"Considering the season, we are pleased with that," she said.
"We had to support it so you have sort of got to put in what you have got and considering how dry it is at home, it's good to see.
"We just haven't got the cattle that we would have had in previous years. Our numbers are going to be right down, especially for next year.
"There's not many little calves around which is a bit unfortunate but it's as good as we can do.
