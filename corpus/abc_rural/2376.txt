Economists call for independent national water body
There are calls today for an independent, national body to control Australia's water resources.
Two water economists have put together the plan to remove political tensions between state and federal governments.
One of the plan's authors, CSIRO Professor Mike Young, says a more responsive and consistent system is needed to decide water allocations, trading rules and entitlements.
Professor Young says there is widespread concern that the current system is hamstrung by politics.
"People are very frustrated with what's happening, there's a lot of frustration around the rules over water trading and things like exit fees," he said.
"Every state is taking subtly different approaches, if you had a structure like this it would all be resolved in a unified way, so there'd be no opportunity for arbitrage from one state to another."
But there are concerns from irrigators that the proposal would leave agriculture out of the water reform process.
National Farmers Federation irrigation task force spokesman Laurie Arthur says farmers need to be represented.
"I have real concerns that agriculture will not be front and centre of the debate," he said.
"I'm a little bit concerned at the moment that expertise within agriculture for example, within our irrigation companies, is a bit remote from the decision-making process."
