Italian company doubles Aust wool purchases
The wool industry is claiming a win, following news that Italian fashion giant Benetton will double its purchase of Australian wool over the next two years.
Last year, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ended a nine month campaign to pressure Benetton to boycott Australian wool, over its concerns about the practice of mulesing.
