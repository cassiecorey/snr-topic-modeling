Processors fail to meet kangaroo meat demand
International demand for kangaroo meat is putting pressure on Australian processors.
Despite high prices, harvesting quotas are not being met leaving a big gap in the market.
Phil Franolick from King River International Processors in Perth says Europeans are attracted to the meat's low fat content and Russians are consuming large amounts of kangaroo sausages and mince.
"As far as I know every skerrick of manufactured meat that is produced by human consumption processors virtually goes to the Russian market now," he said.
