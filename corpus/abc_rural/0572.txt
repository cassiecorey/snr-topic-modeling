Continuing bear market may lead to nervous investors
The Australian Stock Exchange has begun trading marginally weaker, despite stronger commodity prices on the London Metal Exchange overnight.
In 10 days the local market has dropped $80 billion, reacting to weakening metal prices.
Although many analysts say the market needed a correction, Hartleys resource expert Rob Brierley says investors will start to get nervous if this bear market continues.
"Probably another week of this and people would be extremely worried," he said.
