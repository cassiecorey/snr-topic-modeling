Mashes committee winds up
Landholders in the Macquarie Marshes of central western New South Wales have been forced to disband their local management committee because of ongoing drought and a lack of funding.
Scientists say the marsh is the largest nesting site in Australia for waterbirds like egrets, ibis and heron but over the last four years it has been so dry the birds have been unable to nest.
Sue Jones, from the now defunct management committee, says it is a struggle to survive.
"With drought and reduced flows in the river, landholders just cannot keep going," she said.
"They need to at the moment put their time and resources into their own enterprises just to keep themselves afloat.
