Fires begin to merge as winds shift
Fire authorities in Victoria are warning that 600,000 hectares of Alpine country in the state's north and south-east could be on fire by the weekend.
Fires sparked by lightning strikes earlier this week are merging as winds shift.
Temperatures are set to climb into the high 30s on Saturday, along with predicted hot northerly winds.

"We've gone through our family photographs and things that connect you to your ancestors and so forth, they've all been put in a bag," he said.
