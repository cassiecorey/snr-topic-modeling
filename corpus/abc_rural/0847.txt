NT aerial medial team celebrates milestone
There is another medical team celebrating 60 years in the air.
The Top End Aerial Medical Service averages six flights a day, caring for those living north of Elliott in the Northern Territory, and also serves offshore oil rigs and parts of South-East Asia.
Flight nurse Marg Fuller has been on board for half of the service's history, and has one particularly happy memory.
