East Timor joins in Anzac services
A special Anzac Day dawn service has been held in Dili, the capital of East Timor.
It has commemorated 11 Australian soldiers believed to have died there in 1942.
During World War II, Australia's Sparrow Force worked deep in the rugged mountain jungles of East Timor.
Helio Tavares says they conducted guerrilla operations against the Japanese and were supported by the Timorese people.
"During World War II the Timorese, supported the Australians, because they didn't want East Timor to be invaded by the Japanese Army," he said.
"Throughout the four years of struggle, up to 44,000 Timorese died assisting Australian soldiers.
"The Timorese really value that relationship with Australia and we can see it today.
"The Prime Minister addressing the people and saying that Australia is a very important neighbour and a partner in the development of the country."
The school of the air in outback Queensland is also getting into the Anzac spirit.
A group of students from cattle stations in the Richmond area west of Townsville has spent weeks practising the national anthem to perform for the local Anzac parade.
