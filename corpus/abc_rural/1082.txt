'Contractual requirements' delay wheat shipment
There have been more delays in shipping wheat to India, with grain from Western Australia under intense scrutiny to ensure it meets tough contractual requirements.
Quarantine concerns have held up two previous shipments to India this year.
The latest consignment is being loaded onto a ship at Esperance today, which has been waiting in the bay for more than two weeks.
AWB'S Western Australian manager, Paul Ryan, says a combination of factors caused the delay.
"There's a very strict and extensive pre-testing and testing program before the vessel is loaded that has to be adhered to under this Indian contract," he said.
