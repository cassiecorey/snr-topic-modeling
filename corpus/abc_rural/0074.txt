McCain cuts hit Vic potato farmers
Potato growers in Victoria are facing a 10 per cent supply cut and lower prices from food processor McCain this year.
Negotiations on this year's contracts started in the middle of last year and the federal industry and produce ombudsman has been called in to try to resolve the dispute.
President David Myers says it is unfair, when fuel costs have gone up for producers.
"We want a finalisation of the contracts," he said.
