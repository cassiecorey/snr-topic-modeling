Merino prices plummet
Prices for top merino sheep have plummeted at the annual Yass circuit sale, in New South Wales, once a stronghold for fine and superfine wool.
With a larger offering than last year, merino sheep and cross bred lambs are being offloaded as the drought bites deeper, with ewes being passed in for $1.50 each.
The average price for Roseville ewes of the Merryville line was $10, down from a height of $70 in previous years.
Richard Buckmaster says the low prices will hurt farmers.
"It's very disappointing. I know we've got bad seasons and everything but I think this is the worst we've had in 17 years of circuit sales," Mr Buckmaster said.
In general, the wool market has eased this week, falling 2 per cent at sales in Sydney, Fremantle and Melbourne.
The eastern market indicator (EMI) fell 18 cents, to finish the week at 826 cents a kilogram.
