Floodwaters affect search for banana prawns
Floodwaters and muddy river sediments are making it hard for trawlers in the Gulf of Carpentaria this season.
The banana prawn harvest began on Saturday, across the northern fishery.
Newfishing Australia's Steven Valentine says the fleet is being forced to use depth sounders to find the prawns.
"With the water clarity not being as it is - not very good, due to the mud slick - and we can't spot the mud boils, boats are having to rely heavily on their sounders, which means we don't cover the area quite so efficiently," he said.
"So it's been a pretty slow start to the season.
"Traditionally we road freight them out of Karumba. But, at the moment, with all the roads closed, we haven't got anywhere to send them to.
"Hopefully within the next four to five days, the rivers will drop enough so that the roads will be open and we can truck prawns out."
The Newfishing Australia fleet is hoping to catch up to 60 tonnes of banana prawns per trawler this season.
