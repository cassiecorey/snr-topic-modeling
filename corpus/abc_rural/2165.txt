Water use for timber plantations to be managed
Tasmania is moving to manage water use by the timber plantation sector as part of a review of its Water Management Act.
The review is recommending a study of water rights security and tenure, changes to the dams approval process and a risk management strategy for water use by large scale land use changes.
Alan Harradine from the Department of Primary Industries and Water says catchment models need to be refined.
"Under the National Water Initiative we basically are required to put in place those options," he said.
