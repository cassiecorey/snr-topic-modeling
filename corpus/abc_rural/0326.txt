Egg producers unhappy at adjustment package rejection
Egg producers are furious that a meeting of state and federal primary industries ministers has refused to endorse a $23 million adjustment package.
The funds would have helped farmers to leave the sector if they could not afford to upgrade to bigger hen cages under new animal welfare laws.
President Jeff Ironside says the changes are being imposed by government and compensation should be paid.
"Unfortunately you can't do anything with the old systems because they don't lend themselves to tampering with the size," he said.
"So egg producers virtually have to go out and buy new equipment to comply with the new regulations because it is around about 50 bucks a bird, you know a farm with 20,000 birds, a million dollars."
