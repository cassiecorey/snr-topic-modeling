Darling River weirs may prolong water period
Two temporary weirs have been built on the lower portion of the Darling River in far western New South Wales to shore up water supplies.
The weirs, about 50 kilometres north of Wentworth, are built from compacted clay banks containing large pipes and regulators.
Alan Whyte from Jamesville Station says it will not drought-proof the Darling, but it will give landholders a more reliable water supply.
"We know the river is going to cease to flow within two or three months' time," he said.
"There was an opportunity to put some banks in to hold up a bit of water particularly for a few people who are below the existing Tulney Weir.
