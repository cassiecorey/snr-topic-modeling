Chemical ban will see return to old-fashioned farming: grain growers
Grain growers say they will be forced to return to old-fashioned and inefficient farming methods, due to a new chemical ban.
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has banned the use of 24 weed killers containing chemicals known as 2,4-D short chain esters, due to concerns about contamination of vineyards and horticultural crops.
Garry Hansen from the South Australian Farmers Federation says grain growers will be forced to use more expensive chemicals, which they cannot afford in the current climate.
