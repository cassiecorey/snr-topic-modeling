Vic growers to let grapes rot
For the first time, grapes will be left to rot this harvest in one of Victoria's premium grape growing areas.
Poor prices and a lack of contracts are being blamed for the plight of growers in the King Valley, in the state's north-east.
Producing 30 per cent of the state's top, higher priced varieties, Wendy Batey from King Valley Vignerons, says growers are too scared to talk publicly.
"Well growers are really reluctant to speak out because they're in such an incredibly vulnerable position financially," she said.
"They've been selling, many of them have been selling grapes for four years below cost and they're basically quite frightened of jeopardising their fruit sales this year.
