Company offers incentives to encourage truckies to stay
A major trucking company is planning to pay incentives to its drivers to encourage them to stay in the industry.
Road Trains of Australia says it is hard to find staff with many drivers being lured into the mining sector.
While a national campaign is under way to attract more young people towards a career in transport, Mike Bailey from Road Trains' Mount Isa branch, says the company needs to make an effort to ease the skills shortage.
"We're trying to start a scheme where - just within ourselves - that they get rewarded if they stay in the industry, in our employment, for a number of years," he said.
"At the end of that time they'll get a bonus or whatever for hanging in there, it'll be like a miniature long service leave sort of thing."
