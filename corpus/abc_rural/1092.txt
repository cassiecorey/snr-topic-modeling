Project Gold to tell farm families' stories
A youth arts project has been launched in southern New South Wales to stimulate debate about water use and drought.
Under Project Gold more than 30 students will develop digital and media skills by working with the not-for-profit organisation BIG hART.
Spokesman Casey Ankers says their new skills will be used to tell the stories of farm families from southern Queensland to northern Victoria.
"What we're looking at doing is skilling up the young people to work with us, work with the BIG hART artists and go out to rural communities and gather narratives from rural families that have been affected by the drought," he said.
