Anderson urged to put off retirement
Former deputy prime minister John Anderson is reportedly being urged by the National Party to shelve his retirement plans, to try to stop his federal seat from being abolished.
The Nationals say the Australian Electoral Commission's plan to merge the Gwydir electorate with Parkes in New South Wales is an attack on country Australia.
As well as urging the commission to hear community concerns firsthand, Gwydir Electorate Council chairman, Mark Coulton, wants people of all political persuasions to lobby against the proposal.
"John made the point yesterday that if he was still the deputy prime minister, would Gwydir have been abolished?" he said.
"I think everyone knows the answer would be no, so whether John stays or not is a different issue.
"A simple solution like that I think we're too far down the track for that."
