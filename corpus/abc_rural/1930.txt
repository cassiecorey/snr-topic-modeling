ABARE farm production estimates lowered again
There is another gloomy forecast from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) today.
It has further lowered its estimate for this year's drought-hit wheat harvest to 9.5 million tonnes, the smallest crop since 1995.
It says the national barley crop could drop 64 per cent on last year, with canola yields down 69 per cent.
ABARE also says beef earnings are expected to fall 13 per cent.
