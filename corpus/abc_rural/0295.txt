Drought program speeds up aid applications
Farmers will get faster access to drought assistance under new changes unveiled by state and federal agriculture ministers today.
They are the first in a raft of drought assistance changes farmers hope to see over the next six months.
The National Agricultural Monitoring System (NAMS) is expected to slash the time it takes to gather the information farmers need to lodge a drought assistance application.
It will provide instant online rainfall, soil moisture, crop yield and commodity price information, streamlining contact between farmers and local, state and federal governments.
Vice-president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) Charles Burke says there needs to be fundamental change to the way drought assistance is delivered but this is a positive first step that will help farmers.
"It'll really give an overall picture of say one particular region and how it's performing in a drought," he said.
