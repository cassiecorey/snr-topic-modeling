Australian consortium launches new beef marketing strategy
A big push into 4,000 Japanese supermarkets has been launched by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) and the Australian Agricultural Company.
Qantas and Wolf Blass are also joining the marketing strategy, to promote Aussie beef in the lead-up to Christmas.
MLA's managing director David Palmer says it is a unique marketing plan to snare ongoing commitment from tough Japanese consumers, and fight off competition from the US.
"It's an initiative to help continue to drive that loyalty, to help to continue to hold shelf space here in the Japanese retail market," he said.
