Water restrictions yet to be introduced in Broken Hill
Despite the critical shortage of water in the Menindee Lakes in western New South Wales, the city of Broken Hill remains without water restrictions.
The lakes system, which supplies the city with all its water, is down to just 14 per cent capacity.
But Country Energy's Brian Steffan says restrictions have not been introduced, partly because of concerns about lead poisoning.
"Broken Hill being situated where it is has significant issues with lead dust, so what we need to do is make sure that we have enough water," he said.
"We use more water than other eastern cities [and] towns because we need to make sure that we have water to keep the lead dust down."
Meanwhile high security irrigators in the New South Wales Murray Valley have become the latest farmers to have their water allocations reduced.
Allocations are now back to 80 per cent of entitlement.
A similar cutback was made recently in South Australia.
The New South Wales Government says inflows in September were the lowest on record and there has been no October rain so far.
The chairman of the New South Wales Irrigators Council, Col Thomson, says he is not surprised by the decision, which he says will affect many farmers.
"Dairy farmers and those people that haven't had enough water on low security have been very active in the market and a lot of high security have traded down to what they would normally use in a year," he said.
