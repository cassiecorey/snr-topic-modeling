Polystyrene fish sculpture aims to raise environmental awareness
The largest murray cod ever photographed is slowly being carved out of polystyrene by communities along the River Murray.
South Australian sculptor and geologist Indiana James has been encouraging people to help him replicate the huge cod, which was nearly two and a half metres long and weighed a whopping 180 kilograms.
He is hoping to raise environmental awareness through his journey which began in 2002.
"Everybody loves a big fish and a big fish story," he said.
"I knew a lot of people would come and talk about the fish, and my real agenda is the health of the river and keeping an awareness of the health of the river in the public eye.
