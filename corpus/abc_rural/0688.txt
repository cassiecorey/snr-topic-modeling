McGuigan Simeon may extend fruit contract suspension
McGuigan Simeon Wines says contracts with grape growers in the Murray Valley and Riverland are likely to remain suspended until after next harvest.
Supply agreements involving 160 growers were placed on hold in December last year, due to a national oversupply.
A large amount of fruit was left to rot in vineyards or sold below the cost of production.
Mike Stone from Murray Valley Winegrowers says growers are devastated by the decision to extend the suspension and now have to consider how to manage their vineyards.
"Growers have been given plenty of notice unlike in 2005 when they were told in December two months before the 06 harvest that their fruit was to be suspended," he said.
