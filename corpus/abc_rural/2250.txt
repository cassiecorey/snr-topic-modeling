Qld mandarins to be supplied at Beijing Olympics
Mandarins from Queensland will be served during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
The export win comes just months after the first shipment of honey murcott mandarins was sent to China under strict new quarantine protocols.
It is welcome news for growers who lost fruit in recent hail storms.
But Graham McCosker from the grower co-operative, Gayndah Packers, says the biggest challenge will be meeting demand.
"It's just astronomical, we just came back from China a few months ago, we met a buyer from Beijing," he said.
"She was very interested, she said, 'I will buy, I will buy' [and] she said, 'I would like to take 300-500 containers per year'," he said.
