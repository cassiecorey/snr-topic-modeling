Drought expected to drive more from farms
Demographers and farm organisations say the severity of the drought is likely to accelerate the trend of primary producers leaving the land.
The National Farmers Federation says it does not expect an exodus, but the drought will continue the trend of fewer farmers running bigger properties.
Social researcher for the Victorian Department of Primary Industries, Dr Neil Barr, says history suggests fewer young people will become farmers.
"In the census period before the 1983 drought there were 10,000 people aged in their late 20s, 25-30 that entered farming in the five years before it, and then in the late 1980s that had dropped to 6,000," he said.
