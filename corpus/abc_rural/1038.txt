Science in the paddock wins award for school
An isolated high school in north-west Tasmania has gained national recognition for taking science classes to the farm paddock.
Smithton High beat 22 other entries to win this year's Australian Rural Education Award.
Science students tested local soil and water quality and then reported back to local wool company Woolnorth.
Assistant principal Susan Wigg says local farmers are now lining up for help from the students.
"We are most certainly thrilled to win the award and I'm sure that the community will be proud that we have won this award," she said.
