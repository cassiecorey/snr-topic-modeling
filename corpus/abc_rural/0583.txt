Wheat sales
The scandal is continuing to affect Australia's wheat trade with Iraq.
Despite Federal Government speculation that a $90 million deal could be salvaged, a member of the consortium negotiating the deal says it has definitely failed.
Graincorp, ABB Grain and Western Australia-based CBH have been attempting to deliver $350,000 tonnes of wheat but contractual problems have stalled the deal.
