Sheep's temperament has impact on reproductive rate
'Crazy' sheep are more than just a nuisance in the yards - research has found they are are also less fertile and less productive.
Dr Alex Ball of Sheep Genetics Australia is looking at the impact of temperament in trials on his property at Armidale in New South Wales and elsewhere across Australia.
He says a nervous temperament can have an impact on how well sheep reproduce.
"We have just been basically tagging animals be they crazy or calm and what it has had is impacts on reproductive rate," he said.
"So we know our own crazy ewes they are probably rearing 20 to 30 per cent less lambs and that's mirrored by some very good research in Western Australia.
