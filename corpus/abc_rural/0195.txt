Grazier borrows boat to help save flooded cattle
A western Queensland grazier says he has had to use a boat to save cattle from floodwaters on his property.
Heavy recent rain has dumped 150 millimetres on the town of Aramac in the past 48 hours, leading to record flooding in places.
Andrew Cowper from Merino Downs says he had to borrow his neighbour's boat to get to his cattleyards and stop weaner cattle from straying into the fast running water.
"I was worried we'd lose them if they'd got swept out of the smaller creek into the main Belltopper creek," he said.
