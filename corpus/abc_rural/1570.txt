AWB rejects grain analysts' price claims
Wheat exporter AWB has rejected claims prices being offered to growers for their wheat are not high enough.
Grain analysts believe national pool prices should be at least $10 dollars a tonne higher because of stronger global prices and small crop forecasts.
But AWB pool manager David Johnson says returns are at a fair level.
"They're not so low, we believe. I mean obviously the pool return at this point in time is forecasting prices out to 2007," he said.
"We haven't changed our pricing methodology at all, we are pricing as we normally do.
"We are always vigilant in trying to make our pool return as relevant to the market place as possible."
