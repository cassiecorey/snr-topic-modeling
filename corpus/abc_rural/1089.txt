New Middle East lamb exports record set
Australia has recorded its highest ever monthly sales figures for lamb to the Middle East.
In June, sales hit 824 tonnes - 100 tonnes higher than the previous record.
Ian Ross, the Middle Eastern manager for Meat and Livestock Australia, says the quality of Australian lamb is recognised by supermarket and restaurant buyers.
"There's a great response now to the flavour of Australian lamb, and also there's a strong awareness of [it]," he said.
"We've been doing all we can now for some time to encourage the awareness of the safety systems and the traceability, the integrity of the Australian halal system because we are talking about a Muslim community.
