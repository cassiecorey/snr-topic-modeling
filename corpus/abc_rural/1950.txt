Vine heating may eliminate frost damage
An Australian physicist says frost damage in vineyards could be eliminated if vines themselves were heated.
Most frost prevention measures concentrate on heating the air around the vines to stop frost forming.
The University of New England is researching whether electric cables can be trailed around vines to heat them by one or two degrees, to prevent grape buds from freezing.
Associate Professor Dr David Lamb says the system first appeared in France, but has never been tried in Australia.
