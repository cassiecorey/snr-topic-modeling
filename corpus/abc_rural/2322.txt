Labor pushes for wheat export system inquiry
Federal Labor's new primary industries spokesman wants an independent inquiry into whether the single desk wheat export system delivers the best value to growers.
Tasmanian Senator Kerry O'Brien says while the system delivers the best value to growers and the community, Labor will support it.
But he says the Federal Government should be appointing an independent group that would investigate wheat export marketing and report publicly to Parliament.
"To have the community debate that report, rather than this closed door approach to consultation that the Government has," he said.
