Farmers urged to consider growing truffles
Farmers looking to diversify after the drought are being urged to look at producing truffles.
It takes at least five years to produce up to 40 kilograms of truffles a hectare.
The exotic french fungus is currently fetching $3,000 a kilogram.
The Australian Truffle Growers Association is having its inaugural meeting this weekend near Canberra, although grower Wayne Haslam says potential newcomers need to know the facts.
"You've got to be careful though - if it sounds too good to be true it usually is," he said.
