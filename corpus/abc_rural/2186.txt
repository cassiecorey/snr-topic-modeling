Tasmania struggling with drought
Conditions continue to deteriorate in Tasmania after record low rainfall and river flows.
The president of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Roger Swain, says the State is experiencing one of its worst seasons in 100 years.
He says while pockets of the State are having a reasonable year, the extended dry and heavy frosts are making the season tough.
"It's quite clearly a drought, you only have to look around and see," he said.
"We're looking at the ground now almost as if it is February here in Tasmania.
The National party's resurgence in country Victoria is continuing, with more votes counted in the state election.
Labor has conceded defeat in the Gippsland seat of Morwell with the seat going to Russell Northe from the Nationals, with the help of Liberal preferences.
The Nationals also took the seat of Mildura from independent MP, Russell Savage, in a swing influenced by Labor's proposal for a toxic waste dump in the electorate.
The Nationals have increased their Lower House numbers by two to nine members in a poll where they feared they would be nearly wiped out by preference deals.
