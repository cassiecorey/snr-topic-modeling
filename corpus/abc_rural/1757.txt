Rural Australia to wait for access to $1b broadband network
Telstra has switched on its new $1 billion mobile broadband network at an investor briefing in Sydney.
But it will be quite some time before all regional Australians can use it.
Chief executive Sol Trujillo says the network is 100 times greater than any of its competitors and will reach 98 per cent of the Australian population.
However group general manager of Telstra Country Wide Geoff Booth says full access for rural Australia will not be possible until more towers are built.
"Wherever there is now mobile cover we'll have a broadband product, so we're going to be able to resolve a lot of those so-called dead spots in terms of broadband," he said.
