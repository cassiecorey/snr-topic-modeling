Govt tight-lipped on Snowy Hydro sale
The New South Wales Government has confirmed an international offer for Snowy Hydro, but says it needs to keep tight-lipped on the details.
State Finance Minister John Della Bosca said yesterday any discussion of detail before the release of the prospectus would incur the risk of litigation.
But Lester Wheatly, chair of the Murray Valley Community Action group, says it is just an excuse to keep the public in the dark.
"The Government attitude is that "look here, we're involved in very sensitive international negotiations at the moment and can't tell you anything". At the end of the day, that's just not good enough.
