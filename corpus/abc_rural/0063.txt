Japanese BSE case compounds US beef fears
The US beef industry fears even longer odds of recovering its Japanese market, after that country's first case of mad cow disease in beef cattle.
US beef producers have always expected to have an uphill battle once Japan resumed imports from the US.
But Japan's 23rd confirmed BSE case, and the first in beef cattle, may cause even longer odds in that market.
American Meat Institute spokesman John Reddington points to recent Japanese press reports.
"It's going to be pretty difficult battle for the United States to change consumers' minds about the safety of our product.
"Our major competitor, when we get back into that market, is going to be Australia."
