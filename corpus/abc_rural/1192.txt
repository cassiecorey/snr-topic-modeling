Fox find may prove costly
There is irrefutable proof that foxes are alive and thriving in Tasmania after the discovery of a still warm carcass by a farmer in the Northern Midlands yesterday.
It is believed the animal had recently been hit by a car.
Tasmania has been considered fox free and the pest could cost the state economy $8 million a year if it gets a foothold.
Wildlife biologist Nick Mooney says the fox, a young adult male, was likely to have been born in Tasmania.
He says it is the evidence that will finally silence the sceptics.
"We've had proof for years we believe," he said.
"This is just a most unfortunate and other piece of evidence, so I would have loved to have not seen anything ever again.
