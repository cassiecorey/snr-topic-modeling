Draft seed import regulations worry growers
Cut flower growers in northern Australia are renewing their calls for more time to comment on draft changes to seed import regulations.
Biosecurity Australia is reviewing the regulations, which Darwin grower Jan Hintze says will impact on flower breeding.
She says they will also make it harder to conserve species like ginger, which is under threat from timber harvesting across Asia.
"I think it's a significant role that Australia should play within its sphere of interest," she said.
"I mean these people that live in countries in South-East Asia and Asia, they are really concerned about the loss of this material too, but they can't save it all on their own.
