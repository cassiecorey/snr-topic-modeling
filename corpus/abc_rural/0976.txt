Rig demand delays geosequestration trial
Researchers say the first Australian trial of technology to try to trap greenhouse gases underground is being delayed.
The $30 million geosequestration project in south-west Victoria aims to test whether carbon dioxide from coal burning power stations and gas mining can be stored underground.
The Federal Government has funded the project as one of its preferred ways of combating climate change.
The project's leader, Dr Peter Cook, says preliminary tests are being carried out but he does not expect to be able to start pumping carbon dioxide underground until next year.
"A lot of people want to drill for oil at the moment so it's a bit hard to get rigs," he said.
"Also it's a constraint on us that costs have generally gone up.
"We're not a major company, we're a research organisation with limited funds so we have to be rather careful the way that we use those funds.
