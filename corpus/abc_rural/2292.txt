Opposition urges changes to croc laws
The Queensland Opposition is calling for legislative changes relating to capturing crocodiles and harvesting wild crocodile eggs.
Under the current system, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for the capture of problem crocodiles.
But the Oppositions environment spokeswoman Rosemary Menkins says with an increasing number of crocs, more people need to help.
"Our suggestion is - which is being asked for by the farmers - is to allow registered crocodile farmers to actually capture and relocate the problem animals," she said.
"Secondly, a change in government policy that will allow the commercial harvest of wild crocodile eggs, of course under strict guidelines."
