Gelbvieh bull takes champion award
A Gelbvieh breed of bull has been named supreme male champion at Australia's biggest stud cattle competition at Rockhampton, in Queensland.
More than 2,000 nominations across 33 breeds for the title made it the biggest stud cattle competition in Australian history.
Guyra producer Michael Jackson, who owns the winning bull "Double J Zulu", was understandably happy about the win.
"We have been showing cattle for nearly 20 years now, and we've never won anything like this," he said.
