Tas mine fire halts production
An overnight fire has stopped production at an iron ore mine in a remote area of north-east Tasmania.
The fire at the Savage River mine is believed to have started in an ore concentrator while workers were welding.
More than 40 firefighters battled the blaze, and Australian Bulk Minerals managing director, Dave Sandy, says the damage is still being assessed.
"Most of the damage is related to conveyor belts and electrical cabling, there may be some structural damage on the upper levels but on the main floor it seems to be in reasonably good shape," he said.
