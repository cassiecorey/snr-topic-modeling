Ex-NFF boss considers entering federal politics
The former president of the National Farmers Federation (NFF), Peter Corish, has confirmed he is thinking about running as a candidate in next year's federal election.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the Nationals would welcome the former leader, but Mr Corish says he is yet to make up his mind.
He believes it would be logical to run in the new New South Wales seat which incorporates the seat held by former deputy PM John Anderson.
The National party has welcomed an apparent softening in the Federal Government's plans to allow greater powers for cross-media ownership in rural areas.
Communications Minister Helen Coonan says she is prepared to listen to proposed changes to the new ownership laws, to ensure radio, television and newspapers are not owned by one company in the same region.
Nationals' MP Paul Neville says members are hoping to convince the Minister to protect rural media.
