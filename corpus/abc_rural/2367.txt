Program aims to encourage farmers to talk about depression
National organisation Beyondblue is launching a new program today it hopes will encourage farmers and rural communities to talk about depression.
The organisation is launching the first phase of its drought action plan with Incitec Pivot.
Incitec staff will be trained to recognise symptoms of depression and point people in the right direction for medical and financial help.
Incitec employee and sufferer of depression Noel Trevaskis says most staff are relieved they can offer practical support.
"If they're talking to a farmer or a farmer's wife or whoever, then they will be able to have the skills to be able to recognise those signs and symptoms," he said.
"They'll also be able to offer some help and advice as to where people can get help to see them through the problem that they're experiencing."
