New techniques found to reduce fishing deaths
A four year project has shown commercial anglers can use long lines for deep sea fishing without killing thousands of seabirds.
In the past trailing baited hooks behind trawlers in Antarctic waters has caused the deaths of up to 3,000 birds a year.
Techniques, including quickly sinking hooks and hauling them in differently, have reduced sea bird deaths to zero.
Les Scott from fishing company Petuna Sealord says other countries should follow Australia's lead.
"The statistics show that the mitigation methods work because if you look at our neighbours their bird mortality is still 2,000 plus," he said.
