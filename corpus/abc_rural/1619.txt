Mandatory horticultural code of conduct announced
The Federal Government has announced it will implement a mandatory code of conduct for the horticulture sector after grower groups rejected a voluntary proposal.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran made the announcement in the wake of a meeting last week where the National Farmers Federation and grower group AUSVEG rejected a government proposal for a voluntary but legally enforceable code of conduct.
Designed to provide more transparency for growers when it comes to selling their produce, wholesalers have already warned they will take legal action to prevent a mandatory code being implemented.
The Government has flagged growers may have to foot the bill for the cost of implementing the code.
