Marine park boundaries 'botched'
The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) wants changes to the way boundaries are established for national marine parks.
It says the new park between Tasmania and the mainland is a botched job, which fails to protect marine biodiversity.
The park's boundaries were redrawn after concerns from the fishing sector.
The MCS's Craig Bohm says the revised boundaries have missed biodiverisity hotspots, and the Federal Government must review the process.
