Land Rights Act changes please fishermen
Land rights claims over some inter-tidal areas on the Northern Territory coastline will be automatically terminated by changes to the federal Land Rights Act.
The move affects claims won more than three years ago through the High Court and has been labelled "un-Australian" by the Northern Land Council.
But Iain Smith, from the Territory's Seafood Council, has welcomed the changes.
He says some claims had big ramifications.
"If at some future stage a court decided that while water was over Aboriginal land the water and the animals in it belonged to the relevant land trust - it was freehold title - then of course we would be totally excluded from the area unless we paid a fee," he said.
