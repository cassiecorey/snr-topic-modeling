New smut fears in Qld
Tests are underway to confirm whether the disease sugar cane smut has escaped from a quarantine zone in Queensland.
The State Government is expected to announce today that scientists are testing what's being called "suspicious substance", as smut inspection teams survey 600 farms around Mackay.
Smut was first found near Bundaberg in June, and authorites had thought it was contained.
The Canegrowers Organisation is refusing to confirm that the disease has escaped quarantine, but has confirmed testing is underway.
