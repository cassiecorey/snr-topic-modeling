Graincorp backs call for end to AWB wheat export monopoly
One of the nation's biggest private grain traders has backed calls for AWB to lose its monopoly for wheat exports.
Western Australian Liberal MP Wilson Tuckey is spearheading a campaign to dismantle the single desk for wheat exports, in response to speculation that AWB will make significant trading losses this season.
Tom Keene, managing director of Graincorp, will not directly criticise AWB. But he says growers would do better if other companies were allowed to trade in export wheat.
"It would be wrong of me to comment on the AWB's hedging arrangements," he said.
"My reaction has been and continues to be that a marketplace that has more competition in it would ensure that growers could choose who they sell their grain to, just as they currently do with their other grains.
