Cyclone recovery expected to take months
In far north Queensland and the Gulf country, communities are still trying to come to terms with the impact of cyclone Larry.
The community has donated $10 million to help but the recovery will take months, if not years.
Cyclone Larry is said to have cost 4,000 jobs, many of them on farms and there is a concern young people will exodus the region in search of work.
AgForce has expressed concerns that flood affected graziers may not be able to access assistance if it is means-tested because of the increase in property valuations.
The Bundaberg Sugar Company will not open its Mourilyan mill south of Innisfail for this year's cane crush, saying Larry has drastically reduced the harvest forecasts.
Cane will be diverted to other mills and farmers calling for assistance to remove trees and debris from the orchard have been told by cyclone recovery task force coordinator General Peter Cosgrove that the Army will help if they put up a strong enough case.
"I would like those people who are suffering those frustrations and wonder if they can get urgent assistance to refer it to the incident management centre in Innisfail," he said.
Meanwhile cyclone Larry is being blamed for a temporary shortage of fish in Victorian markets.
Peter Clarke from the Lakes Entrance Fishermen's Co-op says there has been rough weather since the cyclone hit Queensland last week.
Mr Clarke says with winds of more than 30 knots, smaller trawlers are staying in port more days a week than usual.
