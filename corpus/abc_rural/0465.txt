World trade changes pose problems for fruit growers
Tasmanian apple growers are feeling the pressure of change in Australian horticulture and are hosting a meeting later this month to address their future.
Thomas Frankcomb from Fruit Growers Tasmania says the industry is at "yet another cross roads", with significant changes in global production, market prices and the threat of cheaper imported fruit.
He hopes the meeting will help growers make choices about their future and believes the issues are bigger than just one state or one sector.
