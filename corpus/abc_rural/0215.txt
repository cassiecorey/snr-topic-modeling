Cattle sales strong
Arctic conditions at the Bothwell calf sale in Tasmania yesterday did not deter cattle buyers from around Australia.
Nearly 6,000 calves were auctioned for around $3 million.
The top price for the day of $880 a head went to Ellendale graziers Greg and Tania Downham for their Hereford-Charolais steers.
Many of the calves will be shipped to Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales.
Greg Downham says prices were up on last year and the calves were in excellent condition.
"We've had an exceptional season, the best that we can remember for a long time, the spring and summer have just been something out of the box," he said.
