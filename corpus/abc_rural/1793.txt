Rejected bananas may be returned at growers' expense
More than 1,400 cartons of bananas from northern New South Wales have been rejected by Victoria and may be returned at the growers' expense.
Growers were seeking the better prices from the Melbourne market.
But the $100,000 shipment was sent without the certification needed to ensure it was not ripe and therefore safe from fruit fly.
Arthur Akehurst, from the Department of Primary Industries, says the actions breach interstate trade regulations.
"This action has endangered the arrangements we have with Victoria but I hope Victoria sees it as a one off and doesn't take further action," he said.
