Abattoir fish project likely to expand
The first attempt at growing fish in waste water from abattoirs has been successfully carried out in South Australia.
The lamb exporter, Tatiara Meat Company, uses about 1 million litres of water a day in its operations.
Most of it is recycled, but waste water held in storage ponds is now being used to grow goldfish, barramundi and carp, purifying the water so it can be used to grow fodder for livestock.
Environmental officer Fil Farina says the project is likely to expand.
