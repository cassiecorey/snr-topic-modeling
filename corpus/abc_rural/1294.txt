Govt to hear farmers' chemical access concerns
The Federal Government says it will listen to farmer concerns before deciding whether to restrict access to more agricultural chemicals in the wake of the latest terrorism threat.
There is currently a review of 84 herbicides, fungicides and fumigants.
Farmers are worried that a new licensing system being considered by the Government will make the chemicals too expensive.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says there needs to be a balance between security concerns and farming needs.
Ben Fargher, from the National Farmers Federation, is hopeful the Government can be persuaded to keep existing training and certification programs instead.
"We will sit down with government, we will explain how the current schemes work with government," he said.
"There is government involvement in this and government people I have spoken to are aware of the industry schemes.
