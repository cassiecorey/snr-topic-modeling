Authority approves canola export licences
The Grains Licensing Authority (GLA) in Western Australia has approved three small export licences for 75,000 tonnes of canola aimed at higher priced markets in Europe and the Middle East.
GLA chairman Wayne Obst says higher tonnages were not approved because crop predictions are forecast to be dismal this year.
Two applications to send malting barley to China were knocked back because of the dry conditions in the west.
Mr Obst says the authority can easily prove the restriction on export licences will benefit growers.
"These canola licences have gone to a higher priced market, that's been caused by the request for canola into the biodiesel market," he said.
