Feed grain users move to import
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has confirmed that some feed grain users are looking to import stocks for the first time since 2002.
AQIS, which approves import permits, says it has had casual discussions with users, but no formal application has been lodged.
Grain is imported when Australia's supply is low and domestic prices are dearer than international prices.
Elders general manager of grains, Phillip Pyle, says while prices are not high enough to justify importing yet, they have moved up rapidly in the past month.
"Prices are up pretty dramatically," he said.
