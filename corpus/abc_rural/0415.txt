Rates hike to hurt commodities outlook
The Reserve Bank's decision to lift interest rates is more bad news for farmers, following on from high fuel prices.
The interest rate rise, to 5.75 per cent, is the first in more than 14 months.
Senior analyst with Hartleys, Rob Brierley, says the announcement will hurt the outlook for commodities.
"Most of the commodities are priced in US dollars so it means that the seller of the commodity actually gets less in Australian dollars for it," he said.
