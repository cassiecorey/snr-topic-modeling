Third party to oversee NLIS audit
The Federal Government will appoint an independent third party to oversee an audit of the National Livestock Identification System database to address cattle producer concerns once and for all.
The Australian Beef Association lobby group feared the audit would be conducted in-house,and not effectively address its claims that the electronic livestock tagging system is not working effectively.
But Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has released the terms of reference for the 10 week audit and says he is just about to appoint a major accounting firm to run it.
He says every major group will have a say.
"The Australian Beef Association will be contacted and their concerns will be completely and fully explored," he said.
