Academic suggests water allocations for city residents
There is a call today for governments to consider water allocations for city dwellers and businesses.
Mike Young, a professor at the University of Adelaide, says there should be a minimum supply of water that is cheap and protected, with extra water available to everyone on an open market.
Professor Young says the move would drive up water prices during droughts reducing shortages and generating more money for water infrastructure, desalination and recycling projects.
"If we start having high prices in urban areas then they'll start actually making the water that they need themselves and actually recycling and doing all those other things," he said.
