Drought prompts call for seed law changes
A South Australian farmer wants the rules on Plant Breeders Rights (PBR) to be relaxed, so growers can donate seed to struggling colleagues.
New grain varieties are subject to the rules, which prohibit growers from selling or even giving away the seed.
Chris Lawrie from Tumby Bay says the seed companies should waive the ban this year, given the magnitude of the drought.
"Why can't they come out publicly and say well okay, if we either give or sell seed to somebody that we notify them of the amount of tonnes we've sold, who we've sold it to, then they've got a record of it all," he said.
