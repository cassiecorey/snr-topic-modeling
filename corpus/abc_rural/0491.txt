AWB hopes to salvage India wheat deal
Wheat exporter AWB hopes last minute talks can salvage a half million tonne wheat deal with India.
Indian authorities have raised new concerns about quality issues, this time with wheat which has not even left Australia.
The first consignment of wheat under the deal was held up last week while tests for pesticide contamination were carried out. Those tests cleared the wheat for unloading.
National pool manager with AWB David Johnson says the company is trying to limit the damage to growers, with the national pool bearing any cost of delays.
"We are looking to mitigate an exposure, cost to growers, by potentially diverting some of those vessels to other markets," he said.
