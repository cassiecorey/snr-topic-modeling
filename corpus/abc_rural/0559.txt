Private member's bill
Meanwhile Liberal MP Wilson Tuckey says he will introduce a private member's bill to Parliament to remove AWB's ability to veto other companies from exporting wheat, if the Government does not.
Mr Tuckey says it was highly predictable a deal would not be reached because the wheat wasn't sold at 'arms-length' from AWB.
He says he will talk to the Australian Grain Exporters Association today to encourage its members to lodge wheat export applications for Iraq.
But he says the Government must also act to reduce AWB's power.
"It's now necessary that the Government in its ambition to ensure that the trade is maintained to go to Brooks Grain or one of the, as some refer to them, the foreign devils, be given every opportunity to see if they can stitch up a deal and it should be the Government's, if necessary, urgent legislation to make sure that deliveries can be obtained," he said.
