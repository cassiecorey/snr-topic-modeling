Daylight saving bill introduced to WA Parliament
After years of resistance, Western Australians could have daylight saving in place by this summer.
A bill will be introduced into State Parliament today to set-up a daylight saving trial from the start of December.
If the bill is passed, a referendum will take place after three summers, in 2009.
