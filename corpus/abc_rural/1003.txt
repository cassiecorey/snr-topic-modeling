Study shows more severe droughts ahead for Aust
New research into the sun suggests eastern Australia could face more severe droughts over the next 500 years.
A study at the University of New England in New South Wales has shown a link between solar cycles and rainfall patterns, which can be used in conjunction with the southern oscillation index to more accurately predict droughts.
Associate Professor Robert Baker says fewer sunspots or cold patches on the surface of the sun may mean the eastern states are headed for drier times in the long term.
