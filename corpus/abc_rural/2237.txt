Japanese consul-general helps mark rice crop anniversary
The Japanese consul general has helped to mark the 100th anniversary of Australia's first rice crop.
Shisei Kaku has unveiled a memorial sign near Swan Hill in north-west Victoria.
He says he is proud to commemorate the time when Japanese farmer Joe Takasuka first planted a crop on flood prone land on the Murray River.
