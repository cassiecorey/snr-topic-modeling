Drought takes its toll
The drought's effect is worsening daily.
The winter grain crop in NSW is on a knife's edge and almost half of it could fail without rain in the next seven to 10 days.
The state's Primary Industries Minister, Ian Macdonald, says dry winds and no rain have combined to make the worst conditions possible.
His department is downsizing crop predictions and now expects less than 2.5 million hectares to be harvested, less than half the annual average.
