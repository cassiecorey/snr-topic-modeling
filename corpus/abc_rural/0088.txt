NT flower growers meet Games shortfall after cyclone
Cut-flower growers in the Northern Territory have had to come to the rescue of Commonwealth Games organisers, in the wake of Cyclone Larry.
The red and orange tropical heliconias are a centrepiece of the bouquets presented to medal winners, and had been provided from both north Queensland and the Territory.
Darwin growers like Jan Hintze have had to come up with more than 10,000 blooms after the Games order doubled overnight.
"I had to find another 1,000 flowers, from Monday lunchtime to Tuesday lunchtime, which is actually quite difficult," she said.
"But however, we all got together and sure enough I did manage to get them all together and they went off on Tuesday night and they will be the bouquets today and tomorrow.
