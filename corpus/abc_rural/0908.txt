Frost damage may push up avocado costs
The price of avocados could be set to rise, with significant frost damage to crops in the Murray Valley.
Freezing conditions a fortnight ago has caused fruit to drop off the trees.
John Eastoe from Mildura Agricultural Contractors says he has lost 60 per cent of his crop, which had an estimated valued of more than half a million dollars.
"We were sitting on probably our best has crop ever, we've been lifting our yields for the last three years but as you can see it's all on the ground," he said.
