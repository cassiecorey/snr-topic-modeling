Code of conduct for pig welfare criticised
The animal rights group Voiceless has criticised the Federal Government's draft code of conduct for pig welfare, claiming it is inaccurate and limits public consultation.
Voiceless says the proposed code invites the public to make submissions through a survey which restricts objections to things like sow stalls.
Spokeswoman Katrina Sharman says the code also incorrectly claims other countries have no plans to phase out sow stalls, which is inhibiting public debate.
"The regulatory impact statement which accompanies the code suggests in Denmark, which is a major competitor to Australia's pig meat market, there are no plans to phase out sow stalls," she said.
