NZ stone fruit growers get WA access
New Zealand stone fruit growers will be allowed to sell their fruit into markets in Western Australia, six years after applying for access.
Biosecurity Australia has made the decision in a risk import analysis, as long as fruit is fumigated and inspected to keep pests out of WA.
Peter Gubler from the WA Summerfruit Council says he is concerned, but does not expect imports to have a major impact, in a market where prices are already lower than in the eastern states.
"Money wise, the commodities like peaches and nectarines, I don't think they'll benefit from that because of the low return that growers here in the state get anyway," he said.
