Cotton results receed expectations
A gamble on this year's cotton crop appears to have paid off, although yields are down, and quality is mixed.
With harvest in full swing in New South Wales, the results are better than expected, despite a record-breaking summer heatwave.
Although growers in the Macquarie Valley faced almost zero water allocations at the start of the season, Auscott Macquarie planted almost 75 per cent of its normal acreage.
Managing director Chris Hogendyke says most has made it though.
"We got lots of allocation increases during the summer and the crops the crops turned out to be really good," he said.
"We're looking at about 10.5 bales per hectare average and we're very happy with the result.
