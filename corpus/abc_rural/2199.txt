Hay exporters meeting export demand
Northern Territory hay producers are taking advantage of the drought across the rest of the country to meet export demand.
Five containers of hay are on their way to Korea and Japan.
The Territory's Agricultural Association spokesman, Mal Bishop, says transport costs have stopped them developing an interstate market but there is strong interest in their tropical varieties.
"This year is a really good year to be pushing it because of the dry season down south and in the eastern states," he said.
