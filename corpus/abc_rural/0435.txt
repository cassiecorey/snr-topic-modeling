Lamb sales to Japan booming
Sales of Aussie lamb into Japan are booming, with annual growth rates of up to 70 per cent.
Japanese importer Top Trader says lamb is losing its reputation as an unpleasant smelly meat and the market is set to grow, despite looming competition from US beef.
And the good times are set to continue.
Meat and Livestock Australia's Malcolm Harvey says Russia is emerging as the next big market for lamb.
"It's not subject to any quotas, the amount of money and wealth being generated in Russia is just something that's hard for people to comprehend, and they love Australian lamb," he said.
