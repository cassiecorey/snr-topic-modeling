Maritime protected area boundaries to be announced
The Federal Government will this afternoon announce the final boundaries for marine protected areas off the Tasmanian, Victorian and South Australian coasts.
They are expected to be significantly different to the Government's initial proposal, which drew criticism from the fishing and scallop industries for being too strict.
The Tasmanian scallop sector said it would be wiped out if the areas were enforced.
