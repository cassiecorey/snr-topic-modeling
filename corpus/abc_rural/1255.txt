Wine blueprint to focus on new innovations
New innovations dominate a new seven year blueprint for the Australian wine industry which was launched in Adelaide this morning.
Compiled by the Australian Wine Research Institute, the plan looks at what consumers want from their wine, how growers and wineries can improve production and how to ease the grape glut.
Managing director Sakkie Pretorius says it will help the industry to stay competitive.
