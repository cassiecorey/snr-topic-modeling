Destructive aphid found in Yarra Valley
The destructive phylloxera aphid has been found for the first time in Victoria's prestigious Yarra Valley wine region.
Until now the aphid, which attacks the roots of vines and causes them to die, has been restricted to the state's north-east.
A small vineyard has been quarantined and neighbouring properties warned about the outbreak.
Dr Patrick Sharkey from the Department of Primary Industries says he is hopeful phylloxera will not spread into the big wine regions in the state's west.
"We've actually put special control areas in there to stop vines and bins, and machinery moving in there without cleaning," he said.
"That, along with the soil type which is not conducive to the spread of phylloxera, has helped keep those vineyards free.
