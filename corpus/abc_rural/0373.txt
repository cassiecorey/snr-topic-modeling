High Aussie dollar hurts farm profits
Economists say the rising Aussie dollar is cutting into farm returns.
The dollar has risen five cents over the past few days and overnight lifted above 75 US cents.
Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk says speculation over an interest rate rise next month has fuelled the increases.
But he says other factors are also having an impact.
"Commodity prices globally really haven't gone anywhere over the last 12 months or if anything perhaps have eased a bit," he said.
"So this strong Aussie dollar, of course, is crimping back our exporters income for the farmers and really when you are thinking about the farm sector - higher interest rates yes they will bite a bit around the margin.
"But perhaps the real significance is what we can't control and that is the rainfall out there and that is really going to be the driving factor of whether farmers have a good year or not."
The higher dollar and a large volume of wool has not helped the wool market, with sales resuming after the Easter recess.
