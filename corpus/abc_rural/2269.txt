CBH to renew export application
The Government's decision has opened the door for the CBH group to re-submit a rejected application to export wheat.
Four bids by the WA-based grain handler to send wheat to its mills in Asia have been vetoed by AWB in the past two years.
CBH chief executive Imre Mencshelyi says the company is likely to make a new attempt within days.
"I think it is a significant first step in the changing environment that we currently find ourselves in, it is our intention to re-submit our application to export 2 million tonnes of wheat to our flour mills in Asia," he said.
"Once the guidelines and details of the new power of veto become clear, I think that's important for us to understand exactly what [the] Government means by this decision."
