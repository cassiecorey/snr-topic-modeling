Japan agrees to export talks
Despite concern over the impact on its agriculture sector, Japan has agreed to discuss better access for Australian farm exports under a possible free trade agreement.
Formal talks on the trade deal will start early next year, which the Federal Government believes could be worth $39 billion to Australia over 20 years.
Trade Minister Warren Truss says Japan might push for more opportunities to sell niche products to Australia, but farmers here should receive the biggest gains.
"We are exporting a lot of beef into Japan at the present time, but all of it is paying 40 per cent or more tariffs," he said.
