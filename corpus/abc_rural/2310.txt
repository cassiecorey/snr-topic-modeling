Wine grape growers may run out of water
Some wine grape growers in South Australia's Riverland could run out of irrigation water as early as next month.
The state's Murray River irrigators are currently only able to use 60 per cent of their entitlement.
Viticulturist Peter Burne says with the ongoing dry, irrigators are using more water than usual.
"A lot of growers have already gone over 30 per cent of their total allocation for the year," he said.
