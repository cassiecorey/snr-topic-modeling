Fruit wholesaler says banana returns increasing
A leading Queensland fruit wholesaler says he is surprised that bananas are being blamed for a higher than expected rise in inflation.
Economists blame skyrocketing banana prices, as well as fuel costs, for the 1.6 per cent jump in the June quarter Consumer Price Index.
More than 90 per cent of the Australian banana crop was wiped out earlier this year when cyclone Larry hit far north Queensland.
Peter Kedwell from the Brisbane Markets says while volume is down, returns are actually up.
"Bananas [on] average used to be around $15 to $20 a box, now it's $150 a box," he said.
