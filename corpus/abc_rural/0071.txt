Anderson urges states to stand by water initiative
Former deputy prime minister John Anderson says the National Water Initiative is in danger of stalling and the states need to recommit to it.
Mr Anderson says the deal, to secure water for the environment and property rights for farmers, is months behind schedule and he is worried it is heading off target.
He has also reject suggestions that it is time for governments to buy water from farmers for the environment.
"Where they do want to enter the market in my view, they should do it as was agreed in the case of the Living Murray, as a last resort only," Mr Anderson said.
"I'm glad you asked the question because I think there's a few governments now and few people around the place thinking 'oh the easy way out of this, it's all too hard to find the savings' and I don't know what's wrong with modern governments, but they're all so reluctant to get their hands involved with infrastructure."
Malcolm Turnbull, parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, says only half the necessary water savings have been found for Murray River environmental flows.
Mr Turnbull says there may be no other option than buying water and he will put the idea to a Murray Darling Ministerial Council meeting next month.
He is rejecting suggestions that would lead to a big increase in water prices.
"There's this kind of implicit assumption that if governments are going to participate in water markets they will do so recklessly, overpaying," Mr Turnbull said.
