Kosciuszko bushfire contained
A 5,000 hectare bushfire in the Kosciuszko National Park has been contained by weekend rain but it is still a complex operation to put it out.
No property was lost in the blaze but searing temperatures and hot westerly winds swept the flames through new grasslands that had grown where the trees were burnt in the 2003 summer fires.
Incident controller Ian Stewart says firefighters will be winched into "hot spots" to put out any fires still burning in the rugged country near the snow line.
"Yesterday we had a FLIR [forward looking infra red sensor/laser range] machine come down, that's a helicopter with a forward looking infrared device which picks up hot spots," he said.
