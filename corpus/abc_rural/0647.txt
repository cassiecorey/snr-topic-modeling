Labour shortage hits northern NSW
More than 50 agricultural jobs are currently going begging on the New South Wales north coast despite unemployment there being almost double the national average.
The beef, chicken and pork industries are facing a critical shortage of labour.
Northern Co-operative Meat Company's Gary Burridge says local businesses are finding workers are turning away from the rural sector.
"We in our organisation are suffering a severe shortage of highly skilled labour and semi-skilled labour," he said.
