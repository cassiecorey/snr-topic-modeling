VFF backs change to single desk
The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) has joined the growing number of organisations calling for change to the single desk for wheat exports.
Under the VFF's plan, AWB would be forced to split to make the single desk more accountable.
AWB International would retain its monopoly on exporting wheat from the national pool, but the domestic arm, AWB Limited, would lose any commercial influence over exports.
Grains Group president Ian Hastings is looking for support from the peak Grains Council of Australia.
"The sort of things that are in our discussion paper, in our model, are the sorts of things that are absolutely dear to all growers around Australia," he said.
