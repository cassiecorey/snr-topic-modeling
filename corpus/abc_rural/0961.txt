Climate change threatens blackcurrant industry
There is a warning today that Tasmania's niche blackcurrant industry is under threat from global warming.
Plant pathologist Steve Wilson says there has been a progressive drop in yields over the past 15 years because of a sharp increase in extremely cold nights.
Mr Wilson is trialing other black currant varieties in an attempt to boost yields, but says he is not hopeful.
"This, I think, may be the canary in the coal mine," he said.
"It is showing that climate change can impact on commercial crops.
"w We've often thought of climate change as something that can impact on natural populations, but here it is having quite a distinct impact, quite a distinct economic one, on a small industry."
