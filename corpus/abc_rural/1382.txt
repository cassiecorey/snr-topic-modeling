Dry conditions boost cattle, sheep sales
A growing number of farmers in the south-eastern states are selling off cattle due to dry seasonal conditions and low water allocations.
Saleyard prices dropped sharply yesterday as lower-quality dairy and beef cattle flooded into the market
Aaron Iori, from the National Livestock Reporting Service, says stock figures are dramatically higher than last year.
"If you look at south-east South Australia for instance, numbers there are about 80 per cent higher than this time last year," he said.
"That's specifically because the area north of Naracoote is in a severe situation and numbers are just continuing to come on to the market."
More sheep are also appearing in the saleyards because the dry winter has left many farms without feed.
Extra sales are being run in some places to cater for the higher numbers.
Gary Tapscott, from Elders, says the dry conditions are affecting everyone.
