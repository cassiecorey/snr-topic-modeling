Study looks at heat stress concerns for helmet wearers
Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) is studying how heat stress might affect station workers forced to wear helmets while riding horses.
Graziers across northern Australia have raised concerns that compulsory helmet wearing for employees could increase body temperature and lead to heat stress and fatigue.
With some stations forcing the introduction of helmets as a safety measure, MLA's Wayne Hall hopes the research will lead to better helmet designs.
