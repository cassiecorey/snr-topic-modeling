Cattle Council, RSPCA talk welfare
In a new approach to addressing animal welfare issues, the Cattle Council has held talks with the RSPCA for the first time.
The meeting is part of an animal welfare roundtable at the Cattle Council's executive meeting in Hobart.
President Bill Bray says the livestock industry can improve its image by working with groups which are trusted by the public.
"RSPCA does have that respect, they have some views that are contrary to ours but we have to engage them and we have to get smarter at how we engage them and engage the community," he said.
