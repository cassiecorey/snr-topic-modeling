River flows reach low levels
River flows in Tasmania have reached their lowest levels since records began 40 years ago.
Terry Leary from the Department of Primary Industries says record low winter rainfall across most of the state has also meant that many farmers have not been able to fill farm dams.
He says it is also unusual that the dry conditions are affecting the entire state, even the usually high rainfall region of the state's north-west.
