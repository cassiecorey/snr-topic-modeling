Farmers rush to sell off cattle
Southern New South Wales and Victorian livestock markets are overflowing as farmers sell off their cattle.
Producers say they cannot hold onto cattle until after the Christmas break because of severe water restrictions in the southern Riverina.
Nicole Varley from the National Livestock Reporting Service says as a result markets could resume earlier than usual next year.
"Everyone's now talking whether or not they are going to go back straightaway after New Year's or whether they'll hold back," she said.
