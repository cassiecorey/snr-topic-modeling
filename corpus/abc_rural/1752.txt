High quality wool a hit at Sydney, Melbourne markets
The sale of high quality ultrafine wool in Melbourne and Sydney was the highlight of a fairly lacklustre week in the wool market.
A top price of 65,500 cents a kilogram was paid at the Sydney sales, with Italian buyers dominating the bidding.
On a wider note, the eastern market indicator fell two cents to 737 cents a kilogram clean.
More than 65,000 bales will be offered next week, including 5,000 bales from New Zealand.
