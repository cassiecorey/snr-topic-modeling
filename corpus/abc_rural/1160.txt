Qld police investigate crop sabotage
North Queensland police are investigating the sabotage of crops in the horticulture district of Bowen.
Crops have been deliberately poisoned on four farms, causing a million dollars' damage to paddocks of watermelons, beans, tomatoes and capsicums.
Bowen company Queensland Seedlings lost thousands of plants in a similar attack in 2002, and no one has ever been charged.
Spokesman Andrew Paterson supplies seedlings to some of the affected farmers and says the damage has created a lot of fear and uncertainty.
"Basically someone out there, or persons, or person, I don't know, is holding us all to ransom," he said.
