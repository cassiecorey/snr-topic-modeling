Oil companies deny collusion claims
Australia's oil companies have told a Senate inquiry they are not colluding with each other to manipulate prices.
Caltex is appearing before the petrol pricing inquiry in Canberra today, while BP has also made a submission.
Caltex's chief executive Des King says the company only makes a profit of 2.2 cents after tax on each litre of fuel sold.
He has told senators that competition, not collusion, is the main driver for setting petrol prices.
"It is very important to people who operate petrol stations to have high-volume traffic through their station because if somebody finds that if their traffic through their station is low, they will then follow the price down, if somebody's already led the price down, to get their volume back up, because this is very much a low margin, high volume kind of business," he said.
Committee member, Senator Andrew Murray, says it is unlikely collusion is taking place between the oil companies.
