McGauran joins push to lift ban on GM crops
There is growing pressure on the states to lift their bans on commercial trials of genetically modified (GM) crops.
State governments have powers over land which they have used to impose the bans.
Now federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has joined farm groups in calling for the moratoria to be lifted, saying there are environmental and economic benefits from the technology.
"I believe the states' opposition to genetically modified crops is purely philosophical or ideological, it makes no economic or environmental sense," he said.
"Farmers should make the decision for themselves based on their reading of the marketplace.
