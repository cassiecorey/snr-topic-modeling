Livestock producers warned over feeding requirements
The Western Australian Department of Agriculture is warning livestock producers to either reduce sheep numbers or pay closer attention to feeding requirements.
There is a severe lack of feed due to dry weather and stock deaths have been reported because sheep are not getting enough roughage.
Veterinary officer Marnie Thomas says producers are feeding their sheep lupins as an alternative feed source but they need greater diversity to maintain condition.
"If you've got stock that you can quit, I would definitely be quitting them now because if this dry keeps going, you're going to be looking at supplementary feeding for anywhere up to six weeks from the break of the season, right up to eight weeks, depending on what sort of pasture you've got," she said.
