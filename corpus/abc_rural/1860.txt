Compo for Murray Valley irrigators ruled out
The New South Wales Government has ruled out compensation for Murray Valley irrigators affected by water cut backs.
High security allocations and carry over water in the Murray Valley have been cut by 20 per cent because of record low inflows.
The Natural Resources Minister, Ian Macdonald, says the water will be paid back in future, so there is no need for compensation.
He says more measures to help the farming community will be announced in the next fortnight.
