SA farmers help fire ravaged neighbours
Farmers in South Australia's south-east are donating truckloads of hay to their neighbours across the border in the wake of the Grampians bushfires.
In just a few days, farmers have donated 250 tonnes of hay, as well as agistment for cattle.
They say that is just the beginning.
Fodder drive coordinator Peter O'Conner says he has been overwhelmed by the response.
"All the hay that's going this week has all gone from places that have donated one load or up to two loads of hay," he said.
"We've got one man that's donated two full loads and the rest are all one loads, straight loads that we're moving this week.
