Hunters dismiss fox fight call
A call from the Tasmanian Government for community help to hunt down foxes has been dismissed as a public relations stunt by professional hunters.
With the discovery of a dead fox in the northern midlands a few days ago, the Government wants a task force of more than 100 people to track down the pest.
But Peter Dark from the Field and Game Association says it is an old idea that did not work first time around.
"It's all very well to say 'we'll get a hundred hunters'," he said.
