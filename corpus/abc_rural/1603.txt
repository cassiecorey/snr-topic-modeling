Pastoralists urged to diversify for future success
A gathering of pastoralists in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia has been told they need to diversify to shore up their future.
Pastoralists have met in Carnarvon at the third Gascoyne Muster to debate climate change, farm succession and how the industry will look in 2030.
Pastoralist Justin Steadman from Wooromel Station is one of those who have made the shift, with an agriculture and horticulture business about 120 kilometres south of Carnarvon.
"We can carry on doing what we're doing and with a bit of luck and change in management, I believe we can do it well and it will be quite fruitful," he said.
