Farmers still want access to Snowy Hydro documents
Farmers still want access to confidential information about water releases from Snowy Hydro, despite the collapse of plans to sell the electricity scheme.
Last week the New South Wales Government promised to let a delegation of farmers see documents relating to when water is released for irrigation.
Within 24 hours the Federal Government had withdrawn from the sale and it was abandoned.
Chairman of Southern Riverina Irrigators Ted Hatty says farmers will hold the State Government to its promise.
