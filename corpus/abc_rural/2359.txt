Farmers turn to Malaysia for cheap fodder
Dairy processor Murray Goulburn is looking to our northern neighbours for fodder to help farmers feed their cows.
The first shipment of palm kernel extract from Malaysia is due in mid-January.
The extract is a by-product of the palm oil industry, and is made up of ground and dried skins, and the flesh of the palm kernel.
Ross Greenaway from Murray Goulburn says the rising price of grain makes the extract a cheaper option for farmers.
"This first load of palm kernel is $220 plus GST plus freight. That is very cost effective compared to the current price of grain," he said.
