Aust to help improve Vietnamese industries
An Australian man has been appointed to help improve Vietnam's dairy and beef industries.
Vietnam's 25,000 dairy farmers have only four cows each on average.
Over the next five years, John Hopkins from Swan Hill will select 9,000 Australian cows for export to help boost herd numbers.
He will also help to establish a dairy training facility at the National Institute of Animal Husbandry in Saigon.
"They are really struggling with it and they are getting so many things wrong," he said.
