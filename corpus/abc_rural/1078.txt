Cape York Peninsula: the ideal training ground?
Some Cape York Peninsula cattle producers believe far north Queensland properties offer the ideal training ground for young trainees into the industry and they are appealing to the Government to support some sort of subsidised training scheme.
The big side benefit would be properties could access much needed workers for dry season mustering.
Yesterday Greg Jenkins, from Strathburn Station, brought up the problem of workers and how hard it is to recruit young people to cattle properties in far north Queensland.
The problem is young people can earn more money elsewhere and compared to previous generations, Mr Jenkins believes the youth of today are less inclined to work in remote areas.
Jay Willmann's family runs Yarraden station near Coen but they have only been there three years after coming up from central Queensland.
Mr Willmann says on Cape York Peninsula properties the work is intense, varied and exciting so young people learn the ropes a lot quicker than down south.
"I worked in central Queensland a lot, all over stations," he said.
"The biggest thing is they didn't have the variety of work that we have up here.
