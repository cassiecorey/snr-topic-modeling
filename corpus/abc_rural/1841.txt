US vows not to compete over Japanese beef market
The United States beef industry has pledged to try to expand the Japanese beef market, rather than take market share from Australia.
Australia is currently hosting beef producers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and New Zealand for the annual five nation beef talks.
The president of the US National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Mike John, says they would rather grow a contracted Japanese beef market than compete against Australia.
"I don't really look at it as a competitive issue, I think that the entire beef consumption is down in Japan - I mean regardless of where the beef comes from," he said.
