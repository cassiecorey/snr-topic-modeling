Goat meat processor seeks more overseas workers
The meat processing industry is negotiating with the Immigration Department about the use of overseas workers.
The nation's largest goat meat processor, Neil Duncan of Charleville in Queensland, says he needs more overseas workers if he is to stay in operation.
But Mr Duncan says the department has stopped processing applications for skilled workers under the 457 visa program.
"The Immigration Department needs to recognise that the meat industry does need skilled workers," he said.
"We can source skilled workers from overseas. They are there waiting and unless they actually start processing our applications, the meat industry in Australia is going backwards.
"We've got to the stage now where we're turning away livestock. We can't process livestock because we just don't have the people to be able to do it."
