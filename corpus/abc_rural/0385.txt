Crop planting to follow weekend rain
Despite the high diesel prices, crop planting is expected to get into full swing across much of Victoria and South Australia this week after good weekend rain.
Most of South Australia's growing areas had rain and there were also falls of between 44 and 30 millimetres across northern Victoria.
Victorian talkback caller Shirley is certainly relieved.
"We've had 51 millimetres. We had one of those scattered thunderstorms. We were actually away for the day and we got home here at about 6:00pm and the further we came towards home, there was more water and we got home and there was just water everywhere," she said.
