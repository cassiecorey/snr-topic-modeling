Snail forces citrus shipment redirection
A brown snail the size of a pin head has been found in a shipment of Australian citrus fruit being exported to the United States.
It is the second year in a row that a snail from a packing shed in the Sunraysia region has been found by US quarantine officials.
Peter Walker, from exporter Riversun, says somehow the snail slipped through local quarantine procedures.
The affected fruit will now have to be sold to another country.
