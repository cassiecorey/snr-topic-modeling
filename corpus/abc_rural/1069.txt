'Shear' hard work pays off for Aussies in Canada
Australia has beaten the world at an international sheep shearing competition at the Calgary Stampede in Alberta, Canada.
The Australian team of Rob Glover, from Bothwell in Tasmania and Jason Wingfield, from Victoria, beat New Zealand, the United States and Canada in a test match series over two days at Canada's biggest agricultural show, which attracts more than 1.3 million people.
Mr Glover said it was great to get a win over the highly favoured Kiwis.
