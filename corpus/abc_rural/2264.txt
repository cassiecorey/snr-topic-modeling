'Slots' may accelerate fires, says researcher
A bushfire researcher says slots or super dry air which reaches the earth's surface from a high altitude may have accelerated some of Australia's worst fires.
Dr Graham Mills is investigating the phenomenon in relation to the fatal bushfire on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula in 2005 and the Canberra fires of 2003.
He says satellite imagery has revealed a dry slot moving towards Canberra on the day the blaze hit the city.
"My hope would be that we would have some hours of warning for at least some of these events," he said.
