EPA defends Burrup gas project go-ahead
The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in Western Australia has defended its decision to approve the development of the Pluto Liquefied Natural Gas project on the Burrup Peninsula.
Major oil and gas producer Woodside wants to build a processing facility on the north-west peninsula, which houses what is believed to be the world's biggest collection of aboriginal rock art.
The Greens are outraged at the EPA's decision, and are calling on the state and federal governments to block the development.
But EPA chairman Wally Cox says the project is unlikely to compromise environmental or cultural objectives.
"The company has been very responsible in the way it's negotiated with the local Indigenous people," he said.
"It's changed its proposal on the way through to accommodate any concern the Aboriginal communities had.
