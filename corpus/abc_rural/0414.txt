Tests clear Australian wheat shipment
Authorities in India have now cleared a shipment of Australian wheat, just two days after claiming it contained an unacceptable level of pesticide.
A second round of tests has found no contamination in the 50,000 tonne consignment, which is being unloaded at the port of Chennai.
AWB's Peter McBride says the company is not yet sure what caused the mix-up.
"AWB has been officially informed that the wheat has been fully cleared by Indian authorities and the shipment is currently unloading at Chennai in India," he said.
"We had some meetings late yesterday, we'll obviously have further meetings today but the good news is the wheat has been cleared."
