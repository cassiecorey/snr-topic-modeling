ALP leadership ballot to clear the air: Beazley
Federal Opposition agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor is among Labor MPs who may have to fight for their positions during a party leadership ballot on Monday.
Labor leader Kim Beazley has called the ballot amid renewed speculation about his future.
There has been talk about Mr O'Connor's future since he lost Labor preselection for the Victorian seat of Corio earlier this year.
Mr Beazley says he wants Monday's vote to include all positions, so the frontbench is secure in the run to next year's election.
