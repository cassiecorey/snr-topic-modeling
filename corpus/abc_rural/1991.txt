AWB cuts wheat pool management costs
Wheat exporter AWB has slashed its costs for managing the national wheat pool this financial year.
The company says it is an attempt to maximise returns to grain growers during the drought and reduce administrative costs.
The base fee AWB charges for managing the pool will be cut by 40 per cent to $39.5 million.
Chairman of AWB International Ian Donges says the new business model will benefit growers.
"It means the cost per tonne will come under $10, providing we get four million tonnes," he said.
"I think that's a very good result given that in the last drought in 2002 that $10 per tonnes was around about the base rate that growers paid as well.
