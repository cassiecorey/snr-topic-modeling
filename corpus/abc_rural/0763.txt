ALP figures back compulsory ethanol levels in fuel
The push to mandate ethanol levels in petrol has a new ally - the ALP, with key Labor figures in New South Wales and Queensland said to be pushing for a 10 per cent biofuel component in fuels.
A motion to that effect was unanimously passed at the NSW Labor conference last weekend..
The Labor move comes as the federal National Party leadership heads in the opposite direction, ruling out any compulsory standards being adopted despite a good deal of backbench and National Party support for biofuels.
The Government doesn't support mandating of alternative fuel because we believe that would have a very likely if not certain market distortionary effect," said Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran.
But NSW Labor MP for Bathurst, Gerard Martin, thinks the move to mandate ethanol levels in fuel is a "no brainer".
He says pressure is being brought to bear on Kim Beazley and the Federal Opposition to get behind a cleaner, cheaper renewable fuel.
