Livestock transporters fear for future
Some livestock transporters fear they will be forced to leave the industry because of the drought.
Transporters, who face hundreds of thousands of dollars in operational costs, were not included in the Federal Government's recent $700 million drought package.
President of the Livestock Transporter's Association Mark Sullivan says while operators have been kept busy carting thousands of drought affected sheep and cattle, that will soon slow down as stock numbers dwindle.
"I was speaking to a couple of Victorian members, they reckon their workload is fairly hectic, but what they're worried about is when it comes [during] January and February, when the impact of it happens, what they're going to do next," he said.
