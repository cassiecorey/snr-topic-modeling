Farmers prevent vegetation clearing inspection
About 200 farmers have blockaded a property near the New South Wales town of Cobar, in a sign of growing anger at the state's native vegetation regulations.
The farmers stopped government officials inspecting the property yesterday, where legal clearing of invasive native scrub is under way.
The Wilderness Society is believed to have complained about the scrub removal.
Community spokesman Stuart Mosley says the farmer who owned the property did not have anything to hide, but local producers have had enough.
"We've got a family who is highly respected, who is held up by the Catchment Management Authority as being model land managers," he said.
"We have got the radical greens on the other side who are evangelically opposed to land clearing.
"We don't believe that is appropriate for our part of the state.
"Yesterday we stood in the middle of 12.5 million hectares of invasive native scrub land that ABARE [Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics] has identified as being at risk because of inappropriate native vegetation regulation.
