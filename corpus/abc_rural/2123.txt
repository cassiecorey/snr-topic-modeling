French judge praises Australian wine quality
A French wine writer who is judging at the National Wine Show in Canberra has praised the quality of Australian wine.
The premium show only takes wines that have previously won gold and silver medals.
Michel Bettane has 15,000 wines in his a bulging cellar and believes Australian wines are improving every year.
"I think the average quality is higher for the best wines because the wines are more precise, more elegant and perhaps more complex," he said.
