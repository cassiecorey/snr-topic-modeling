US wheat forecast continues to drop
The US wheat production forecast continues to slide but there has been a sharp rise in grain prices.
The latest US Agriculture Department wheat estimate is off another 5 million bushels from last month at 1.8 billion.
But that is just a small decline compared with the 14 per cent drop so far from the last marketing year.
USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board chairman Gerald Bange says the bigger story is a 20 cent price increase on tightening competitor production in Argentina, Canada and the EU.
"EU-25, in particular, was down pretty sharply," he said.
"We can down 6.8 million tons on our estimate of their 06/07 crop and the reason for that is they were hit really hard by some real extreme heat in June and July."
