Grape growers, orchardists prepare for NSW cold snap
Grape growers and orchardists in the central New South Wales ranges are preparing for a predicted cold snap over the next two days.
Sub-zero temperatures are being tipped, which could bring further frosts, which caused damage to apples, cherries and grapevines two weeks ago.
Angullong grapegrower James Crossing has bought a spray which he hopes can limit frost damage.
"Well currently we are just mapping out low-lying areas of the vineyard to determine the areas that are likely to be damaged by frost, then we will be spraying with a polymer spray to protect those vines from the cold weather," he said.
"We are looking at about $400 a hectare for the chemical and application and we are looking at doing ten to fifteen hectares."
