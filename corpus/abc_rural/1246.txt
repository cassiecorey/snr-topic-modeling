Stellar season boosts machinery dealers confidence
One of the best seasons in years in South Australia has machinery dealers confident of big sales at this year's Eyre Peninsula Field Days.
High fuel prices and low commodities have not deterred thousands from attending the biggest event on every farmers calendar in South Australia.
The Eyre Peninsula Field Days plays host to more than 650 sites of large machinery and rural supplies along the outskirts of the small town of Cleve, one-and-a-half hours north of Port Lincoln.
The season in this part of the world has been treated well, with some saying it is one of the best they have seen. Others claim the stem rust could be the downfall of this year's crop.
