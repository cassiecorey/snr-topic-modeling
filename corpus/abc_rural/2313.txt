NSW farm wins imported mushrooms anti-dumping case
A three-year anti-dumping case on imported mushrooms has now been resolved in favour of an Australian processor.
The Federal Government has upheld its decision to put anti-dumping measures in place against Chinese tinned mushrooms.
Michael Leahy, from Windsor Farms in central New South Wales, says his company is now considering action on dumped tomatoes, potatoes and corn but has urged the Federal Government to speed up the complaints process.
"What it needs is clarification and some administrative changes inside the Act under which they operate," he said.
"But also it probably needs to be resourced sufficiently to conduct the investigations quickly enough.
