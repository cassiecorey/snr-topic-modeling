Frosts may halve crop production
Unseasonal frosts in Queensland's cropping region could halve production for some broadacre farmers.
Below average temperatures on Friday brought frosts and even snow to some parts of the Granite Belt in the state's south.
Crop specialist Paul McIntosh says while they're still assessing the damage, it already appears significant.
"There's sorghum, grain sorghum, corn, forage sorghum and even the feed values like Dolichos lablab, and some of those softer crops they are absolutely black, and the Eastern Downs is definitely the big area that's been hit," Mr McIntosh said.
