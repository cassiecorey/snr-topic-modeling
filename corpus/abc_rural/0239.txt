Victorian takes out young auctioneers award
A 24-year-old Victorian auctioneer has won the National Young Auctioneers Championship.
Adam Mountjoy from Mansfield in Victoria's Alpine region received the highest score after being judged on diction, presentation and manner during a sale of four steers at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.
He says it is very rewarding after working so hard to prepare for the competition.
"Just going through previous videos and competitions that have been held and I guess analysing and picking out the good points and some of the better things to do or try, and do on the day," he said.
