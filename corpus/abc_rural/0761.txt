Incoming farm leader wants united voice for agriculture
Building a united voice for agriculture and raising the community's awareness of farming are just two of the aims for newly elected National Farmers Federation president, David Crombie.
Mr Crombie, a businessman and former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia, says the NFF's role is to push the farming agenda with government, and emphasise the importance of agriculture to the economy.
He says targeting falling memberships amongst farm organisations is also critical.
"We can't afford division, we can't afford confusing messages coming out of agriculture," he said.
"Look, I'd like to see all farm organisations members of NFF, but once again you have to create a valued proposition for those people, if a producer feels that there's no value in being a member of an organisation then he won't join, quite simply. I think the challenge for farm organisations and for NFF is to create that value proposition."
Outgoing President Peter Corish says the NFF's biggest challenge is to deal with the weak financial position of the organisation's farm body members.
