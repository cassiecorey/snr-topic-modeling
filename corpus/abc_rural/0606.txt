AWB to boost payments to growers
In some good news for the wheat industry, AWB Limited has increased the amount of money it will pay growers next year to reflect a big jump in world grain prices.
The National Pool Price is up $15 a tonne, at $220 for the benchmark Australian premium white wheat.
That is $32 higher than the current harvest price.
AWB's National Pools manager David Johnson says the move has been fuelled by a poorer crop outlook in the US, and higher investment in the futures market by hedge fund speculators.
"While futures have been rallying the cash market for wheat has not been reflecting that full rally in prices and this is one of the major reasons why we have a number of people saying the pools aren't going up as much as they could have and that is because the cash wheat market internationally has not gone up as much as the futures markets are reflecting," he said.
"Stocks continue to tighten, that certainly augurs well for prices as we move forward."
