Rock lobster fishermen to hang up pots
Rock lobster fishermen in Western Australia will today pull their pots for the last time this season.
Most believe this year's catch was down slightly, but prices are the best they've seen in years.
Dongara fisherman Greg Cole says he will enjoy his break over the next four months.
"We're finishing on $32 a kilo which is a lot better than how we started," he said.
