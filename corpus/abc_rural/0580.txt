AWB profit rises despite scandal
Despite the oil-for-food inquiry and a sliding share price, wheat handler AWB has delivered a strong half-year result.
AWB admits it is in a difficult operating environment but its profit is up 5 per cent to $86 million before tax.
Profits have been boosted by a strong performance from the national pool, as well as business outside the wheat trade.
The Cole inquiry has cost almost $10 million so far.
The final bill is expected to total $18 million, as long as there are no extensions.
While happy with the returns, chairman Brendan Stewart says the company is determined to restore its reputation.
"I think what this demonstrates is that while we're in challenging times, that AWB is a very resilient business and we've got a good foundation for the future," Mr Stewart said.
Mr Stewart has reaffirmed the company's plans to separate AWB Limited from its international export arm.
"This is a clear direction from the board that we are prepared to make changes that deliver security and certainty to the single desk," he said.
AWB's results also divulge a payout worth more than $1 million to former managing director Andrew Lindberg.
Mr Stewart has refused to confirm any planned changes to management until after the Cole inquiry hands down its findings.
