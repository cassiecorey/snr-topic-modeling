Grain audit under consideration
The Federal Agriculture Minister says he will consider an annual national audit of grain stocks.
The Grains Council has called for the audit to address uncertainty about the level of grain held in storage.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics is currently investigating this year's dramatically drought-reduced stocks.
Peter McGauran says with ongoing uncertainty over how much grain will be available for export or domestic livestock feed this year, the Government is continuing to process 40 applications to import grain.
