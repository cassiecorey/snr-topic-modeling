Durum wheat production cut
The dry weather and crown rot disease have forced South Australia's durum wheat production to be cut dramatically this season.
Durum is used is making pasta.
Estimates are down from last year's 180,000 tonnes to just 40,000 tonnes.
Michael Jaeschke, president of the SA Durum Growers Association, says the crop estimates will continue to decline as harvesting begins.
"Unfortunately durum seems to be the first one to go out in a dry season like this," he said.
"There's a lot of durum on the ground now that's been cut down for hay and what's left there is really struggling to form any sort of grain.
