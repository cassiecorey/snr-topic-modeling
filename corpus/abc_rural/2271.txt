Barley growers divided over market deregulation
Barley growers in South Australia are at odds over plans to deregulate the state's barley market.
A review has recommended the single desk held by ABB Grain be phased out over the next three years, despite a ballot of growers showing overwhelming support for the current system.
Talkback callers to the ABC have been mixed in their response.
"I just can't comprehend that concept, I think we're in for a big loss with our barley industry if this new concept goes ahead," one caller said.
"Well what a big day, December 5, 2006, the end of the stupid single desk for barley in South Australia," another caller said.
