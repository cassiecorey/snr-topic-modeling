Drought relief package changes expected
The Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile, is expected to announce another major drought relief package next week, extending assistance to more farmers, their families and rural businesses.
The package is expected to bring Federal Government drought spending to more than $2 billion.
The Federal Government says further changes to its drought relief package will mean thousands more farmers in more regions will become eligible for exceptional circumstances drought assistance.
It is already encouraging the South and Western Australian state governments to apply for EC status.
It has also listened to calls from Coalition backbenchers for help for farm-related businesses, extra measures to combat rural depression and more emergency assistance for rural families.
