Economic forecaster criticised for livestock price estimates
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) is again under fire for its forecasts, this time for livestock prices.
Analysts say meat price estimates are probably too low, while production forecasts for beef and lamb are too high.
Bill Cordingley from Rabobank says the beef figures have not taken poor seasons properly into account.
