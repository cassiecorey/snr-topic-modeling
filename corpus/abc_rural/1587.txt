Graziers asked to keep stock off remnant native bush
The dry conditions and high cost of feeding livestock have prompted calls for livestock producers to resist the temptation to graze sheep and cattle on remnant native bush.
Tim Jury from the South Australian Nature Conservation Society says even a little grazing can do substantial damage.
While sympathising with drought-affected farmers, he is asking them to consider the long term picture.
"Dry times are tough on everyone financially and a lack of green feed is no doubt the reason why primary producers will put stock in native vegetation remnants," he said.
