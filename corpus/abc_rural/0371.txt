Murray River irrigators to sell water to Govt
The Federal Government will buy back water from Murray River irrigators to meet its targets for environmental flows.
Irrigators will be able to apply to sell water they have saved through improved on-farm infrastructure.
It is designed to help supply 500 gigalitres of water under the Living Murray Initiative.
Parliamentary Secretary for water policy Malcolm Turnbull says the tender process will be put forward at the next ministerial council meeting.
