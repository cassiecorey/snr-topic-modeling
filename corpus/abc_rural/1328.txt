Scientists map DNA sequence for bovine animals
Scientists have finished a five-year project to build a genetic map of bovine animals, which is expected to lead to better cattle production, breeding and disease control.
The $70 million project to map the DNA sequence is a joint effort between Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.
Dr Chris Prideaux from the CSIRO says it is now time to apply the science.
"Really this map will speed up the roll-out of things like genetic markers, such traits as meat tenderness [and] for marbling," he said.
