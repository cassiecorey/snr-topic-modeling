Shareholders expected to launch class action against AWB
A class action by shareholders against monopoly wheat exporter AWB is expected within weeks.
Investors will seek compensation from AWB, alleging the company did not report its activities truthfully.
The Cole Inquiry has spent the past four months investigating AWB's actions under the oil for food program in Iraq.
Ben Slade from Maurice Blackburn Cashman, says the class action will raise a number of issues.
"The most extraordinary positive act of misleading conduct we think is October 27 when the company issued a statement to the stock exchange after the Volcker suggestion was made in 2005 that the company may have been involved in sanctions busting," he said.
"The company made a statement to the stock exchange that it was not. Well that's another course of action that is even more powerful."
AWB shares have defied stockmarket trends to gain ground this week, despite the Reserve Bank's decision to lift interest rates.
AWB stocks fell considerably during the Cole inquiry, but yesterday gained 5 per cent.
Stockbrocker Matthew Baker says the prospect of more trade with India is behind the gains.
"But basically AWB has got on with its job and it's gone out there and it looks like it's going to win more business in India which is basically ship more product out the door," he said.
"Their price will vary because of the currency side but they're happy because they're going to be selling a lot more stock."
The Indian Government is expected to announce a tender for 3 million tonnes of wheat within a week.
Soaring domestic prices and a lower than expected crop are putting pressure on Indian authorities to provide enough wheat for the population.
