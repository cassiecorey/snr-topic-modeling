Grain growers won't oppose removal of AWB's wheat veto
The Grains Council says it would not oppose any move by the Federal Government to remove AWB's veto on wheat export applications.
There is a push from within the Government to take away the veto to allow other grain companies to export wheat.
But chairman of the peak body, Murray Jones, says growers must be consulted before any major structural changes are made to the single desk.
"We don't know what the Government's reaction will be and I'm leaving it open to them to make their reaction," Mr Jones said.
"We've consulted regularly and continuously during the course of the last few months and we'll continue to do so, and continue to put forward the growers' position, which is they wish to retain a single desk and they want to be consulted if there are to be any changes."
The Grains Council says it wants growers to have control of the export system.
But the Australian Grain Exporters Association is pushing the Federal Government to remove the single desk.
The association of bulk grain handlers wants an interim licensing system put in place to smooth the way for deregulation.
