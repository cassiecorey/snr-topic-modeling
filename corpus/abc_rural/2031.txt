Grain-fed cattle numbers down
The number of grain-fed cattle in Australia fell by nearly 60,000 head in the last quarter, due to skyrocketing grain prices and the worsening drought.
Figures from the Australian Lot Feeders Associations show a drop in total numbers from 940,000 to just over 880,000, with the biggest drop in Queensland.
Association president Malcolm Foster says South Australia was the only state to buck the trend, with numbers jumping 10,000 to 27,000.
"There's a lot of cattle that have come out of feedlots that have gone to profitable markets. Not all of them have been replaced," he said.
"If feedlots can't make the sums work between the price they can get for the cattle when they're turning off, and the price they've got to pay for the cattle coming in with the current grain price, then they'll just slow up their purchases of cattle and so you'll see reduced demand and the ultimate outcome of that is falling cattle prices."
Meanwhile, Tasmania's only feedlot is looking to import two thirds of its grain this year due to the poor growing season.
The Powranna feedlot usually buys more than 20,000 tonnes of grain from Tasmanian growers, but after frosts and a dry season less than half that amount is available.
Managing director Andrew Thompson says the company is looking to the mainland to make up the shortfall.
