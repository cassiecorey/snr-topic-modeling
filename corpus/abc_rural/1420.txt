Horticulture code delays anger growers
Fruit and vegetable growers are becoming increasingly angry at delays to their promised code of conduct.
Two years ago the Federal Government pledged a mandatory code to improve transparency between growers and wholesalers.
A group of north Queensland growers issued an ultimatum last week in an attempt to force the Government to confirm whether the code will be mandatory or voluntary.
Atherton Tablelands fruit grower Scott Dixson says it is a disgrace that the deadline has passed and they still have not heard from the Government.
"You tell me what other business sends away their total annual production to a third-party not knowing what financial return they will receive and no legal right of documented evidence of what it in fact sold for?" he said.
"The New South Wales Farmers Association have already gone to press over this issue and they have actually accused the Government of holding it up, surely because of the Queensland election."
Queensland Nationals Senator Ron Boswell says he understands growers' frustrations, but he cannot make any promises.
