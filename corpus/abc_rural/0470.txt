Dingoes may be used to sniff out cane toads
Enlisting dingoes is the latest suggestion to help keep Western Australia free of cane toads.
Dog trainer Sarah Fyffe has applied for a licence to use dingoes as sniffer dogs at the border and in bushland between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
She says dingoes are naturals for the outdoor job,
"We're not talking about working in a building, we're not talking about working in an airport, we're talking about working in rugged terrain," she said.
"[It is] very unforgiving - and where's the dingo from? That's its natural habitat and they cope brilliantly with it and know how to handle the elements."
