Drought-stricken farmers disappointed with Govt response
Victorian farmers facing water shortages say are disappointed with the State Government's latest plan to tackle the drought.
Premier Steve Bracks will head up a task force to consider how to deal with the drought and lack of water, and has announced more funding for rural financial counselling services.
Mallee farmer Claire Cook has had to sell most of her sheep, and says most of her crops have died.
"It's a very political, very politician's response, as in, 'we'll have a look and we'll have a discussion about it'," she said.
"I was hoping for something a bit more practical, as in some subsidies, maybe for some tanks that we're all going to have to buy in order for the water, hopefully that will be carted to us, or that we'll cart ourselves.
