Deadline for Wool Poll vote
Today is the last chance for wool growers to vote on the level of their industry levy.
Wool Poll is run every three years to determine funding levels for research and development, marketing and grower services.
Growers currently pay a levy of 2 per cent of the value of their wool sales, valued at around $60 million.
