Dairy industry fights fat perceptions
The dairy industry says growing concern over Australia's high obesity rates is turning the public off its products.
Dairy Australia is fighting back with a $4 million campaign to dispel the myth that dairy foods are fatty.
Spokesman Richard Lange says the industry needs to claw back its market share, to stop people turning to dairy substitutes.
"Milk is only 4 per cent fat, some consumers think that it's up to 17 per cent and that's a real myth that we need to bust in this campaign," he said.
