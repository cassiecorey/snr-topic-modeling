Bull sells for record price
The record price for an Australian stud bull has been doubled at a brahman bull sale near Rockhampton.
A 20-month-old bull sold for $300,000 at the McCamley families' Tartrus Lancefield sale.
It was bought by Graham Kemp from the Happy Valley Brahman stud at Mackay.
Spokesman Ken McCaffrey hopes other sons of the bull, JDH Baxter Manso, are as popular.
"They sold particularly well the sons of Baxter's through the sale but he was well credentialled in every way with pedigree and his group breed plan figures," Mr McCaffrey said.
