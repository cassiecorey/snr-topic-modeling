Farmers threaten legal action over SA pulp mill plans
Local farmers are threatening legal action to halt the development of a pulp mill near Penola in South Australia.
The $650 million mill won conditional approval yesterday, but still needs final Federal Government consent.
But the local landholder opposition group, the No Pulp Mill Alliance, says the development will lower water tables and increase air pollution.
Spokesman Duan Butler says the group is prepared for a fight.
"We've been saying all along that we would go as far as we had to go," he said.
