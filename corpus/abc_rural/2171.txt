Cane toads help reduce mosquito numbers
If you dread summer because of the mosquitoes, you might need to start hanging around cane toads.
As part of a study into the effect toads are having on native fauna, a team of scientists has found cane toad tadpoles are reducing mosquito numbers.
Professor of ecological biology at the University of Sydney Rick Shine says the toads could be contributing to better human health.
"We've simply set out bowls of water with and without cane toad tadpoles, we've put mosquito larvae in there and we've seen whether or not the mosquito larvae do survive and what size mozzie actually flies out at the end," Prof Shine said.
