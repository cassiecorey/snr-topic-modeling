Northern properties buy-up a 'long-term investment'
Two Queensland families are rumoured to have spent around $300 million on a major land and livestock purchase in Australia's north.
Graziers Peter Hughes and Bill Scott and their families have bought eight properties and 115,000 cattle from the Colonial Agricultural Fund.
While he will not say how much they paid, Mr Hughes says the 2 million hectare portfolio is a long-term investment.
"Whether it's good timing or not I am not sure but these opportunities don't arise very often, and when they arise you have got to grab them with both hands," he said.
"But we're in it for the long run. It's not a short-term thing for us.
