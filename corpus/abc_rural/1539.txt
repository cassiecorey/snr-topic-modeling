Timber industry opposes tax break changes
The timber industry wants the Federal Government to reject the latest push to scale back tax breaks for managed investment schemes.
Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton is believed to be pushing for a cap on tax deductions for investors in timber plantations.
Currently investors in the forestry sector receive a 100 per cent tax deduction, available during the first year they contribute.
Andrew White from Forest Enterprises Australia says the industry opposes any changes.
"If it falls within the general framework that we're aware of I don't think there will be any surprises," he said.
