Flinders Is may go native under tourism plan
One of South Australia's biggest islands could become an ecotourism venture.
Peter and Pam Woolford have begun discussions with the Department of Environment and Heritage about de-stocking Flinders Island, which is off Elliston on the state's west coast.
Mr Woolford says he wants to control the feral animals and reintroduce native plants and animals.
"What I'd like to see is the native flora and fauna returned more to its natural state," he said.
"We have some feral animals there, which are probably an inheritance off the Kupara, which ran aground on the island in 1946.
