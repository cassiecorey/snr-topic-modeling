Harvey Beef handover delayed
The handover of Western Australia's largest beef processor and exporter Harvey Beef has been delayed while the new owners try to strike a deal with workers.
The Stark-Harmony consortium was due to takeover today but has asked for a one-week delay to allow workers to vote on a new enterprise bargaining agreement.
Feedlotter Paul O'Meehan who helped broker the Stark Harmony deal, says he hopes they can sign off on the deal by next Monday.
"The new owners are better off getting these problems sorted and starting with a fresh slate rather than going into business and not being organised," he said.
