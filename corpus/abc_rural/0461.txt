India tenders for 3m tonnes of wheat imports
Wheat exporter AWB will face tough competition in the latest tender from India for 3 million tonnes of wheat, which was announced overnight.
The Indian market has emerged this year as a replacement for traditional markets in the Middle East, which are buying cheaper wheat from Europe and the Black Sea.
Grains analyst Malcolm Bartholomaeus says that has left Australia and the US struggling to find other customers for last year's bumper crop.
"India is very important both for Australia and for the global wheat market this year," he said.
"Egypt, of course, is a major importer of wheat. Right at the moment they tend to be favouring cheaper wheats out of Europe and Russia, so that both Australia and the US are missing out on that particular market.
"In terms of the Australian crop, and obviously losing a lot of market share in Iraq, India is equally important from that perspective as well."
While AWB has confirmed it will tender for the contract, details on price and volume remain confidential.
Meanwhile, it is unclear if some of AWB's legal costs for the Cole inquiry will come out of the returns for the national pool.
The legal bill is likely to have blown out from the $16 million AWB shareholders were told about at the annual general meeting in February.
The chairman of AWB International, Ian Donges, says AWB Limited is picking up all accounts at the moment.
But he says there is still discussion about whether some of those should be passed onto AWB International on behalf of the pool.
