'Functional foods' may help prevent disease
There is a growing trend in Europe to produce so-called 'functional foods'.
The foods are said to help prevent life threatening diseases or curb potential health problems like obesity, heart disease and high blood pressure.
Visiting food scientist Charles Daly, from University College Cork in Ireland, says there is also a trend to match individual human genetics to different food groups to improve health.
"We have different genetic make-up and so that means that we can have different susceptibility to some of the diseases that we mentioned, and that means that by looking at the genetic make-up of sub populations we can target foods to those groups," Mr Daly said.
