Drought, costs force farmers to cut water usage
The number of irrigated Australian farms has dropped a further 13 per cent, according to a new report by the bureau of statistics.
In the year 2004-05, just over 35,000 Australian farms used irrigation, down 5,000 on the year before.
The report shows less water is being used to grow pasture and rice, although more is going into growing cotton.
Doug Miell from the New South Wales Irrigators Council says the fall is partly due to drought, but also because of high water prices.
He says many irrigators are focusing on crops, which give them a higher return, or selling their water.
"There's obviously a consolidation happening right across agriculture in the irrigation sector, there's no difference in that regard," he said.
