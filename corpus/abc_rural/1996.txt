Scientist pessimistic about alternative fuel in Aust
Australia's chief scientist does not think alternative fuels have a big future in the country because of a shortage of available production land.
Dr Jim Peacock made the comments ahead of the Australian Farm Institute's strategic round table meeting on agriculture in Sydney today.
The conference is examining how science will assist agriculture over the next decade, especially in the areas of climate change, GM technology and strengthening international markets.
Dr Peacock says people must be realistic about the potential offered by the alternative energy source.
"There's a lot of talk about agriculture and biofuels, I personally don't think that's going to be of very much significance in Australia," he said.
"It's just a question of available land, production land.
"There's no doubt that ethanol is useful as a blend et cetera, but they'll be part of the portfolio.
