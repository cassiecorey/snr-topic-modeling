Beekeepers discuss industry's future
Australia's leading beekeepers are in Launceston today discussing the challenges of falling honey prices and the growing threat of disease.
It is estimated that the beekeeping industry is worth $1.7 billion to Australian agriculture, and at today's meeting, apiarists from around the country are deciding how best to allocate the annual half-a-million-dollar research and development budget to protect the future of the industry.
Chief among concerns is the threat of the verroa mite, which has already decimated the US industry and was found in New Zealand's South Island just three weeks ago.
