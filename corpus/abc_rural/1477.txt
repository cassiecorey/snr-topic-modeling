Middle East chefs go on Aussie culinary tour
Top chefs and food buyers from the Middle East will tour Australia this month, searching for the best local produce.
The ten-day visit will take in fresh markets and food producing companies in four states.
Marketing company Australian Quality Plus hopes to increase sales of meat and seafood to the region as well as introducing new products like dairy.
Managing director Steve Marafiote says Australian products have gained a reputation in the Middle East for their quality and sustainable supply.
"We've really tried to show the higher end, high-quality products that are available out of Australia - show those benefits that are available," he said.
