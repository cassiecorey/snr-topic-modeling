Meat processor offers cash incentives to find new workers
South Australian-based meat processor T&R Pastoral is offering cash incentives to try to attract new abattoir workers.
The company is looking for 80 employees interstate to work in plants at Murray Bridge and Lobethal.
Spokesman Brian Deavey says both meatworks are operating at full capacity as farmers destock and the additional labour is urgently needed.
"We actually are assisting with relocation costs and housing for people right around Australia to come to Murray Bridge and to Lobethal, our two South Australian plants to work," he said.
