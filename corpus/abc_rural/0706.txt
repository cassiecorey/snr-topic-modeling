Fuel prices more urgent than nuclear power, say farmers
The National Farmers Federation says the Federal Government needs to urgently tackle high fuel prices, ahead of developing nuclear power.
It is supporting another government inquiry into alternative fuels, which will look at whether a commercial biofuel industry is viable.
NFF president Peter Corish says many farm petrol and diesel bills have risen 70 per cent since 2004, and urgent action is needed to promote alternative fuels.
"There are real opportunities for a number of our agricultural industries and certainly our view is that both need to be focussed on but probably the opportunities that exist from biofuels are more immediate than will come from the nuclear debate," he said.
Meanwhile, ethanol production has been flagged as a potential new industry for Australia's biggest irrigation scheme.
Consultants from Perth and Brazil are looking at the viability of growing sugar cane in the second stage of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme, in Western Australia's far north.
