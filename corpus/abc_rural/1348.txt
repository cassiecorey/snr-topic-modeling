Ethanol plant construction under way
Work on Australia's first purpose-built ethanol plant is starting in north-west Victoria today.
Australian Ethanol plans to produce 100 million litres of ethanol annually at the Swan Hill plant, which is due to be completed late next year.
Chief executive Peter Anderton says local farmers will supply it with 350,000 tonnes of grain and corn.
"Corn would provide about a third of the grain required and then the remainder we would source off winter crops, wheat and barley," he said.
