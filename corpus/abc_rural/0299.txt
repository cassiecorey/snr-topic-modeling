Cyclone causes minor damage
There has been big rainfall in the wake of cyclone Monica in far north Queensland.
The category three cyclone cross the north-east coast late yesterday but does not appear to have caused too much damage.
Cyclone Monica followed almost exactly the same path as cyclone Ingrid which ripped through the region about 13 months ago.
Monica hit land just south of the Lockhart Aboriginal community.
Very few commercial fishing boats were sheltering in Lockhart River's mangroves and so far there has been no reports of major incidents.
On cattle properties in the cyclone's path the strong winds brought down some branches, trees, sheds and fences but overall damage has been minor.
Tom Burns manages Orchid Creek station and he says his biggest problem was finding his dogs.
