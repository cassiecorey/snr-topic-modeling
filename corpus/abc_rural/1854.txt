Coalition split over AWB's single desk
The Deputy Prime Minister, Mark Vaile, says a split between Coalition MPs, on whether the single desk wheat export system should be scrapped, is just a symptom of a healthy debate.
In the wake of Cole inquiry evidence about AWB kickbacks to Iraq, up to six MPs including Wilson Tuckey, have called for the end of the single desk.
But Nationals members, including Senator Barnaby Joyce, say it must be maintained.
Mr Vaile says the Government is considering all the views of MPs and Senators, along with wheat grower groups.
"We really do need to wait until Cole reports, which is about a month away, and have a look at what the recommendations are and what the outcome of the inquiry is and how that affects the whole structure," he said.
"We don't want to be making decisions that may be seen as knee-jerk reactions and then have to go through another set of changes if there are particular recommendations coming out of Cole."
Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan says that, while he supports a single desk, it is debatable whether AWB is the best company to run it.
