Processing delays force saleyard's NLIS overhaul
Processing delays of up to 24 hours have forced Australia's biggest saleyards to overhaul its National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) infrastructure.
With 11,000 cattle on offer today, new in-pen scanning is being put to the test at the Roma Saleyards in Queensland.
A year after NLIS became mandatory in the state, the saleyards' board is scrapping two run-through scanners worth $270,000.
While they read tags with 99 per cent efficiency, large volumes of cattle mean even minor misreads could cause huge disruptions.
Brisbane-based company Livestock Link has been contracted to pick up any missing tags and non-reader tags more efficiently, by pre-scanning cattle before sales in pens.
