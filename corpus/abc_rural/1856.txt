Abalone farm 
A Port Fairy abalone farm has been working hard to get its business back on track after being affected by the abalone virus that affected the south-west earlier this year. Southern Ocean Mariculture voluntarily destocked to prevent the disease spreading further and now has no commercial stock on the farm. The company has been running a sentinel trial for the last six weeks to see if there are still any diseases outside the water of the farm and the results have come back negative. Sarah Farnsworth caught up with general manager Mark Jervis to find out what process is now taking place so the farm can be restocked.
