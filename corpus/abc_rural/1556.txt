Hi-tech quarantine lab set up in Darwin
Suspect plant diseases and insects gathered across northern Australia and Asia will now be checked in new secure hi-tech laboratories in Darwin.
More than $3 million has been spent creating the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's new headquarters.
Plant pathologist Jane Ray says the upgrade includes filter systems to ensure that no material escapes or hitchhikes on staff.
"This facility is specifically designed to handle pathogens of quarantine concern like citrus canker for example," she said.
"Citrus canker could be worked on in the bio-hazard cabinet, which would enable the pathogen to be contained within the cabinet.
"The negative pressure and the procedures and protocols in place would prevent the escape of this pathogen.
"We could actually diagnose it here, rapidly and move for eradication, rather than actually delaying diagnosis as well."
Another hi-tech quarantine lab is due to be constructed in Cairns, North Queensland.
