GE rice contaminates US crop
The US agriculture secretary says US supplies of long-grain rice are contaminated with a genetically-engineered variety which has not been approved for human use.
Mike Johanns has announced that Bayer CropScience of Germany has told the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Food and Drug Administration that the experimental rice poses no threat to humans or the environment.
But Mr Johanns does not know where the contaminated rice was found, how widespread it is, or how it entered the food supply.
As for US customers, Mr Johanns says he is "are providing information to my colleagues".
"I'm talking to them. I have indicated to them that we will provide whatever information they need," he said.
Testing kits will be supplied if required and USDA will investigate.
