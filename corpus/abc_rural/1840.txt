Frost hits cherry growers hardest
Severe frost has destroyed up to half of this season's fruit crop in Tasmania.
It has been confirmed that cherry growers have been hardest hit, with losses ranging from 30 to 80 per cent, while apple and apricot growers have also reported heavy losses.
Domestic shortages are now expected in the coming months after frost also decimated Victoria's Goulburn Valley crop.
And Gerald Ellis, from the Vineyards Association of Tasmania, says some grape growers expect to lose half this season's fruit.
