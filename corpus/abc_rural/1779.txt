Urgent talks needed to reassure North Asian trade partners: Opposition
The Federal Opposition says the diplomatic row over North Korea's claimed nuclear weapon test will have to be carefully defused to prevent Australia's trade into North Asia being disrupted.
The Government says it is looking to the UN Security Council to take action against North Korea.
The Opposition's trade spokesman, Kevin Rudd, says China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea buy $70 billion of commodities and products from Australia, and urgent talks are needed to reassure them.
