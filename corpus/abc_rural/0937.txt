VFF pushes for single wheat desk changes
The Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) has joined growing calls for changes to the single desk for wheat exports, in the wake of the oil-for-food Inquiry.
Under its plan, wheat exporter AWB Limited and AWB International would be split, with international wheat sales returned to farmer control.
The VFF will seek endorsement for the proposal from the Grains Council of Australia later this month.
VFF grains group president Ian Hastings says the plan addresses concerns about governance of the system, and payments to growers from the national wheat pool.
"We're talking about separation of AWB International and making sure that AWB International continues to have the legislative monopoly for exports of wheat," Mr Hastings said.
