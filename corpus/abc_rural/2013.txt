Pumping water
Calls to pump water from northern Australia to the south has received support from a US scientist, who says similar projects have solved water shortages there.
Professor Scott Bassett from the Desert Research Institute in Nevada says water in rivers and underground basins is worth big money.
He says in the US water is being piped from farming areas to cities because population growth is outstripping water supplies.
"Water moves uphill and it moves uphill to money. Big cities will pay for their water supply in such a way as $3 billion canals from Phoenix to the Colorado River so they'll ship the water from the Colorado River to cities like Phoenix which has the base to supply the economic drive to get the water up there," he said.
But former Californian farmer Spike Dessert, who now lives in the Kimberley, says the distance water is piped in the US does not compare with Australia.
He says some pumping schemes are just 300 kilometres long, nothing compared to the thousands of kilometres of pipeline that would be needed here.
