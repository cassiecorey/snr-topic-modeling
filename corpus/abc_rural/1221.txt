Tomato growers set to profit under new quarantine deal
Australian tomato growers exporting to New Zealand expect cost cuts and increased profits under a new quarantine deal.
The existing inspection regime has been relaxed under an agreement between Biosecurity Australia, the Quarantine Inspection Service and New Zealand authorities.
Exports across the Tasman are worth more than $5 million each year.
Andrew Phillip from Bundaberg-based SP Exports says the new quarantine regulations take effect immediately.
