Survey suggests city dwellers in the dark about farms
A new Landcare survey shows more than 60 per cent of people living in the capital cities have little or no understanding of Australian farms.
It also shows that only one in three people have ever visited a farm.
Landcare commissioned the research to gauge what people know of efforts by farmers to improve the environment.
And chief executive Brian Scars Brick says the rural sector needs to do more to educate those living in urban areas.
"The worrying trend of course is that for younger people, the figure went right up to 70 per cent of people not knowing what was going on behind the farm gate," he said.
