Radical changes to wheat export system may cost millions
The Grains Council says making radical changes to the wheat export system before this season's harvest could cost the industry half a billion dollars.
Ahead of releasing a blueprint on the future of the single desk next week, the Grains Council says it will be calling for AWB to retain control of selling this season's harvest.
The council's David Ginns says despite the obvious concerns over AWB, it is still the best company to manage Australia's wheat exports in the near term.
"It's not just something you can say 'ok let's make a change tomorrow'," he said.
The council says AWB and other traders have invested millions of dollars based on AWB's control of the pool and any sudden change will hurt growers.
Mr Ginns has also angrily rejected a report suggesting growers want this year's harvest underwritten to the tune of a billion dollars by the Federal Government.
