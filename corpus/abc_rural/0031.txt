Govt urged to get tougher on enforcing food labelling laws
Fruit and vegetable growers are calling on the Federal Government to get tougher on states which do not enforce country-of-origin labelling laws.
Producer group AUSVEG says some states are not pushing for new laws to be implemented on fresh and packaged produce, and that is misleading consumers.
Chief executive John Roach says the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) needs to look at the issue again.
"Excuse the pun out of the vegetable industry but you do need a reasonable amount of carrot and you do need a little bit of stick," he said.
"And what has not happened with any consistency across Australia is that last one, that bit of stick, it is not consistent - it varies hugely and often there are cases where it doesn't exist at all."
The ACCC says the labelling issue has been looked at and the authority is satisfied with current compliance.
