Govts told to prepare for loss of industry
Local councils and state governments are being told they should be planning for a potential loss of industry decades before it might occur, if they are to give rural towns a future.
Demographer and social researcher Bernard Salt believes communities need to plan for the worst, and guarantee themselves a range of employment and investment.
He says they should be looking 20 years down the track.
