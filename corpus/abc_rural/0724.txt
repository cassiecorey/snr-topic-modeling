Scientists to test new bait chemical
Experts say a new chemical to be tested next week has the potential to change the way some of Australia's pest animals are controlled.
The Invasive Animal Cooperative Research Centre says the poison, PAP, was originally designed by the US military, and can be used on wild dogs, feral pigs and foxes.
Research scientist Dr Ricky Spencer says the trials will test the antidote component of the chemical, which is something the current poison known as 1080, does not have.
