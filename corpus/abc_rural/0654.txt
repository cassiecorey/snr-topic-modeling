Simplot increases prices for pea growers
Vegetable processor Simplot says it is responding to the concerns raised through the Fair Dinkum Food Campaign by offering Tasmanian farmers better prices and contracts for their peas.
Simplot wants to almost double the amount of peas it buys to meet new demand from the major supermarket chains for Australian-grown product.
Managing director Terry O'Brien is also hoping a 6 per cent price rise will encourage growers back into the industry.
"I'm encouraging them to think about the fact that they stimulated a lot of interest last year with their tractor trip to Canberra," he said.
