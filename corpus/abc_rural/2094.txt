Involve agriculture in carbon trading talks, adviser says
An adviser in carbon trading says the agriculture sector needs to be involved in talks about setting up an Australian trading system.
Carbon trading encourages companies to offset the release of greenhouse gases, by planting trees or paying someone else to plant them.
Prime Minister John Howard wants to set up a taskforce to develop a carbon trading plan.
Tony Beck from the Australasian Emissions Trading Forum says agriculture's role as a carbon sink needs to be taken into account.
"We don't know a lot about what's going to be involved," he said.
