AWB payments to Saddam regime not bribes: ATO
There has been a strong surge in AWB's share price today after the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) cleared the company of any wrongdoing in an investigation of payments made under the oil-for-food program.
Findings from the Cole inquiry said AWB wrote off payments under the oil-for-food program as tax deductions, including those to trucking company Alia.
It had been thought the company may have been liable for up to $450 million in penalties and unpaid tax.
But in a statement to the stock exchange, AWB says the tax office has found the payments did not constitute bribes to foreign public officials under the Income Tax Assessment Act.
The stock market has reacted favourably, with AWB shares gaining more than 7 per cent this morning, trading at $2.81 shortly before 10:00am AEDT.
Meanwhile AWB's rivals are being asked for details on their prices, returns to growers and the effect their applications might have on the national pool.
The conditions are set out in a letter from the Department of Agriculture sent this week to all the companies that want to export wheat.
The letter says the Government wants more information as it tries to establish the 'public interest' value of each application.
Exporter Peter Howard from Ozepulse says some of conditions are surprising.
"I think it's unusual - we've always thought and argued in the past that any applications approved wouldn't really have any effect to the detriment of the pool," he said.
"But I guess it's a point in question looking at what the cost might be to those pool participants, would they increase if these applications are granted.
"Perhaps they would, but our answer is that surely AWB should be reducing those fees to those pool participants."
