South Korea rejects US beef shipment
South Korea has rejected a US beef shipment over a tiny bone fragment, dealing a major blow to US efforts to recapture the market.
US beef was first banned in Korea after mad cow disease was detected in Washington state in 2003.
US Agriculture Department Deputy Under-Secretary Chuck Lambert is upset, not just that Korea will not accept any bone in US beef, which could transmit mad cow disease, but by the way it handled the initial post-mad cow US shipment.
"It's disappointing that they've gone to the lengths that they have to identify this small, very small piece of bone in more than nine tonnes of product," he said.
The US has asked an international standard setting body to assign the US a mad cow-risk classification but insists US beef meets existing safety guidelines.
