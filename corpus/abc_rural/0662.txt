Code of practice limits use of sow stalls
The pork industry has agreed to limit the use of sow stalls under a new code of practice for the welfare of pigs.
Australian Pork Limited, the peak body representing producers, says it will reduce the amount of time pigs spend in the stalls, from the full 16 weeks of pregnancy to six weeks.
Peter Robertson from the New South Wales Farmers Association says it is a proactive step to improve animal care.
"The industry has taken the decision that we have to concede that we need to have sows with a little more exercise during gestation," he said.
"By the same token we need the sow stalls for the first six weeks that they are pregnant so that they do not abort and have other problems at that stage."
