Tomato producer calls for eradication of new plant virus
Australia's chief plant health officers will try to control rather than eradicate a new tomato virus in Queensland.
Yellow leaf curl virus has been confirmed for the first time in Australia at farms on the outskirts of Brisbane.
It is carried by silver leaf whitefly and quarantine measures are expected to be announced this week.
James Head from Queensland's largest tomato producer, SP Exports, says an eradication program would have been better.
"I'd say control is probably the easier option to take," he said.
"Whether or not the effects will be what's desired for the outcome, whether control would be better than eradication, I'd say eradication would sound the better idea.
