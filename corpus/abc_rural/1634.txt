Prices soar at organic wool sale
Prices have soared at Australia's first organic wool sale in Melbourne, with some fleeces fetching up to 50 cents a kilogram more than non-organic.
Three-hundred bales of wool from South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have been auctioned.
Elders spokesman Michael Blake says the difference in price was stark and more organic auctions are likely to be held down the track.
"We had two of the largest buyers in Australia bidding against each other to take these levels above the normal market for the type on the day," he said.
"The finer end of the wool went to 50 cents and higher above its equivalent.
"The middle microns, say 21, 21-and-a-half, it was a good 30 to 50 cents above the equivalent fleece types.
