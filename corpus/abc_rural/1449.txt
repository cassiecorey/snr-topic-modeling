SA bushfire season may start early
South Australia's bushfire season could be brought forward because of the threat posed by the predicted hot dry summer.
Deputy chief officer Andrew Lawson, from the Country Fire Service, says the lack of winter rain has also raised the fire threat.
The state's bushfire season usually starts on the Eyre Peninsula on November 1.
But Mr Lawson says but it could begin weeks earlier.
"We're very concerned about the lack of rain over winter and that will lead to the forest fuels being drier a lot earlier," he said.
