Drought and salt tolerant crops to be available sooner
Farmers are set to receive new crop varieties faster with two new plant research centres being set up in Adelaide and Canberra.
The National Plant Phenomics Facility will adapt the latest medical imaging technology to use on plants at the CSIRO in Canberra.
In Adelaide, plants will be moved around on conveyor belts and photographed in 3D as they grow.
CSIRO Plant Industries chief Dr Jeremy Burdon says crops that are more drought and salt tolerant will be available sooner.
"We believe that this will lead to a major increase in the effort that we can apply and through that the speed which we can deliver to farmers important and new invaluable traits," he said.
"And those sorts of traits are obviously those that are at the forefront of all our minds at present and believe will continue to be.
