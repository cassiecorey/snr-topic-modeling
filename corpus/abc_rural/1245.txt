Murray River system needs 'a lot of rain'
Water inflows to the Murray River system over the past five years have been the lowest on record and this year is shaping up to be another tough one.
With inflows since 2001 at just 40 per cent of the long-term average, Trevor Jacobs from River Murray Water says a lot of rain is needed.
"The catchments aren't responding well yet to rainfall," he said.
