German company buys wool directly through producers
One of the world's major wool spinners has started buying greasy wool directly from merino producers because of high levels of dark fibre contamination in wool being sold through Australian auction rooms.
German company Sudwolle processes 200,000 bales a year at mills in China, Germany and Poland - the equivalent of 10 per cent of the Australian wool clip.
It has been trialing buying wool through an Adelaide firm, which sources bales from a small group of fine wool growers.
Director of purchasing Gotz Giebel blames the high contamination rate on a trend by growers towards sheep which produce both meat and wool, which have more black fibres in their fleece.
"We have initiated that because we noticed a lot of quality problems and due to our size and our market situation we thought we have to do something in the industry," he said.
"Also to encourage growers and that's very important.
"We also want to reward the grower for better qualities."
But wool brokers and buyers in South Australia believe local producers have grown one of the best clips of the past five seasons.
Landmark's state wool manager Trevor James says the quality has held up despite the lack of rain.
"Probably that early rain in March put a bit of feed on the ground and that early rain made a big difference, so we've got a lot of really good length, good sound wools, probably been the best we've seen for five years and we've had some really fantastic wools coming through," he said.
