$50m for aquaculture, seafood firm
A Western Australian businessman has launched a $50 million buy-up of aquaculture farms in South Australia.
Analysts say the creation of a major seafood company could lead to better prices and major export deals for oyster growers.
The company known as Aqafood has entered contracts to buy several oyster farms on the Eyre Peninsula and an atlantic salmon and ocean trout farming operation in the south-east.
Adelaide business broker Martin White says the venture could see more seafood being sold in untapped export markets.
"It's a progression the industry needs to take, in as much as there isn't a corporatisation at all in a lot of the smaller aquaculture industries and I think to develop and grow the industries this is a positive approach," he said.
