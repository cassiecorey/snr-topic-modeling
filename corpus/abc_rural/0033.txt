Code of conduct for rodeo organisers
Rodeo organisers in Tasmania will have to comply with a mandatory code of conduct in the future.
The code is being implemented after a public outcry over rodeo practices.
There have been two very public incidents at rodeos in the past fortnight that have outraged animal rights activists and the television watching public.
A bull was put down after dragging its paralysed hindquarters behind it as it left the ring and on Saturday a bucking horse was put down in the arena after it broke a leg as it exited the chute.
The public outcry has forced the State Government to declare a mandatory set of regulations will soon be enforced on all rodeos before a permit is issued.
A major requirement will be for a vet to be on site at all events, rather than only on call.
