Debt an obstacle to wool merger
The wool industry remains committed to a merger between its promotion and research arms, despite a dispute over a $27 million debt.
Australian Wool Services, which owns the Woolmark brand, is seeking financial help from the Federal Government to pay the debt, without success.
The owed money relates to a pension fund for former UK-based employees.
Chairman of Australian Wool Innovation Ian McLachlan says he understands the Government's position, but there will not be a merger between the two companies until the bill is paid.
"I've been in government and I think when a government has a position, it has to repeat that position, and it will hold that position until somebody comes up with a really bright idea as to how we can solve it," he said.
