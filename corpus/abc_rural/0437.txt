Farmers wary of govt changes to fuel rebates
Farmers already fighting higher interest rates and the strong Aussie dollar now face changes to their fuel bills from July 1, which could add further pressure to their budgets.
The Federal Government will scrap a tax subsidy rebate worth up to three cents a litre to regional motorists, and change the 18-cent a litre on-road energy credit scheme.
Under the scheme, farmers and transport operators will receive their fuel rebate off their GST bills, instead of a cash grant paid directly into their bank accounts.
Luke Fraser from the Livestock Transporters Association says the changes will create a cash flow headache for rural and regional businesses.
"We have a business where over 30 per cent of our total cost input is fuel. Farmers would probably understand that sentiment," he said.
"And in that sort of position, when you're being asked to go through administrative hoops to try and claim that back, and you never actually see it in cash, it's just coming off a tax bill, well that's a big change.
"To say, look on July 1 it's all going to switch over and everyone will be fine, is incredibly naive and insulting."
A spokesman for Assistant Treasurer Peter Dutton says it will be simpler in the long run to deliver the energy credit to farmers and truckers through their GST bills.
