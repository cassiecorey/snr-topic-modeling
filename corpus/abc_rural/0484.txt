Grape growers mull mothballing vines
Grape growers in South Australia's Riverland are considering mothballing their vines, hoping to ride out the industry's oversupply.
Many local growers could not sell their fruit this year, with wineries suspending or not renewing contracts.
With no relief in sight, growers say they could prune heavily or use chemicals to hinder fruit growth to hibernate vines instead of having to pull them out.
Berri grape grower Bill Ruediger says he will have to make a decision very soon.
