Govt blasted for not helping frost-devastated growers
The Victorian Government is under fire for not providing financial help to regions hit by devastating frosts earlier this year.
The Government yesterday announced measures to help fruit growers in the Goulburn Valley, who lost at least half their stonefruit crops to frost earlier this week.
Back in June, the Murray Valley lost $17 million worth of citrus to frost.
But John Tesoriero, from the Murray Valley Citrus Board, says calls for help from growers in his region have gone unheeded.
"This particular area though the Sunraysia Citrus Growers did write to Minister Cameron requesting that he come inspect the damage for himself," he said.
