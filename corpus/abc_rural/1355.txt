Pilbara reflects on 40 years of exports
It is 40 years ago today since the first shipment of iron ore from Western Australia's Pilbara region.
In 1966, the 52,00 tonne shipment left the port of Dampier, on WA's north-west coast, bound for Japan.
David Smith, from Pilbara Iron, says Japan remains a major customer but there have been big changes in the past four decades.
"It started off with about a hundred or so people in its first operation," he said.
"There's about 5,000 employees that work in Pilbara Iron now, plus of course a lot of contractors who are important service providers that work and help support the company as well.
