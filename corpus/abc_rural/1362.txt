Wheat virus found in commercial WA crop
Wheat streak mosaic virus has been found in a commercial crop in Western Australia for the first time.
Wheat seed was banned from entering WA last year to prevent the virus spreading into the state, but it was found in April this year.
Roger Jones, from the Department of Agriculture, believes the virus probably found its way west before the ban was imposed.
He says it has now been found on a farm at Merredin in the Wheatbelt.
"The danger from the disease is when you get early-sown crops, sown at a time of year when it's still warm," he said.
"The mites can actually build up to very large numbers.
