Bird flu confirmed in UK
The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been confirmed in the UK for the first time.
Tests on a wild swan in Scotland have confirmed the disease.
The Scottish Government has set up a surveillance zone and banned the movement of birds in or out of the area.
Germany has also reported its first case of bird flu in commerical poultry, and in Africa, H5N1 has reached the continent's largest city of Lagos, in Nigeria.
Meanwhile, the latest quarantine surveys in East Timor show there is still no sign of avian influenza.
Four major initiatives are underway to increase the chances of early detection, and to help the East Timorese prepare for the disease.
Dr Emma Watkins says improved public awareness, rapid disease testing and helping plan scarce resources are key points.
"Effective surveillance really relies on being able to investigate disease as it comes along," she said.
So the capacity of the local animal health authorities to do that, is really important. So we have undertaken a continuous effort to increase the capacity to locally diagnose this disease.
