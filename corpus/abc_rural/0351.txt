Investment schemes urged to stop new vineyard developments
Wine grape growers are urging investment schemes to put the brakes on new vineyard developments.
Peak body Wine Grape Growers Australia says money is still being put into the sector despite a massive oversupply of grapes.
Executive director Mark McKenzie says people should be wary about investing without a long term, secure contract for the fruit.
"It's not just independent grape growers or contracted, or uncontracted, grape growers who supply to wineries would be concerned," he said.
