Sheep and cattle prices slump
Prices for sheep and cattle have crashed in South Australia after massive stock sell-offs last week.
Across many regions a lack of rain has seen pastures dry up forcing producers to sell off livestock early in the season.
More than 100,000 sheep, lambs and cattle went through the saleyards last week, forcing prices down.
Bruce Redpath from Southern Australian Livestock in Naracoorte has not seen prices so low in years.
"The biggest drop has been on cows I think, where we've seen cows fall in a week, a hundred to a $150," he said.
