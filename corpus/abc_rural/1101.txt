Sprouts can curb cancer: DPI
New research has shown eating the sprouts that are often found in mixed salads can help curb cancer.
The Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has investigated 22 different brassicas, including broccoli and cauliflower.
It has found sprouts can contain up to 200 times more of a chemical which helps dissolve carcinogens, than mature vegetables do.
DPI physiologist Tim O'Hare says radish and broccoli sprouts rated the highest.
