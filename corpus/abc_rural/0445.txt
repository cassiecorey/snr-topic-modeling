NFF calls for schools to examine interest groups
The National Farmers Federation is calling on governments to ban special interest groups from unvetted entry to school classrooms.
Animal rights group Voiceless has launched a web-based education program which offers prizes for the most humane school and encourages children to speak out about factory farming, kangaroo culling and live exports.
NFF president Peter Corrish says the website has links to extreme animal rights groups.
"What we're saying is the principals of each school and certainly the parents of the children involved need to have a look at this website and actually go to these links and see what information their children may be accessing," he said.
