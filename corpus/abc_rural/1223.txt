Leeuwin II changes young lives in NT
Forty young people from across the Northern Territory now have a career on the high seas in mind after a week at sea.
The group has been aboard Australia's biggest sail training ship, the Leeuwin II.
For 14-year-old Riley Vaughan of Wave Hill Station south-west of Katherine, it was the chance of a life-time.
"How hard it was to work a little sailing ship, I thought I had it tied down, it'd be pretty easy but it wasn't good enough," Riley said.
"I reckon the coils, the knots were the hardest, unfurling the sails, you have to climb up and and crawl out on the end of the sail and unroll it, but it was worth it.
"Everyone once in their life should have a ride on the Leeuwin."
