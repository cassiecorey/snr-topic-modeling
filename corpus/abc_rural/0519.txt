AWB searches for new market for stranded wheat
Wheat exporter AWB says it is trying to find another market for a shipment of wheat stranded at Geraldton in Western Australia, due to a quarantine dispute with India.
The ship has been docked for a month, while talks have been under way to resolve the problem.
The ship is expected to be loaded today.
Paul Ryan, AWB's industry relations manager in WA, says two other vessels have been unloaded successfully in India, but he cannot say why this vessel has been in port for so long.
"It is more to do with a range of quarantine restrictions, in terms of bringing wheat into India," he said.
