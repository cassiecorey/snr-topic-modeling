ABS revises grain storage figures
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has been forced to re-release figures on the amount of grain in storage after the industry questioned the statistics.
Earlier this week, the ABS said bulk grain handling companies had more than 13 million tonnes of grain in stock, including 10 million tonnes of wheat.
The revised figures show a drop to 10 million tonnes in storage overall, with wheat making up around 7 million.
The bureau's Karen Connaughton says there were a number of reasons for the change.
"We haven't undertaken this collection since December 2004 so it was quite difficult for us to verify the benchmark figure," she said.
"We did make some efforts to verify the figure and we got some broad parameters from people, and it appears that the estimates we provided were too high."
