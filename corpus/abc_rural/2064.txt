Rio Tinto hails emission-cutting pig iron process
Mining giant Rio Tinto has developed a revolutionary method of producing pig iron for steel making that could slash greenhouse gas emissions.
Known as HIsmelt, the new technology has taken 25 years and $1 billion to develop, and could replace high energy use blast furnaces around the world.
Managing director of the HIsmelt Corporation, Stephan Webber, says the process still requires iron ore and coal, but removes the need for massive coke ovens.
