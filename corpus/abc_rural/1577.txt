Talks aimed at resolving horticultural industry code of conduct dispute
Talks are under way in Canberra between growers and wholesalers aimed at resolving the bitter dispute over a code of conduct for the horticultural industry.
Prime Minister John Howard has agreed to a mandatory system, if a voluntary proposal put up by the Government at today's meeting is rejected.
The key sticking points involve a clear definition of who is an agent and who is a wholesaler, enforceable transparent contracts and a dispute resolution process.
