Saltbush shrubland plan angers graziers
Graziers in western New South Wales are furious about a proposal to list old man saltbush shrubland as endangered.
The New South Wales Scientific Committee has found saltbush shrubland has fallen by 70 per cent since European settlement and the rest is at risk of extinction from clearing and grazing.
But Graham Morphett, who has a property north-west of Hay, says the plant is thriving in the western division due to good management and rabbit control.
"I've got 170,000 acres out here and I have tens of thousands of acres of old man saltbush with up to 5,000 acre stands," he said.
