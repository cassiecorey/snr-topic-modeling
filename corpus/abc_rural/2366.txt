Qld storms crush fruit and cane crops
Severe storms which lashed south-east Queensland over the weekend have flattened young sugar cane crops and destroyed fruit in the Childers district, near Bundaberg.
Strong winds have brought down trees and power lines, while hail stones described as half the size of cricket balls have damaged crops.
Cane, mango and lychee grower John Muller was set to harvest fruit in coming weeks, but says his crops have been almost completely wiped out.
"There's probably less than 1 per cent of the mangoes hanging on the tree and every one of them has five or six chops out of them," he said.
