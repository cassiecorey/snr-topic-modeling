Rural workers at risk of cancer, report shows
A new report has found workers in rural industries like agriculture, forestry and mining are most at risk of developing cancer.
The study by the Queensland Cancer Fund and the University of Sydney has found twice as many people as previously thought are exposed to cancer-causing substances at work, including pesticides, UV rays and dust.
Gordon Gregory from the National Rural Health Alliance, says country workers face a double whammy, because a lack of medical care in the bush can severely reduce the chance of survival.
"Agriculture forestry and fishing are dangerous occupations - but normally we tend to think in terms of accidents," he said.
"Now we have got this report which frankly surprises me that it is also the cause of high rates of cancers.
