Pastoralists expect to double cattle production
Northern Territory pastoralists expect to increase cattle production by 50 per cent within the next 10 years, according to the first comprehensive survey since the early 1980s.
Better fencing and water points in central Australia, and improved pasture in the north would result in the increased carrying capacity
Pastoral extension officer Trudi Oxley says improved weaning rates also mean more production.
"We came up with a weaning percentage across the NT as being 71 per cent, so for every hundred cows there were 71 weaners pulled off them when they were mustered and a mortality rate around 3 per cent," she said.
