Failure to reach trade deal could delay Doha talks: Vaile
Despite missing a crucial deadline in global negotiations to reduce trade distorting tariffs and subsidies in agriculture, Trade Minister Mark Vaile says a deal can be reached this year.
Mr Vaile flew back into Australia this morning after talks in Europe and says the European Union is now looking at further reductions in the financial support it gives to farmers.
But he is warning a failure to get a deal this year, could delay the Doha Round of talks until 2011.
"That is the great unknown because once we go beyond the northern summer which is fundamentally August, the farm Bill has to be renewed and there's already pressure coming on in Congress in Washington to start writing a new farm Bill," he said.
