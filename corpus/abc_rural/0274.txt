Global oil prices continue rising
Global oil prices continue to climb to record heights as Australia's grain growers prepare for this year's planting season.
Last night New York benchmark crude oil closed at more than $US70 a barrel for the first time in 23 years of trading.
Commodity analyst Tobin Gorey says running costs and fertiliser prices will rise further but there could be more demand for wheat and canola to make replacement biofuels.
"The costs are actually higher so people need to be compensating farmers and so on for producing it so it is profitable otherwise they won't stay in the business," he said.
"But the other side of that too is that demand for things like ethanol or biodiesel that creates further demand for oilseeds and grains as well.
"Perhaps that can also help boost the prices and is perhaps already influencing markets now to a small degree."
The combination of rising fuel and fertiliser costs is cause for concern for many farmers.
Graingrowers in South Australia's Mallee told Kerrie Lush cutting back on cropping is not an option and they are looking at other ways to reduce costs.
"We're certainly not cutting back on any acreage we're sowing but David's certainly going to try and do as much direct seeding without working up anything to save a bit of fuel that way," Val Gibbs from Wunkar said.
She says fertiliser prices are also far more expensive than last year.
"We have trialled putting zinc on through seed dressing instead of through fertiliser so that saves a bit of money that way."
