Water sensors may cut irrigation losses significantly
An irrigation expert says multi-million dollar projects using water sensors could cut irrigation losses by between 10 and 20 per cent across Australia.
That is equivalent to all the water used in urban areas.
John Langford, director of the Water Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, says the first year of trials has been completed and indications are that it could halve the cost of irrigation efficiency programs.
"It involves a unit called a nictor, which would be about the size of a coffee pot, you can dot them around at random in the landscape, so long as they are close enough to each other they will form their own wireless network," he said.
