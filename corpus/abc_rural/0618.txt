More extreme weather predicted for Victoria
Victoria's Department of Primary Industries is predicting the state will experience more extreme weather, with increasing temperatures and less rainfall.
It is carrying out a research project called the Climate Change Challenge to try to help farmers adapt.
Project leader David Halliwell says most farmers in drier areas like the Wimmera and Mallee are used to a variable climate, but they might not be ready to cope with what climate models are predicting.
"Our frequency of extreme weather events are likely to increase into the future," he said.
"It is also saying that on average temperatures will increase but this doesn't just mean the maximum temperatures will increase, but the minimum temperatures will increase a little bit as well.
