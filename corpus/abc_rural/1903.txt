Gold mine operator agrees to provide water to farmers
Farmers have had a breakthrough in their dispute with the new Lake Cowal gold mine in the central west of New South Wales, which has had a dramatic impact on local bore water levels.
The water level has dropped from 20 metres to 50 metres below ground level.
Lachlan Valley Water's Mary Ewing says the company has now agreed to provide stock and domestic water to farmers, if the water table continues to drop.
"One of the requirements is that if those trigger levels are approached, you have to continue to supply the impacted stock and domestics," she said.
"So while there is water there I guess stock and domestic will be maintained.
