SA wool growers oppose AWI levy increase
Wool growers in southern South Australia say they will not support a push to increase the levy they pay to the peak body, Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
A report released this week says AWI has returned $417 million in benefits to the wool industry.
But growers say they will not vote to increase the levy above the current rate of 2 per cent in this year's wool poll.
Tony Hedges, from Keith, does not think growers should pay anything.
"What have they done for us?" he said.
"What they're doing now is the repeat of what they did 20 years ago, and what happened 20 years ago was the repeat of what they did 20 years before.
"I don't think they need any more money, I think they squander what money they've got there now.
"They've had their chances and they've blown it, I think."
Trevor Little, from Kongorong, says growers have seen little output from the AWI.
"The money that's been achieved over the years, and many years of the levy on the wool has not really in the last 10 years achieved anything," he said.
Malcolm McDonald, from Willalooka Pastoral Company, added: "I don't think, from a promotional point of view, that it's been spent wisely.
