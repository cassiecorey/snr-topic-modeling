Package welcomed
The exceptional circumstances (EC) extension is very welcome in the grazing country from Canberra south to the Victorian border.
From Braidwood to the Snowy Mountains, graziers have been destocking and trying to survive for several years on less than half average rainfall.
Brian Clifford, from the Cooma Rural Lands Protection Board, says governments cannot do any more now for farmers, unless they can make it rain.
"At least they're recognising that they need the rural industry and it is a one in one hundred or probably worse now," he said.
"I think it's great news what they have done and let's hope we get a break in the autumn."
But the first stage of the drought assistance package will offer relief to only a handful of Queensland primary producers - about 14 farmers in the North Burnett region.
Queensland Farmers Federation executive officer John Cherry hopes future announcements will have more benefits for his members.
And Western Australian farmers have missed out altogether because a state drought assistance scheme ends at a later date than state aid elsewhere.
Meanwhile a prominent Australian researcher says the drought is even worse than most of us think.
Professor Paul Perkins, from the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at the Australian National University, says our dry conditions are being mirrored in places like the western United States, Spain and Portugal.
He says Australia must learn to produce twice as much food with half the water, to help feed the world.
"It appears that in areas of the Northern Hemisphere, similar to ours, this summer just finishing has been much worse than 2002," he said.
"Which means you have got another bad summer coming in Australia, much worse than any since European settlement in Australia.
