Semi-black opals find excites miners
Miners in South Australia's remote outback are excited about a new find of rare, semi-black opals near Coober Pedy.
The gems have been unearthed in a field called Alan's Ridge, about 60 kilometres south of the town.
Opal miner John Dunstan says black opals are highly valuable, and can fetch up to $150,000 an ounce.
He says he could have made the find himself, if only he had kept working in the field a little bit longer.
"I left a claim down there a couple of months ago, I cancelled it and moved to another spot, and a couple of friends of mine went in there and decided to carry on a bit further and they found a nice parcel," he said.
"Bit of nice semi-black opal and quite valuable, so they're very happy, and actually I'm happy for them too.
