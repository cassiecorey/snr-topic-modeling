Aust wheat price surges on back of international season
There is finally some good news for grain growers today, with international competition driving a big surge in wheat prices for the 2006-07 season.
AWB has released its first price estimates for wheat delivered to the national pool next harvest, with the benchmark Australian Premium White Wheat sitting at $222 a tonne, up $30 on last season.
National Pool manager David Johnson says while prices can still change, Australia is in a good position to capitalise on lower world production figures.
"We have a much stronger fundamental story around hard wheats in particular at the moment, with the US hard red winter crop experiencing some production difficulties," he said.
