Cattle producers lean towards smaller exports
Cattle producers in the Northern Territory are leading a push towards smaller live export vessels, despite a growing number of large ships entering the trade.
Italian firm, Siba Ships, has enlarged its fleet with three new vessels, due to enter the trade by the end of next year.
Steve Ellison from the Northern Territory Livestock Exporters Association says he has been surprised to see a determined swing away from large ships, with their lower freight rates.
"We are getting a bit of a backlash from producers who would prefer to see (their cattle) go on the smaller ships," he said.
"I think that a lot of the producers realise that they think those big ships aren't quite all beer and skittles.
"In fact, I bought some cattle a few weeks ago and one of the provisos was that I had to give a guarantee that they wouldn't go on a big ship.
