Road infrastructure making it harder for grain transporters
Bulk grain transporters say Australia's road infrastructure is so poor they are having difficulty carting this year's reduced harvest from silos.
The Australian Livestock Transporters Association says its Western Australian and New South Wales grain carrier members are carrying more grain this year because rail operators have scaled back their harvest work.
Executive director Luke Fraser says a lot of the crucial network is not suitable for bulk carriers, so transporters face the expense and time delay of navigating a series of different state permit systems.
"We're finding it increasingly around the country," he said.
