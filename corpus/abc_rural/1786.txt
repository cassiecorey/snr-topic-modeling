Environmentalist honoured at Landcare awards
Environmentalist Rick Farley has been remembered at this year's national Landcare awards.
The award winners were announced last night in Melbourme.
One thousand people flew in from across Australia and as far as Africa to attend the event.
Eleven awards were handed out to farmers, schools, and shire councils for excellence in land conservation.
Western Australia dominated taking home three awards, New South Wales and South Australia two and one went to Tasmania, Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Governor-General Major General Michael Jeffery presented the ABC with an award for its support.
But for many whose lives were touched by the late Mr Farley, a co-founder of Landcare, it was the dedication of an international award in his name that was the highlight of the evening.
