Australian, NZ dairy farmers share research costs
They might be rivals in international trade but Australian and New Zealand dairy farmers are about to get a whole lot closer, with a new partnership to share research costs.
Following support from farmer organisations in both countries, Dairy Australia and New Zealand company Dairy Insight will focus on improving pre-farmgate research, including industry development, education and training.
The head of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, Allan Burgess, says it makes sense to reduce costs.
"We think there's very limited resources available for farmers and things we can do together are going to be more efficient," he said.
