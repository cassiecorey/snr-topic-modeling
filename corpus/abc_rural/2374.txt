Tas begins dairy cow exports to Pakistan
Tasmanian farmers are exporting live dairy cows to Pakistan for the first time.
About 1,000 cows are sent to China from Tasmania each year but that trade has slowed this season.
Livestock agent Craig Waldron says the new market looks promising, with Pakistan paying $800 a head for cross-bred heifers.
"Given the season on the current returns of what you can expect to buy replacement stock for, it's pretty reasonable to buy a female that was only just recently joined," he said.
