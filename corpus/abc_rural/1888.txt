Testing finds Aust wildlife free of bird flu
Ongoing testing across Australia's most susceptible regions have found no evidence of the new lethal strain of bird flu in wildlife.
Last year the H5N1 strain killed thousands of water fowl in China and this year it spread from birds to humans in Indonesia.
Dr John Curran, from the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, says continuing trapping and testing of wild birds across northern Australia has so far failed to isolate any live influenza viruses.
"But by the same token we're still concerned that the global epidemic is continuing and that this has actually come closer to, the epidemic has come closer to Australia through Indonesia," Dr Curran said.
