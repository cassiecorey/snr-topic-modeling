Wool bodies launch national mulesing assurance program
The wool industry's peak bodies have launched a national mulesing assurance program to try to reassure wool processors that animals are being treated humanely.
Australian Wool Innovation and Wool Producers will improve training for 1,200 mulesing contractors by the end of the year to minimise pain and suffering for animals.
Under the practice of mulesing, skin is cut from the backside of lambs to reduce the risk of flystrike.
Secretary of the program, Charlie De Fegely says the wool industry wants to show it has ethical standards.
"I've even heard of some contractors paying for their producers to do it simply because they want to have best practice and they don't want to be part of holding the industry back," he said.
