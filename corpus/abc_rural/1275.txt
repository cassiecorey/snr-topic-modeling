Snowy River to reap benefits of western water project
A big water-saving project is being officially opened in western New South Wales today, with benefits for the iconic Snowy River.
The $28 million redevelopment of the Barren Box Swamp near Griffith will save 20 gigalites of water.
It is one of the biggest projects funded under the New South Wales, Victorian and Federal Governments program to boost flows in the Snowy.
Murrumbidgee Irrigation chairman Dick Thompson says a natural wetland on the site is also being restored.
"We've already seen a lot of the bird life return," he said.
