Farmers brace for locust plagues
Victorian farmers are bracing for another summer of locust plagues, with hatchings set to begin this week.
The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has set up portable work stations so more staff can be sent to wherever the plagues are most severe.
Dr Malcolm Campbell from the DPI says the need for increased resources was the key lesson from last year's plague.
