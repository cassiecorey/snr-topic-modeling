Croc captured in Katherine main street
While the floodwaters are subsiding in the Northern Territory, it is taking longer to remove the visiting wildlife.
Last night, a metre-long freshwater crocodile was captured in the main street of Katherine
And at Mataranka Homestead, a hundred kilometres south, Deborah Moore says her place has become an ark.
"There's lots of kangaroos and peacocks and snakes and quite a few crocodiles around as well," she said.
