NLIS working at major saleyards
New figures show the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is working 99 per cent of the time at two of Queensland's major saleyards at Roma and Dalby.
The Australian Livestock and Property Agents Association says out of more than 650,000 head of cattle, less than 1 per cent either did not have electronic ear tags or had tags that were not read by scanners.
Spokesman Roger Lyne is pleased with the figures but says he expects them to improve.
"As time goes on people are learning how to put them in better, the application rates are much better and I think also the suppliers or manufacturers of the tags are also getting better at it," he said.
