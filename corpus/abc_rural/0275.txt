Call for bureaucrat or MP to act as AWB 'moral conscience'
The Queensland Nationals are calling for changes at the top of AWB to help protect the single desk for wheat exports.
Member for Hinkler Paul Neville wants a bureaucrat or government MP on AWB's board to act as its "moral conscience" to stop future kickback controversies.
Mr Neville says the appointment would prevent questions over AWB's integrity if it retains the single desk.
"It's important that its probity be above any form of suspicion," he said.
"For that reason I'd be more comfortable if we had a government appointee or someone from the public service on that board."
Meanwhile tough international wheat marketing conditions have been reflected in AWB's first payment to growers from the 2005-06 national pool.
The dividend of just over $30 per metric tonne for Australian premium white (APW) grade wheat represents just 16 per cent of the total price growers can expect to receive.
Tony Smith from Plumgrove Commodity Trading says first payments are usually much higher but buyers are not prepared to pay higher grain prices.
