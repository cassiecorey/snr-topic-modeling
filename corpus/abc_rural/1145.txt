Trip may have cleared up river diversion concerns
Local Aboriginal people may now be more open to the idea of expanding a Northern Territory lead and zinc mine.
Xstrata is currently seeking environmental approvals to move the McArthur River five and a half kilometres, so its mine can become an open-cut operation.
The company recently took a group of traditional owners to a coal mine in Victoria to see first hand what river diversion involves.
John Moriarty, the chairman of the Borroloola Community Reference Group, thinks the trip might have cleared up some concerns.
