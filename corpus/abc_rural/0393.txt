WA native title battle resolved
A 12-year native title battle surrounding the Western Australian town of Broome has finally been resolved.
The Federal Court has recognised the Yawuru people as the rightful native title holders of land surrounding Broome.
The full effect of native title will take place on the Indigenous-owned cattle property, Roebuck Station, while the neighbouring property, Thangoo Station, will continue to operate as a privately-owned lease.
Fred Chaney from the Native Title Tribunal says the decision also extends to areas like the famous Cable Beach.
"The beach is of course a very significant feature of Broome and that is an area where you can't have exclusive possession the court found but where the Aboriginal people have continuing traditional interests which they share with the general community," he said.
"There are areas of town where native title has been found to survive (in other words not extinguished) and there are very large areas outside town, in particular the Aboriginal owned pastoral property which has exclusive possession native title."
