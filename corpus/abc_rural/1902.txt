CBH set to launch wheat export pool
Australia's troubled wheat exporter AWB has another force to deal with today with Western Australia's largest grain bulk handler, CBH, attempting to launch a wheat export pool of its own this harvest.
As Western Australian growers consider how they will sell their wheat crop this season, the company today has launched an export licence to test the power of veto that AWB has over its single desk licence.
A previous attempt and subsequent appeal by CBH last December were lost.
CBH chief executive Imre Mencshelyi says the new move will not undermine the single desk and will put more money into growers pockets this season.
"We've agonised over that decision for sometime and today we're launching the CBH wheat pool for 2 million tonne volume for West Australian grain growers," he said.
"At the end of the day we recognise there'll be divided opinion on what we'll be putting out in the market place but the growers will have this opportunity to deliver and they'll vote by their actions."
AWB's Ian Donges says that the export application is an attack on the single desk, and will not necessarily result in growers being paid a higher price over the life of the proposed CBH pool.
Meanwhile, AWB has increased its new season pool returns for premium wheat to $245 a tonne, up $5.
