CCC investigates further misconduct
Western Australia's Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) has revealed it has further evidence of serious misconduct and abuse of power by public officers.
The revelation follows yesterday's startling evidence at the CCC of secretly recorded phone conversations between the former minister Norm Marlborough and the former premier Brian Burke.
The CCC inquiry was originally set up to investigate the handling of a proposal to build a tourist resort at Smiths Beach, near Yallingup.
But the uncovering of secret phone conversations between Mr Marlborough and Mr Burke has now changed the nature and course of the inquiry.
Yesterday CCC lawyer Stephen Hall SC revealed the commission had for some time been undertaking broader investigations.
He said the investigations supported the proposition that serious misconduct by public officers has, may have, or is occurring.
Mr Hall said the investigation had been given the highest priority because of the need to protect the integrity of government in Western Australia.
