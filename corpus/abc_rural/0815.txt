Citrus canker report recommends AQIS changes
A Senate report into the Queensland citrus canker outbreak has recommended the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) respond to allegations of breaches of quarantine in fewer than three working days.
The five recommendations also included police training for some AQIS staff and an overhaul of the National Management Group for pest incursions.
The Senate rural and regional affairs committee found citrus canker had destroyed 500,000 trees around Emerald in Central Queensland, and cost the region $70 million.
Managing director of 2PH farms, John Pressler, lost more than 250,000 trees to canker, but says he is not surprised no-one was charged over the outbreak.
"It's really only subsequent to the Senate inquiry that the investigators actually revisited the whole scene," he said.
"By this time, a whole lot of evidence and information is missing, so it's not surprising, it's just another indictment against the way AQIS performed in this entire charade."
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says he will carefully consider the findings of the Senate report, and believes at least two of the recommendations make good sense.
He has defended AQIS against criticism that it was too slow to investigate reports of illegal imports of citrus budwood.
"I don't agree with the criticisms of AQIS. These investigations were conducted professionally and thoroughly," he said.
