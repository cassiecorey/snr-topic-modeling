Court closes chapter on native title claims
Members of the Federal Court have donned heavy black robes in 40 degree heat to close a chapter on a series of long-running native title claims in north Western Australia.
At a small community outside of Kununurra, the court granted native title to almost 7,000 square kilometres of the East Kimberley, bringing the total land under native title in the region to 35 per cent.
Edna O'Malley from the Miriuwung Gajerrong Corporation says the ruling not only allows access to country but will bring economic benefits in the future.
"Like the judge said today, it was only a pen to the paper to end 12 years of hard struggle," she said.
