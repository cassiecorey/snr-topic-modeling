1080 poison not under threat in animal welfare strategy
Humane control methods will have to be used in the battle against pest animals, under the new Australian animal welfare strategy.
The strategy, to be finalised by the end of the year, will emphasise the need for ongoing training and accreditation in pest control, whether it be for wild dogs or cane toads.
But Tony English from the Wild Animal Working Group says the widely used toxin 1080 is not under threat at this stage.
"Not in the short term - 1080 at the moment is still too valuable a toxin for us for use in say wild dogs and foxes, that there's no suggestion at all that we would be looking to phase out 1080," he said.
"We can start to look for new toxins and that's happening but there is some research being done to incorporate analgesic drugs, pain killing drugs with the 1080 to make it perhaps more humane than it currently is.
