Former AWB executive disputes colleague's evidence
A former AWB executive has denied to the Cole inquiry that he hatched a plan with the Iraqi Grains Board in October 2000 to set up a scheme through which trucking fees would be paid.
AWB's former general manager for marketing, Charles Stott, has told the hearing he rejects evidence given last week by his former colleague, Dominic Hogan.
Senior counsel assisting the inquiry, John Agius QC, went straight to an October 2000 series of handwritten notes and letters involving a meeting with Mr Hogan, Mr Stott and the Iraqi Minister for Trade.
Mr Stott refuted Mr Hogan's claim that he had anything to do with the establishment of an incentives scheme through which trucking fees would be paid.
Mr Agius then asked Mr Stott if he was suggesting that Mr Hogan's notes were made up.
Mr Stott then replied: "I have absolutely no idea.
"I don't know where they were drafted, I'm not even sure he took notes."
