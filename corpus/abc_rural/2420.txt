MIS plantation forestry tax incentives to stay
The Federal Government has decided not to remove tax advantages for investors in plantation forestry under managed investment schemes (MIS).
But under new changes it will change the law, to ensure that at least 70 per cent of investor's money is spent on trees, instead of other projects.
Farmers believe the scheme creates unfair competition for land and water, but assistant treasurer Peter Dutton says the farm sector also receives help.
"The Government has put in place a deliberate strategy to make sure that we support the forestry industry," he said.
"At the same time we have provided many other tax incentives and support through the tax system and government policies and otherwise for traditional farming measures such as the Farm Management Deposit Account so it's about providing a balance."
The Government has also launched a three-month review of the taxation of non-forestry MIS for crops such as grapes and tomatoes.
But there is criticism from the investment and the farm sector over the continuation of the timber tax deductions.
Former rural banker and agricultural business consultant David Cornish says the Government has done nothing to address community concerns over the impact of plantations.
He says traditional farm enterprises are being overlooked.
"These are just massive tax distortions or subsidies which are leading to distortion of capital into rural Australia," he said.
