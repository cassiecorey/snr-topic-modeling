US company tests South Korean import protocols
A shipment of US beef has arrived in South Korea for the first time in nearly three years but exporters appear nervous about the future of the market.
The US Agriculture Department says the consignment is from a company testing new import protocols designed to minimise the risk of mad cow disease.
But other companies are waiting to see how it is received in a market now dominated by Australia.
US Department of Agriculture Deputy Undersecretary Chuck Lambert says despite Korea's market reopening to US boneless beef on September 11 after a 2003 mad cow case, the US industry remains reluctant to ship, even though one US firm shipped nine tonnes this week.
"The reluctance to ship has been by the US industry, related to concerns about how Korea might handle findings of small pieces of bone, or bone chips. We have had one company who has elected to test the system," he said.
Mr Lambert is still waiting on Seoul for a response to his letter, asking the Koreans for more flexibility in how they deal with bone chips, cartilage and muscle membrane.
Korea's major retailers are not placing orders for the U-S beef.
Quarantine authorities will take the next 10 days to inspect the first shipment for bone fragments.
But Meat and Livestock Australia's regional manager in Korea Glen Feist says Korean retail chains are not yet ready to welcome back US product.
"Obviously over the last nearly three years now we've made very strong relationships with these guys and they're all indicating to us that they'll take a wait and see attitude as well," he said.
