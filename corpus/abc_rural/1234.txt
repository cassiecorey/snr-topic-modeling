Scientist calls on SA farmers to collect rabbit livers
A South Australian scientist is calling on landholders across the country to collect the livers from dead rabbits found on their properties.
In October it will be 10 years since the calici virus was released in South Australia in an attempt to control rabbit numbers.
Ron Sinclair from the state's Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity says the livers will help researchers find out how the virus has evolved and whether it is still effective.
"It's not a very nice thing to do, to chop open a rabbit and take out a bit of liver, but we only need a little piece, about maybe a thumbnail size, chucked in a bottle and thrown into a freezer labelled and then call the local authority responsible for animal or plant control and let them know they have one," he said.
