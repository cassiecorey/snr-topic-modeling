Water trading available for southern Qld farmers
Queensland has given the go ahead for its first water trading scheme involving river systems.
Previously farmers could only buy water attached to land or from government-run irrigation schemes.
Water trading will now be introduced across the Moonie and Warrego catchments in southern Queensland.
An entitlement to access 120 megalitres a day from the Moonie River will be auctioned next month and Clayton Smith from Elders believes it could sell for well over $2 million.
"Existing irrigators will be keen to get more water to do more development on their properties and secure their future," he said.
