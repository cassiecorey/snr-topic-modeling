Put down malnourished stock: RSPCA
The RSPCA is calling on sheep and cattle producers to put down any livestock which are falling down due to lack of feed or water.
The call comes after a Western Australian livestock producer was fined $25,000 after being charged with six counts of animal cruelty.
The RSPCA says it found some sheep dead in a paddock, while officers were forced to put down another six.
RSPCA prosecutor Robin Moore says all producers have a responsibility to livestock and the drought is not an excuse for mistreatment.
