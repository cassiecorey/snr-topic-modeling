Abalone farm keen to restock after virus
An abalone farm is attempting to get its business back on track after the discovery of a herpes-like virus on the south-west coast of Victoria earlier this year.
Port Fairy's Southern Ocean Mariculture voluntarily destocked three million abalone to prevent the disease spreading.
The company says tests during the past six weeks have shown the farm is now free of the virus.
General manager Mark Jervis says an application to move stock back onto the farm needs to be approved by the Victorian Government
