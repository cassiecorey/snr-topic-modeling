PigPass to identify food safety risks
Pork producers have welcomed a new identification system to trace animals from pig pen to plate.
PigPass is a national vendor declaration form which must accompany pigs being processed for domestic and export markets.
It is being rolled out now and should be fully in place by January 2007.
David Miles from the Victorian Farmers Federation's pig group says any disease or food safety risks will be identified with the new pass.
"There's got to be traceback. If we haven't got traceability well we're not going to be able to export or do anything professionally and it will control the industry, as I understand, and the VFF pig group we're quite happy with this," he said.
