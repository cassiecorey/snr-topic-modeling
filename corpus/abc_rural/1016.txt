PM asked to slow down water trading
Farmers in Victoria's Goulburn Valley have called on the Prime Minister to slow down the pace of water trading in order to stop it destroying local farms.
The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for water, Malcolm Turnbull, has met farmers in Shepparton.
They have told him they cannot compete for local water which is being sent down the Murray to irrigate vineyards and almond farms, and that they enjoy tax breaks through managed investment schemes (MIS).
Mr Turnbull says he will raise the issue with Mr Howard.
"I'll take back to the PM the concern that there is in the community, that the managed investment schemes have certain tax advantages," he said.
