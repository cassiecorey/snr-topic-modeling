Fortescue gains access to BHP Billiton rail lines
The Federal Court has given Fortescue Metals Group open access to BHP Billiton's iron ore rail lines in Western Australia's Pilbara region.
The decision means BHP Billiton can no longer stop other companies from using the Mount Newman and Goldsworthy rail lines, despite claiming them as part of its own production process.
Foretescue has successfully argued that the lines were a 'service', under the Trade Practices Act and should be available to all companies who need them.
Fortescue spokesman Graeme Rowley says the court has upheld a right to fair competition.
"We not only now have achieved success for ourselves, but we've also achieved success for Australia," he said.
"We now go to the Australian Competition Tribunal to ask them to approve effectively our access to that infrastructure.
"That overturns the Treasurer's decision that we could not have that access."
