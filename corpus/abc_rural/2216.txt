Cattle processors in for rough ride: AMH chief
One of the country's biggest meat processors says meatworks in southern Australia could close due to falling cattle numbers.
The chief executive of Australia Meat Holdings (AMH), John Keir, has seized upon Meat and Livestock Australia figures that show slaughter rates could fall by as much as 800,000 head next year.
Mr Keir says with too many abattoirs and too few cattle, processors will face very tough times.
"I mean if we're going to see a reduction in the herd and therefor a reduction in slaughter numbers there will be surplus capacity," he said.
