Report recommends GM grass for dairy cows
The South Australian Dairyfarmers Association says it will support the introduction of genetically modified (GM) pasture grasses if consumers accept them.
A leaked draft report for the Australian Dairy Industry Council recommends introducing GM grass for dairy cows, after research pointing to massive productivity gains from the new technology.
SA association president, David Basham, says the industry needs to do more investigation.
"We need to keep that research going, we need to make sure that if consumers are ready to move on, we are there ready to adopt," he said.
"If the markets are not willing to accept GM products then we as an industry can't accept it and that may be the way it goes."
And there are deeply divided views on GM pastures in Victoria.
