Agforce chief expresses Qld vote concerns
Queensland's rural leaders have expressed disappointment with the Beattie Government's big win at the weekend's state election.
Despite the double crisis confronting Queensland's health system and water supply, Peter Beattie has won 59 seats, a huge majority of 33 in the 89-member Parliament.
The blood-letting is under way in the Opposition parties, with National Party leader Lawrence Springborg possibly to be replaced by his deputy Jeff Seeney.
Afgorce CEO Brett de Hayr says many people in the rural sector would have liked to have seen a more balanced Parliament elected.
"It just showed that people probably thought Labor was the less worse option on the day," he said.
"I don't think there were any resounding signs of support for anyone in this campaign."
