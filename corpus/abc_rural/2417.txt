Woolworths CEO details drought relief strategy
Sustainable agriculture, drought relief and climate change are the three issues dominating the agenda for the new boss of Woolworths.
Chief executive Michael Luscombe says the supermarket chain has plans to create 'green supermarkets', improve the company's waste management and reward producers whose farms are environmentally friendly.
Mr Luscombe says in the short-term, the company is working with the Country Women's Association on a special drought relief project.
"We have decided that we're going to have a national drought relief action day on the 23rd of January," he said.
"And on that particular day in 760 supermarkets we're going to donate the profit from that entire day's sales to drought relief."
