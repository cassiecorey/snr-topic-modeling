Wheat growers to be consulted over changes to single desk
The Deputy Prime Minister says the Federal Government will consult wheat growers, before making any changes to the single desk export system.
Western Australian MP Wilson Tuckey is threatening to introduce a private member's Bill in the Senate, calling for the removal of AWB's power to veto export applications.
Other Government MPs are also calling for the veto to be removed once the Cole inquiry report is handed down.
But Mark Vaile says the Government is not going to be rushed into any hasty decisions.
"The Cole inquiry is focused on the activities of three companies, what you're talking to me about now is the future arrangements to manage and market the Australian wheat crop," he said.
