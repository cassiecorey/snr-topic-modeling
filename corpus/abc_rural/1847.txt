Concerns govt regulations limiting mining investments
The Western Australian minerals exploration sector claims government regulations are costing the state billions of dollars in lost investments.
WA has recorded its lowest ever level of exploration spending, while other states, like New South Wales and South Australia, have almost doubled theirs.
Justin Wolawski, from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, says Western Australia has a reputation as a difficult place to do business due to native title and environmental constraints.
"The mineral exploration and mining industry takes up point zero three percent of the states land mass, it's a minuscule amount of the state," he said.
"But what's in front of mineral exploration and mining companies in some cases is approval of both houses of Parliament, approval from the Minister of Environment, and then further impediments alongside there.
