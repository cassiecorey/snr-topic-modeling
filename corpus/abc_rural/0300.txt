Wheat bug discovery prompts questions
Australian apple growers say the discovery of the wheat bug in Holland and Belgium raises new questions about the risks posed by New Zealand apple imports.
Biosecurity Australia is considering 34 submissions on the proposal to allow kiwi apples into Australia.
Chairman of Apple and Pear Australia Darral Ashton says the wheat bug is endemic in New Zealand and should be given greater consideration.
"News out of both Belgium and Holland that that wheat bug has been found and they are saying it arrived hitchhiking on New Zealand apples or New Zealand apple packaging," he said.
"Whether that's true or not I don't know but it just highlights the concern that one of the processes has to be fumigation because while wheat bug may not affect the Batlow or the Australian apple and pear industry it would sure as hell play havoc on the Australian wheat industry."
