Wave Hill walk-off celebrations under way
It has been 40 years since the Wave Hill walk-off, a protest which led to the Indigenous rights movement in Australia.
Celebrations have begun in the remote Northern Territory of Kalkaringi, 800km south-west of Darwin.
An overwhelming mood of friendship and reconciliation binds more than 1,500 people gathered by the Victoria River, the site where stockman Vincent Lingiari led his people on strike in 1966.
Originally protesting against the pay conditions on nearby Wave Hill Station, the nine-year strike soon became a battle for land rights.
Among the crowd today were descendants of the original Gurindgi strikers, pastoralists, politicians and visitors from across the country.
As part of the festival an agreement is being signed between the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, the Northern Territory Government, the Land Councils and the Indigenous Land Corporation to boost Aboriginal participation in the pastoral industry.
