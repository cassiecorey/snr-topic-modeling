Beef exporters brace for US competition
The United States is hoping to cut Australia's $500 million beef market to South Korea when exports resume next week.
Meat and Livestock Australia's regional manager in Korea Glenn Feist says exporters are bracing themselves for major competition for the first time in more than two years.
He expects to see export levels drop but hopes Australia will be able to hold onto a market share of around 50 per cent.
"Australia won brand of the year twice in a row here with the country of origin labelling with our statement: 'Australian beef clean and safe'," he said.
"But since the US has been out it has given us an opportunity and we grow beef for the five star dining hotels and that sort of stuff - we have got manufacturing beef for the McDonald's and the Burger King [chains] and those guys.
"So I think we will hold our own pretty well up here."
The Cattle Council says Australian producers are likely to retain their stronghold on the market for bone-in beef in Korea.
The amount of US beef allowed in will be limited by a continuing ban on cattle over 30 months of age, which will help Australia remain competitive, according to council president Bill Bray.
"The main trade in beef into Korea has been the bone-in short rib and we've been asked to continue to supply that because we have the highest freedom-ranking for BSE in the world," he said.
