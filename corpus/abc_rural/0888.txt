Farming practices blamed for looming mice plague
No-till farming practices and left over seed from last harvest are being blamed for a looming mice plague on South Australia's upper Eyre Peninsula.
Surveys have shown more than 4,000 mice per hectare, the highest number since 1995.
Unlike conventional seeding, sowing crops with the no-till method leaves one distinct furrow for mice to follow and burrow into to eat grain.
Buckleboo farmer Jim Hamlin says the mice are just another problem when they are already facing a cold, dry start to the season.
"Where some of the crops are up, they're chewing off leaves and in other places, where the crops are not up, they've dug under the ground and got the grain as well," he said.
