Mulesing alternatives available from 2007: AWI
Two alternatives to mulesing will be available for farmers by 2007 and 2008 respectively, beating the 2010 deadline set between wool growers and animal rights group PETA.
Wool Research body Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) had its trials set back earlier this year when the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service rejected a key product, collagenase as a biosecurity threat.
But head of blowfly control at AWI, Jules Dorrian, says a new product, producing similar results, has received the all clear.
