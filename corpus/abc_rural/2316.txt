Govt not dealing quickly enough with global warming concerns: Garrett
The Opposition's new environment spokesman says a federal Labor Government would be more responsive to farmers' concerns about climate change.
Peter Garrett, a former head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, was appointed in Kevin Rudd's weekend frontbench reshuffle.
Others with new portfolios relevant to rural Australia include Kerry O'Brien in primary industries, Simon Crean in trade and regional development, Anthony Albanese in water, and Chris Evans in resources.
Mr Garrett says the Federal Government is not dealing quickly enough with community concerns about global warming.
