Farmers to vote on Dairy Australia levy
Dairy farmers will vote for the first time early next year on how much they should pay to peak body Dairy Australia.
Producers currently pay a levy of one-third of a cent per litre to fund research and development, marketing and trade issues.
The levy totals $32 million a year.
Dairy Australia's John McKew says the levy will have to increase just to maintain current work.
"They have to start thinking about it now," he said.
"As their national services body Dairy Australia, how are we going to fund the services that we currently have which are imperative for the industry, but also what are we going to do about the issues which are on our doorstep or on the cusp of it, issues that we need to manage as an industry moving forward?.
