Commodity exports' earnings booming
Earnings from commodity exports are booming even more than expected this year, largely thanks to the minerals and energy sector, according to the latest figures.
Australia's Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) predicts commodity exports will rise 16 per cent this year, more than double its original forecast issued at the Outlook Conference in February.
The increase is thanks to a strong minerals and energy sector which is now expected to earn $48 billion - up $4 billion on the February forecast.
It is a different story for farm commodities though with the February forecast of $29.6 billion downgraded slightly.
