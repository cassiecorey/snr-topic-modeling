CSIRO begins researching grape quality potential
New equipment is being developed to measure the potential quality of grapes before they are harvested.
The CSIRO has been researching the links between grapes and the quality of the wine they produce, using chemical and sensory analysis.
It is hoped the research can be used to develop bio-sensor technology, which will be used to test grapes at the vineyard or weighbridge.
CSIRO scientist Dr Aggie Cox says that should help growers receive fairer prices.
"What we're basically trying to do is look for things that we can measure to be able to tell us what sort of wines those grapes can produce," he said.
"And the reason we're doing that is to try and make the wine a lot more consistent so the winemakers have some sort of idea of what that parcel of grape is potentially able to produce in the end.
