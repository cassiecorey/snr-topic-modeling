Natural Resources defends water cutbacks
The NSW Department of Natural Resources has defended the way it cut back water allocations to 80 per cent for Murray Valley Irrigators. The announcement on Sunday shocked many farmers because it came without warning. Executive director for water management David Harriss explains it has been a complex issue to work through. He claims they could not flag the cut in entitlement to irrigators because it would have breached commercial confidence. The reductions will apply only to water still in users' accounts, and aren't calculated on the full entitlement.
