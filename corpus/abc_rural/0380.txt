Studies to investigate GM crop issues
The Federal Government has placed further pressure on the states to lift their bans on genetically modified crops by announcing eight case studies into the sector's most contentious issues.
The studies will be done by the Bureau of Rural Sciences and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, and the private sector will contribute.
There will be four different reports on the impacts of releasing genetically modified canola, while weed control and the affect on organic farmers will also be considered.
