Blair attacks EU trade policies
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has used an address to the Australian Parliament to attack the European Union's protectionist trade policies on farm goods.
Mr Blair says despite some gains in trade reform, a tide of protectionist sentiment is still flowing around the world.
The PM has also singled out the closed trade policies of the United States and Japan, saying the future of all trade negotiations hinges on the current Doha round of talks.
"If we can't put a decent trade round in place, when it is so plain that our long-term national interest and the wider interest of the world demand it, this will be a failure with multiple consequences, all of them adverse," Mr Blair said.
