Calicivirus having an impact around Alice
Research is showing that a re-release of the rabbit killing calicivirus is having an effect near Alice Springs.
Rabbit numbers have increased dramatically in recent years, amid fears the disease is losing its effectiveness.
Kym Schwartzkopff from Parks and Wildlife says a number of rabbits have died since the re-release, but the disease has not spread as far as hoped.
"The main stop of the spread is usually caused through weather, it does seem to work a lot better within a mild climate where it's a lot cooler and a bit more humidity around and a bit more moisture around and the high temperatures that we have in the centre of Australia and also through the desert regions make it go dormant.
