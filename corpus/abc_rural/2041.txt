Democrats' victory makes trade deals harder: consultant
With the Democrats sweeping back into power in the US Congress, the Bush administration faces a major challenge to its power to broker trade deals next year.
The Congress, even in Republican hands, has passed recent trade deals by the narrowest of margins.
Now, with Democrats in charge, Democratic trade consultant and former US Agriculture Department trade adviser Paul Drazek sees little hope for renewing the President's power to make trade deals, expiring next July.
"I think the changes of his getting that approval are pretty remote now. I mean, why would the Democrats in the House want to give the President a victory on a trade issue ... effectively, 18 months before the next election," Mr Drazek said.
