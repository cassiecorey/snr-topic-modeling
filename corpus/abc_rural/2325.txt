Bass Coast applies for EC assistance
One of the greenest parts of southern Australia is now putting its hand up for exceptional circumstances (EC) drought assistance.
Farmers on the Bass Coast in southern Victoria say they are suffering one of the worst seasons on record.
Stephanie Symes from the Bass Coast Shire Council says district farmers are used to much wetter conditions.
"It's the first time we've ever had stage four water restrictions applied," she said.
