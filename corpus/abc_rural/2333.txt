Howard visits Vic firefighters
Prime Minister John Howard has visited firefighters in north-east Victoria, as they continue to battle bushfires which have now burnt 400,000 hectares.
Thick smoke covered Whitfield as residents and Country Fire Authority (CFA) volunteers met with the Prime Minister today.
Made up of beef properties and vineyards, the Whitfield area in the north-east of Victoria has been threatened by fire since lightning strikes hit there a week and a half ago.
John Howard has thanked firefighters for their work, and got a briefing on the fire conditions which are expected to last many weeks.
He also spoke with locals, mostly women, who are busy making cups of tea and sandwiches for the crew.
He will visit the fire ground before flying to Tasmania, where he is expected to make a funding announcement.
Meanwhile cooler weather on Tasmania's east coast is helping firefighters control a bushfire which has burnt more than 11,500 hectares and destroyed 17 homes.
Firefighters are working to contain the fire ahead of forecast hotter and winder conditions tomorrow.
Farmer Stephen Woods, whose two farms near Scamander were already hit by drought, has saved his livestock, but lost more than 100,000 of pasture and another 700 hectares of bush.
