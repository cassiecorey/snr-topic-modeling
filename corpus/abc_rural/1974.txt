Aboriginal land subdivided for farming
In a first for the Northern Territory, Aboriginal land has been subdivided for horticulture development.
It has taken more than 10 years to develop the new leases due to a lack of funding.
Five blocks of between 100 to 1,000 hectares at Ti-Tree, north of Alice Springs, will be leased to farmers for development.
Allan Cooney from Centrefarm says the plan will increase the productivity of unimproved land, with plans to grow olives, mangoes, tablegrapes and bush tucker.
"We would expect there to be fruit planted here next year, albeit on a relatively small scale but within a couple of years we'll see extensive plantings in these areas," he said.
"We've got people that have been lined up for years ready to go onto these sites.
