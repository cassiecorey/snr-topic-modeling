Tas restaurateurs struggle to buy local fish
Tasmanian restaurants are finding it hard to buy local fish, with high operating costs forcing vessels out of the industry.
Fishermen are now choosing to sell the smaller catch to mainland markets at a premium price, rather than supply local restaurants.
And with more fishermen preparing to leave the sector under a Federal Government licence buy-back, Will Mure from Mure's Fishing in Hobart says the trend will continue.
"I guess it's just coming terms with the fact that the fishing industry is going through some fairly serious changes right now and that the price of local quality produce, you'll have to pay a premium price for it," he said.
