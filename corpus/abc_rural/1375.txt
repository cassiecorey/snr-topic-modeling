Oil exploration causes diver shortage
Increasing exploration for offshore oil reserves is causing a shortage of divers in the aquaculture industry.
Divers are being offered more than $300,000 a year for exploration work, compared $70,000 for work in the tuna and abalone sectors.
Martin Phillips, from South Australian Underwater Training, says oil exploration has not been a traditional job market for divers.
"Offshore jobs have been extremely difficult to get, you really had to know someone in that industry to get a job offshore," he said.
