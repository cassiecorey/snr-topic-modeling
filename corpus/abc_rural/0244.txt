Riverland citrus growers locked out of Indonesian trade
Citrus growers in South Australia's Riverland have been locked out of selling fruit to Indonesia despite being free of fruit fly.
Australia's $35 million fruit and vegetable trade with Indonesia is at a standstill because of new import protocols designed to address fruit fly concerns.
The Riverland's fruit fly-free status is recognised by other Asian markets like Japan and Taiwan but not by Indonesia's newly imposed quarantine protocols.
Judith Damiani from Australian Citrus Growers says it is an important market.
"It's not one of our largest markets in terms of volume or value but we do send quite a significant amount of mandarins and valencias as well," she said.
