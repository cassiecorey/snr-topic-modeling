Increased pay helps retain mango pickers
Improved wages have helped to secure pickers for the Northern Territory's mango season.
The NT Mango Association has set a recommended minimum wage of $16.50 this year, more than a dollar above the national award.
President Peter Marks says there are not many pickers around but the incentive has helped to keep workers on for the whole season.
"We had the unions involved, we had Aboriginal organisations involved and all the labour providers," he said.
"We asked their opinion how we should manage this situation because we could see it was not going to be good.
