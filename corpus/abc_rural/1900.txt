Captive breeding set to boost tuna stocks
A South Australian company says it could duplicate Australia's entire wild catch of more than 5,000 tonnes of tuna within a decade through captive breeding.
This follows the successful airlift of nine southern bluefin tuna from offshore sea cages into a $6 million tank built by Clean Seas Tuna at Arno Bay.
The fish will be used to spawn millions of eggs for harvesting in the world's first captive breeding program for the species.
Chairman Hagen Stehr says he could not put a price on the brood stock.
