Graincorp's profit jumps
Eastern Australian bulk grain handler Graincorp has announced a full year after-tax profit of $39.5 million.
The result is a whopping 193 per cent higher than last year's result.
Managing director Tom Keene says the good outcome has allowed the company to pay a dividend of 50 cents a share and pay off $55 million of debt.
But with only 1.9 million tonnes of grain currently in the system, he says the company is forecasting a bleak 2007.
"The outlook for the current year reflects the extensive drought conditions [and] we have already provided guidance on our FY07 [2007 financial year] of a loss of between $20 to $30 million," he said.
"As part of our strategy to manage this we continue to reduce our costs and focus on revenue improvement in a number of our business units."
