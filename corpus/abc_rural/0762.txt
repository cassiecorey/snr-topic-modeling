Re-structure talks on the cards for peak seafood group
The future of the nation's peak seafood lobby group is uncertain, after directors placed the Australian Seafood Industry Council into voluntary receivership.
A funding shortfall from voluntary levies and a lack of communication is being blamed for its demise.
Territory representative Rob Fish says the industry is expected to meet within four weeks to discuss re-structuring.
"I am not aware of many industry associations that can work on voluntary contributions," he said.
"Most are levied across the industry, providing with constant budgets, so you can budget across. Without that, I can't see it working myself.
