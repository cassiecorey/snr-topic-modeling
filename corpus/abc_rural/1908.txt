Wine glut prompts call for structural change
A new report on Australia's wine industry says our stocks have ballooned to an estimated two billion litres, as global wine production grows faster then demand.
The study by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics also warns Australia has no ability to influence the world wine market, because it has only 5 per cent of global production.
Chris Byrne, from the Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association, says serious structural change is needed.
"We're producing more than double the amount of wine grapes we need from those regions that cannot afford to grow popular premium products," he said.
"You have to solve that by working with growers and wine-makers to decide which regions cannot be sustainable.
