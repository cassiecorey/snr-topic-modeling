Inland rail link inches forward
The Federal Government says a new inland rail network linking Brisbane and Melbourne will need to be built, to cope with growing freight demand on road and existing rail networks.
Transport Minister Warren Truss has released a 15-month study into the project, and says the far western sub-corridor is the top contender from four routes named in the report.
The project will cost more than $3 billion, and taxpayers will need to contribute two thirds.
The Federal Government wants the line to be in operation by 2019.
Minister Truss says there will be consultation on the best route, but one is a particular stand-out.
"Now that particular corridor would cost about 3.1 billion dollars to build and achieve a transit time of just under 21 hours," he said.
