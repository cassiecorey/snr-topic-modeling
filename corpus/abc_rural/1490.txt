China accepts Aust citrus shipment
China has accepted Australia's first official shipment of citrus fruit.
A container of Queensland murcott mandarins have been sent overseas under strict new quarantine protocols, which include on-farm inspections and cold sterilisation.
In the past, fruit has entered China through Hong Kong.
Kevin Parr from Australian Citrus Growers says oranges from southern growing regions have not met the new protocols so far, so mandarin growers can now capitalise on the new export market.
"There's about 15 containers on the water at the moment that are going to arrive over the next fortnight, and one more going today, so I think it's a total of about 15-16 containers," he said.
