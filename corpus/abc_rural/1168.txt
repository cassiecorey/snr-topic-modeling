Irrigators push for bore water sales to Toowoomba
Irrigators on Queensland's Darling Downs say they will push ahead with a plan to sell water to the Toowoomba City Council, after residents overwhelmingly voted against using recycled water.
At a referendum on Saturday, 62 per cent of Toowoomba residents said they were not prepared to use treated waste water to alleviate shortages.
John McVeigh, from lobby group NuWater, says irrigators can sell 5,000 megalitres of bore water to the city each year.
"Irrigators in our part of the world have put on the table a concept of urban rural water trade, now that's a concept that is getting support from CSIRO and is certainly something that has been practised in Israel and California," he said.
