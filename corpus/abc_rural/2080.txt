Dairy farmers to vote on R&D contribution
Australia's 6,000 dairy farmers will go to the polls early next March to vote on how much they are willing to contribute to research and development.
Farmers pay 0.32 cents per litre of milk sold which, coupled with Federal Government support, generates around $50 million a year.
Pat Rowley from Dairy Australia says it is hard to ask farmers to step up their financial support during the drought but it is critical for the industry's future.
