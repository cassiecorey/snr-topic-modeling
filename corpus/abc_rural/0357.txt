Study spell trouble for single desk: Opposition
The Federal Opposition says the Government is carrying out a 'hatchet job' on the wheat export system by funding a study which it believes will call for the removal of the single desk.
Opposition agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor says grains industry think tank, Single Vision Australia, has commissioned a report into the single desk.
Single Vision is funded by the Government through the Grains Research and Development Corporation and has asked the Centre for International Economics to carry out research into the wheat export system.
And Mr O'Connor says that spells trouble for the single desk.
"It's the sort of organisation I think you employ when you want a hatchet job on the issue," he said.
The Government denies it had anything to do with setting up the report.
And Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says while the Government will consider its findings, it will not necessarily become policy.
"It will be an interesting read and whether or not it ever becomes public policy I wouldn't know," he said.
The report is due for release in the next few weeks.
Meanwhile hundreds of grain growers from across Western Australia have gathered in the wheatbelt town on Cunderdin to show support for the single desk.
Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile is also there to listen to farmers' concerns.
Brookton farmer Wanda Mattingly says WA growers want to send a clear message to Prime Minister John Howard that he needs to protect the current system.
"If we don't do something and then we sit back and whinge about it then we are our own worst enemies," he said.
