Cattlemen unable to find murdered teen
Cattlemen in Victoria's Barmah forest have been unable to assist police in finding a murdered teenager missing since April last year.
Detectives asked the cattlemen to keep an eye out during their annual muster at the weekend.
Raymond Allen, 17, from Mooroopna, is believed to have been killed and buried in the forest on the banks on the Murray River.
But Kelvin Trickey from the Barmah Cattlemen's Association says nothing was found.
"We haven't detected anything at all ... we're always tracking for cattle, looking for foot marks and that all through the bush," he said.
