Govt urged to take its time negotiating China FTA
Farmers are warning the Federal Government to take its time negotiating a free trade deal with China after a push by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to accelerate talks.
China's demand for Australian farm produce has tripled in the past decade and is now worth more than $3 billion to local farmers.
Premier Wen is in Canberra to among other things push the free trade negotiations forward.
But Ian James from vegetable grower group Ausveg is warning slow and steady could be better approach.
"Our concerns would be that in the past that basically Australian agriculture probably hasn't done as well as what most people would have expected," he said.
National Farmers Federation president Peter Corish says farmers want a deal soon but not at the expense of a complete agreement which includes farm goods.
"That of course is a good thing for Australian agriculture as long as we get a comprehensive deal that includes agriculture at the end of the day," he said.
Trade Minister Mark Vaile says he will not be rushed and will only settle for a comprehensive deal that includes agriculture.
Meanwhile the uranium industry says it welcomes a move to export yellowcake to China but will not support price regulation.
Premier Wen has floated the idea of price fixing to stop the cost of uranium rising too high like other raw materials including coal and iron ore.
But Ian Hore-Lacy from the Uranium Information Centre says resource deals are commercial contracts, driven by market forces.
