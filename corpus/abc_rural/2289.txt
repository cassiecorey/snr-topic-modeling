Drought to impact on farm incomes
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) says farm incomes are predicted to fall this financial year because of the drought.
It says farm GDP is to drop by 16 per cent and agricultural exports are likely to fall 14 per cent.
The ABS figures are confirming what farmers are seeing in the paddock as their incomes are dropping, while the cost of their inputs are staying the same or rising if they are feeding expensive grain to animals.
Meanwhile peak farm groups in the eastern states have formed a Recovery Alliance to look at how the agriculture sector will rebuild after the drought.
The group will chase further funding from the Federal Government to help farmers buy seed, fertiliser and maintain core breeding stock.
New South Wales Farmers president Jock Laurie says the situation is dire for all rural communities, not just farmers.
"If we get into a situation where people out there actually reduce their cropping by half, then obviously that's the income halved for a lot of those small businesses," he said.
"In circumstances like these, what we're aiming to do is to try to make sure we get as much money flowing through agriculture, which then flows straight back in through those small communities - that will keep those small communities going, businesses going.
"The thing about this is that it's a way to help the whole regions, the whole communities, not just individual farmers."
