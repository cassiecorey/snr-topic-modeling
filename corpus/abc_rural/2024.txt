Tas company builds vineyard bio-protection mould
A Tasmanian company is developing a biological fungicide to control grey mould in vineyards.
Biocontrol Australia has won a Federal Government grant to commercialise the fungicide.
Dr Dean Metcalf says field trials have reduced the amount of grapes lost to the disease by 80 per cent.
He says the biological fungicide works with the help of a micro-organism that is native to Tasmania.
