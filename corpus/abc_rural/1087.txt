Rain boosts young cattle prices
Recent rain across parts of the eastern seaboard has helped to drive up cattle prices.
The Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, a benchmark of young cattle prices across saleyards in eastern Australia, jumped eight cents to 371 cents dressweight last night.
AgConcepts Analyst Angus Brown says a tight supply of cattle and increased demand from producers has prompted the increase, which is likely to continue.
"Low supply always forces prices up as lot feeders looking for cattle and processors looking for cattle and restockers are looking for something to put on the grass they are going to have in about a month," he said.
