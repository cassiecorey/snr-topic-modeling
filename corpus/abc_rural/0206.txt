Indonesian islands focus of rural development workshop
Agroforestry could be a major step towards food security across Nusa Tengarra Timur.
The islands, in eastern Indonesia, are the focus of an international rural development workshop in Kupang this week.
Small remote rural villages relying on subsistence agriculture providing for their daily food requirements have developed stands of mahogany, sandlewood, teak and cashews.
There are also small pockets of original forest vegetation within the broader tropical savannah grasslands.
But it has been agreed that non-timber forestry products such as honey, dyes, medicines and fruits could be further developed to generate income.
