NT campaign aimed at controlling brumby numbers
Authorities in the Northern Territory are developing an education campaign to try to control the number of wild horses on Aboriginal land.
It is estimated that up to 90,000 brumbies live in the Territory, and Parks and Wildlife has concerns about the environmental damage they are causing.
Senior wildlife ranger, Kym Schwartzkopff, says the horses have been allowed to run free and breed up.
"It is very hard to work with people out there that have got an affinity with an animal, so it's a kind of tread lightly area," he said.
