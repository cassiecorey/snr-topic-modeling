Graincorp to close 100 silos
Grain handling company Graincorp has confirmed it will close around 100 silos in the eastern states as part of a company restructure.
As the major grain handler for the eastern states, Graincorp currently maintains 320 silo sites but now plans to close almost a third.
Queensland will lose 23, Victoria 32, with 38 to go in New South Wales.
Workers at the silos were told about the closures yesterday, but were also told their jobs were safe.
Graincorp says the changes are in line with what growers want, which is better rates on rail services and a trend to using larger full-service silos.
Rodeo organisers in Tasmania say they will not call off a national titles competition this weekend despite vandals destroying an arena.
Only days ago the power box at the Harveydale Rodeo Arena was smashed to pieces and some time in the past 48 hours vandals entered the private property with wire cutters and shredded the perimeter fence.
Rodeo Tasmania claims the offenders were people driven to action by a high-profile campaign against rodeo's in recent times.
That campaign has been spearheaded by Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania, which says it had nothing with the vandalism but concedes their campaign may have spurred others into action.
"The public see what goes on at events they wouldn't normally go to but somebody out there may have been compelled to take direct action after they've seen disturbing footage that we've ween on television," spokeswoman Emma Haswell said.
