Cattle feedlot given green light
The New South Wales Government has approved a $60 million cattle feedlot at Moira Station near Mathoura in the southern Riverina.
The 160,000 head feedlot will be one of Australia's biggest and include a feed mill and hay processor.
The State Government has ordered the developers to start the feedlot operating at half capacity, with an independent audit required before production can be increased.
