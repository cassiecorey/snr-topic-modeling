US beef trade with S Korea on hold
US plans to resume its beef trade with South Korea are on hold over new concerns about American abattoirs.
Exports were to begin this week, but officials are concerned beef destined for South Korea will be processed in the same plants as beef from foreign animals, or cattle over 30 months of age.
Andrew Negline from Cargill Beef Australia says the delay will just create more uncertainty in the market.
"We know the US is coming back in, from Australia's point of view we need to see that re-entry rather than later to take the uncertainty out of the market," he said.
"Their buying habits have gone on hold if you like and you can imagine there's a lot of traffic between Korea and the US in anticipation of the market opening up from the US.
"There have also been a lot of offers out of the US well below the Australian market price."
