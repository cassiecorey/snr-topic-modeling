WA potato growers urged to pull their spuds early
Potato growers in Western Australia are being asked to pull their spuds before they have reached full yield production due to looming shortages.
A lack of processing potatoes in the eastern states due to drought and frosts earlier in this year has led to a surge in demand.
President of the WA Vegetable Growers Association Jim Turley says because growers have been asked to harvest earlier, they should be paid more.
"It is tight all round Australia. The growers are under pressure with their costs going up all the time," he said.
