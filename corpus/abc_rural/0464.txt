Bananas doing big business for NSW farmers
Banana growers on the north coast of New South Wales are continuing to harvest some spectacular profits in the wake of cyclone Larry.
Mullumbimby wholesaler Jan Trueman says cartons of fruit that fetched about $10 to $12 before the devastation of the Queensland industry, are now worth between $60 and $80.
He says it is set to become even more lucrative as winter approaches.
"Oh most definitely, for sure," he said.
"Our fruit is, y'know, is at a premium now and going into winter, I mean our fruit starts to slow up anyway, so it's only going to get dearer and dearer.
