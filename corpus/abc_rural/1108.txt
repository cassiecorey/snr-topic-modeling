Top End water region to be mapped
The last major unstudied water region of the Northern Territory's Top End is about to be mapped and modelled.
The Gulf region extends from Mataranka to the Gulf of Carpentaria and has a number of large, permanently running rivers.
Over the next three years the Territory Government will uncover not only how the aquifers and rivers interact, but also measure how much water the environment uses.
Project officer Ursula Zarr says they need to know how much water there is so they can protect everyone's interests.
