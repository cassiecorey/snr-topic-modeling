Native vegetation regulations costing graziers
A new report says native vegetation regulations in Queensland are costing some graziers up to a million dollars each in lost development.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) says the regulations have cost the rural sector about $520 million all up, with southern and western areas hardest hit.
ABARE's Lisa Elliston says graziers can not increase the carrying capacity of their properties and the findings suggest land clearing laws should be more flexible.
"What we mean by increased flexibility is the possibility of exploring for example things like tradeable development rights - that might require exploration of whether or not we can conserve or allow agricultural development to occur in one area if there's increased native vegetation conservation in another area," she said.
