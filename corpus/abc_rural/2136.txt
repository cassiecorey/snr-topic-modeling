Farmers may look to cooperatives for protection
Agricultural cooperatives could be about to make a comeback, according to new research.
Author Gary Lewis has been looking at farm cooperatives in Australia and says by allowing many to be corporatised, farmers have lost an important weapon.
He says farmers need to look after their own interests when it comes to drought, water and politics, and forming new cooperatives is one way of doing that.
