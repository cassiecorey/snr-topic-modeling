Court date set for AWI case
A trial date has finally been set for Australian Wool Innovation's (AWI) long-running case against the animal rights group, PETA.
The Federal Court will hear the case over two months from October next year.
Legal action was launched against PETA in 2004 after it mounted an international campaign to boycott Australian wool, over the practice of mulesing and live exports.
Les Targ from AWI says the peak body plans to call more than 30 witnesses.
"I won't be specific about names but obviously we'll be talking people who are experts in the area of fly control and experts in the geographic regions, and the effect of flies in those regions, so we'll be calling on a range of experts," he said.
