Fire and factory closure leaves 100 jobless
Almost 100 jobs will be lost with the closure of a fibre board factory in Tasmania's north.
Carter Holt Harvey has announced it will shut down its Bell Bay plant, which produces the building product MDF.
Operations there were suspended a month ago after a multi-million dollar fire.
Andrew Eastick from Northern Tasmanian Development says it was a difficult decision.
"The plant has always been marginal and one of the difficulties for the plant is the market for MDF has moved on, it produces a material which is only able to be manufactured down to a certain thickness," Mr Eastick said.
"Is the plant able to be re-engineered so that it can produce an MDF material that can attract a premium?
