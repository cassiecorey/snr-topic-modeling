Website to track drought impact
The Federal Government has unveiled its plan to make it easier for farmers to apply for drought relief.
The national agricultural monitoring system is a website which will track how major agricultural regions are performing.
While state governments could take weeks or months to collate drought information under the old application process, John Sims from the Bureau of Rural Sciences says the new system will take minutes.
"There's information on rainfall, there's information on how that rainfall affects pasture and crop growth, and how that translates into impact on say farm financial performance over the last couple of years," he said.
