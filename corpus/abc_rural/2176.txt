Legislation blocks grasslands clearing
After three years of wrangling, Tasmania has passed legislation to protect remnant grasslands from land clearing.
The controversial legislation was only passed yesterday in Tasmania's Upper House after a number of modifications were made to the Bill.
Tasmania was obliged under a federal agreement signed in 2003 to protect non-forest native vegetation.
President of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Roger Swain, says the legislation is restrictive but at least provides certainty.
