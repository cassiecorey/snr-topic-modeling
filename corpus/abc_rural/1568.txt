Whey extract to help cancer patients
A South Australian company has developed a method of using milk to relieve the side-effects of cancer treatment.
An extract from whey, a by-product of cheese-making, has been identified as a potential mouthwash treatment for mouth ulcers which affect around 40 per cent of cancer patients.
Dr Leanna Read from Adelaide-based TGR BioSciences says the product is close to being available for cancer patients.
"We've just entered what's called a phase two clinical trial and that's an important clinical trial which actually will we hope give us definitive evidence that this material really does work," she said.
"We may not require any further clinical trials after that to take it to market.
