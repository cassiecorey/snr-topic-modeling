Record-busting market growth expected to continue
Analysts are predicting the Australian sharemarket will continue its record growth, after it broke the 5,000 benchmark yesterday, for the first time since listing in 1987.
Hartley's director John Featherby, says the strength of the Australian mining and energy sector bodes well for the year's trading.
"Well if you measure it by the All Ordinaries index, it's going to be pushing close to 5,500 by the end of the calendar year, in my opinion," he said.
