Feedlot demand outstrips grain production
Queensland feedlot owners are being told they may have to buy grain to feed cattle from Western Australia, if local production does not increase.
The Department of Primary Industries says demand for feed grains like barley, sorghum and wheat is expected to outstrip local supplies five out of every 10 years.
Kym McIntyre says feedlots already consume about 2 million tonnes of grain a year, with a further 1 million tonnes likely to be needed over the next five years.
