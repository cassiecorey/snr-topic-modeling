Woolly cattle open small opportunity for hobby farmers
Two cattle producers in New South Wales are trying to downsize their cattle to produce a miniature breed which can also be shorn like a sheep.
Brendan and Yolana Haverfield breed Galloway cows on their hobby farm near Sutton in the southern highlands.
The cows are between 100 and 120 centimetres high, and apart from being extremely docile, the couple say their hair is like cashmere wool.
"It's a Scottish breed, from the Galloway area of Scotland, good for beef, they can be milked, also their hair can be spun like wool.
