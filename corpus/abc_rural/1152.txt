AWB restructure not enough, says US lobby group
America's peak grains lobby group claims a major restructure announced by wheat exporter AWB is just for show.
AWB has announced a multi-million dollar plan to separate its export arm AWB International from its corporate division.
As part of a push for better corporate governance, AWB International will continue to manage the single desk for wheat exports, but have its own management team and board.
Rebecca Coleman from US Wheat Associates says it still wants the AWB's monopoly on exports removed.
"US wheat does not think that it is going to make a difference, we think that it's just another show game and a shifting of boxes," she said.
"US Wheat's concerns has always been the power of the monopoly board, the way that they function in distorting trade and so a shifting of boxes around doesn't change the monopoly structure."
Australia's peak body, the Grains Council, will not comment on AWB's restructure plan.
In the wake of yesterday's announcement, AWB shares fell by 33 cents but recovered to finish at $3.85, just five cents below the opening price.
There has been little movement on the company's share price today, and Austock Agribusiness analyst Paul Jensz says the market has reacted positively.
"With this restructuring I think investors probably look at it as a first small step of a long road of recovery," he said.
"Investors broadly are saying that this level around $3.50-$3.90 is the bottom of AWB at this point."
