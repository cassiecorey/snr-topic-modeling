NSW to increase renewable energy targets
More wind farms are expected to be built in New South Wales after the State Government's decision to increase targets for renewable energy.
Ten per cent of all energy will need to be from renewable sources by 2010 and up to 15 per cent by 2020.
Already a new $220 million wind farm has been announced for Tarago in the state's south, while another development is tipped for Woodlawn, near Goulburn.
State Planning Minister Frank Sartor says more projects will follow.
"There's going to be opportunities for wind farms, for solar, biogas, a bit more hydro in some niche schemes in the state," he said.
