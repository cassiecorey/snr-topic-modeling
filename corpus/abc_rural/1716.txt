NT mango growers seek alternative transport methods
Despite the Top End's heat and humidity, some growers are considering sending mangoes to market without refrigeration.
A shortage of refrigeration trucks means growers might have to consider sending fruit south overnight when temperatures are cooler.
The Horticultural Association's Tracey Leo says it is high risk and will only be used as a last resort.
"We have predicted a shortfall of about 125 vans in the peaks of the season, when melons and mangoes are coming in, in their peak," she said.
"You know the trees are coming into higher production, we are going to be looking at higher volumes and the availability of refrigerated trucks in the Territory is always going to be an issue. So any transport methods that we can look into are good."
