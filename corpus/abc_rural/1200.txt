More men call depression hotline
A national hotline to help men in rural areas cope with depression has received 500 calls in its first month.
Chairman of beyondblue Jeff Kennett says 40 per cent of callers have been men, up from just 5 per cent.
Mr Kennett says being able to receive help anonymously from even the most remote areas seems to be making a difference.
"Unfortunately, depression is very prevalent throughout rural Australia and particularly among young men," he said.
"So what we hope with this beyondblue information line is to give men the capacity, wherever and however isolated their environment may be, for the price of a local call to seek direction and help as to what to do in overcoming their depressive illness."
