Senate told Govt to blame for 'environmental disaster' in Culgoa
A Senate inquiry into water has been told that successive Queensland governments have ignored the advice of expert scientists, to create what is possibly the 'worst environmental disaster in inland Australia' on the Culgoa Balonne floodplain in northern New South Wales.
NSW farmer Ed Fessey told the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs Committee that over extraction of water in Queensland is destroying both the environment and the livelihoods of those on the Culgoa floodplain.
"This is highlighted by the flippant, nonchalant and at times dismissive attitude that successive Queensland Natural Resources to due process; the complete ignorance of a very strong and detailed submission by the New South Wales Government in 2004; the very select use of Peter Cullen's scientific report to endorse their plan, whilst ignoring the clear warnings that significant ecological problems will occur," he said.
