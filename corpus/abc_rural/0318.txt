Tweed farmer picks up environmental award
A sugar cane farmer from northern New South Wales has been named Australia's best environmentally friendly farmer.
Robert Quirk received the 16th McKell Medal for excellence in natural resource management at a ceremony in Sydney this morning.
A farmer in the Tweed Valley for 44 years, Mr Quirk says he is dedicated to improving soils, reducing chemical use and fertiliser run-off while increasing productivity and profitability.
"It is possible to do environmental stewardship, increase your bottom line and have better outcomes all round for both the environment, the farming community and the longevity of the sugar industry, and other industries," he said.
