'Negative propaganda' behind forestry skills shortage
A Federal Government audit has accused the Greens and some mainstream media of peddling negative propaganda, which is exacerbating skills shortages in the timber industry.
The report details future construction projects worth $4 billion in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia.
But it says industry will struggle to find the 4,500 people needed to build them.
Forestry Minister Eric Abetz says while the audit was completed by government authorities, it is independent.
Senator Abetz says it backs up his own anecdotal evidence showing young people are being turned off.
"You talk to the forestry schools around Australia and they will tell you that students feel it is difficult to enrol in forestry whilst they would like to, because of the pressure from green groups," he said.
