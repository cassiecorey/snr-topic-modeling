Snowy Hydro rethinks development plans
Snowy Hydro says it will be forced to borrow heavily, now that its planned privatisation has been scrapped but staff jobs are safe.
The Federal Government scuttled plans to sell the power generator earlier this month.
Managing director Terry Charlton says the sale would have given Snowy Hydro access to extra funds but the company now must rethink its development plans.
"We're looking at increasing our borrowings, cutting back on capital expenditure, cutting back on other expenditures, hopefully being able to defer some expenditure on the scheme and substitute it with other growth opportunities," he said.
