Monopoly questioned amid AWB probe extension
The oil-for-food inquiry has been given another two months to deliver its final report.
Federal Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock has extended the inquiry into AWB's deals with Iraq until November 24.
As a result, the Western Australian Pastoralists and Graziers Association says the Federal Government should make changes to legislation now to allow other companies to export grain.
Spokesman Leon Bradley says the delay leaves growers, who are moving into harvest, feeling insecure about their wheat returns from AWB.
"It leaves growers in a very difficult position for the forthcoming harvest because we actually need legislative clarity because we deliver our grain," he said.
