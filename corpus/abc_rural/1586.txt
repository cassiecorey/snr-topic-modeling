Summerfruit slashes board numbers
The peak research, development and marketing body for summer fruit growers will cut the size of its board from 21 to 11.
The move by Summerfruit Australia is an attempt to cut costs.
Chairman Ian McAllister says the organisation's finances are low because grower levies have not increased since 1997.
