Drought may affect dairy foods supply, exporter says
A Victorian-based exporter and processor of dairy foods has told a conference in Sydney that Japan is concerned about Australia's capacity to ensure long-term supply because of the drought.
Burra Foods says Australia exports nearly $23 billion of food and beverages a year, with Japan taking 20 per cent of that.
But chief executive Grant Crothers says while Japan has been a loyal customer of Australia for two decades, it is now worried about the continuing dry conditions.
"Security of supply for any country that can't feed themselves is a big issue and their self-sufficiency on food is down to about 40 per cent and they know they need to buy food outside Japan," he said.
