Wine grape ethanol trial under way
A 12-month trial producing ethanol from wine grapes has begun in South Australia.
Tarac Technologies in the Barossa Valley currently distills alcohol from winery waste.
The company will supply South Australian Farmers Fuel with 100,000 litres of biofuel over the next 12 months.
Spokesman Chris Zajac says it remains to be seen if the process can be economically viable.
"The reason we've decided to run the trial is to basically see how it performs against other ethanols in the marketplace," he said.
