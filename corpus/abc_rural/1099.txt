Grower challenges importers to buy Aust coffee beans
An organic coffee producer from New South Wales is challenging Australia's three main coffee importers to buy locally grown beans.
Australians drink nearly 50,000 tonnes of coffee a year and almost all of it is imported.
Organic grower Cath Ford says the industry has to demonstrate the quality of local coffee to consumers and coffee suppliers.
"Quite frankly people will buy commodity fair trade coffee over Australian coffee if we can not get across that the quality and flavour is different," she said.
"We need to get on our bandwagon and show that what we have is a supreme product over other people's."
