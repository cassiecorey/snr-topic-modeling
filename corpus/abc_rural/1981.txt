Canadian GM canola may be in Aust by year's end
Genetically-modified (GM) canola from Canada could be imported into Australia by the end of the year.
It is one of 40 applications to import grain and oilseeds to address feed shortages.
Peter Liehne from the Australian Quarantine Service has told the Senate Estimates Agriculture Committee that if the canola application succeeds, the oilseed will have to be crushed near the port of entry.
He says the applicant plans to make the remaining meal into livestock feed.
