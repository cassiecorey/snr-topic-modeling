Tuckey's AWB plan creates further uncertainty for growers: Joyce
Liberal MP Wilson Tuckey is under fire for planning to ask Parliament to vote on removing AWB's veto powers over wheat exports.
National Senator Barnaby Joyce says Mr Tuckey's plans for a private member's Bill creates further uncertainty for growers.
Mr Tuckey wants the veto removed so WA grain growers can sell their wheat to another exporter for a higher price.
But Senator Joyce says the enemies of Australia's single desk for wheat exports in the US and Europe will seize on any disunity within the Federal Government.
