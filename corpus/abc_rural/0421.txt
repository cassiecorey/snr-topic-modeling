Beef Australia under way in Rockhampton
Australia's biggest beef industry event is under way in central Queensland.
Rockhampton hosts Beef Australia every three years, claiming it is the country's beef capital.
Fifty thousand people are in the city and over 200 head of stud cattle from 34 breeds, making it one of the largest displays in one place in one time in the world.
And the world is in Rockhampton - 450 delegates from 27 countries including Argentina, Indonesia and China.
It is not all conferences and seminars though. The Iron Man and Woman event will see competitors eat marinated bulls testicles and there's a great debate, is beef better than sex?
