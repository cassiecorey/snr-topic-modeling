Farmers urged to talk about problems
Drought-affected farmers are being told to swallow their pride and ask for help to get through this season.
Victorian rural outreach worker Ivan Lister says more farmers are seeking support than during the 2002 drought.
He says in many cases talking about problems can help.
"The word that we use is stay connected and we try to promote that amongst all the communities," he said.
"They'll either be talking to each other in family situations, talking to the neighbour, asking each other how they're going.
"Be aware that a lot of people are suffering at this time and will continue to struggle.
