Water Initiative has room for improvement: report
The first stage of a national assessment of Australia's water resources has found there is considerable room for improvement.
The Australian Water Resources 2005 report is a baseline assessment of Australia's national water resources conducted by national independent agencies including the CSIRO.
It is designed to show how the National Water Initiative, a blueprint for the country's water reform, is influencing Australia's water resources.
It reveals there is considerable room for improvement and says the state and federal governments need to take firm action to put in place effective water planning to protect river systems and to agree on a national standard for sustainable yields of surface and ground water systems.
