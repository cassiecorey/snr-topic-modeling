Woolgrowers back AWI directors
Woolgrowers have shown support for the direction of their peak body, voting to retain the current board directors of Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
Growers have also voted to keep a wool tax of 2 per cent to fund AWI's marketing and research.
Five candidates had nominated for the three available positions on the board, and AWI chairman Ian McLachlan is happy that growers have backed the status quo.
"The board's doing the best it can," he said.
"I don't want to get into a discussion about about people who didn't get onto the board and so forth, all I'd say is that I would like to see these elections conducted in a, for want of a better term, in a gentlemanly fashion, because this industry is far too important to have individuals badmouthed not only at election time but through the whole year, so in the future I would just hope we would march on together because there's some prosperity out there if we get it right," he said.
