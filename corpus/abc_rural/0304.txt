Lack of skilled workers limiting new water projects
Attempts to fix Australia's water shortage problems are suffering because a scarcity of skilled workers.
Delegates at a National Water Conference in Alice Springs have heard that a lack of qualified experts is limiting the development of new water saving projects.
Chief executive of the Australian Water Association Chris Davis says the most severe shortages are in the science and engineering field.
"Most organisations tend to be populated by middle-aged men who are about to retire in a year or two's time so we're staring down the barrel of an even worse shortage in a couple of years from now," he said.
