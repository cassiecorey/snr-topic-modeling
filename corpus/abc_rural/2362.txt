Govt expected to change forestry investment rules
The Federal Government is expected to make changes to the investment rules for Managed Investment Schemes (MIS) for plantation forestry.
It is believed the Government will not remove tax advantages for investors, but instead regulate how much invested money is spent on planting trees.
Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan says he would not object to the changes because Australia needs more trees for environmental reasons.
But he wants the laws changed for schemes for annual crops, like wine, tomatoes, olives and wheat.
