Authorities inspect commercial banana farms
Authorities are inspecting commercial banana farms in northern New South Wales today after the discovery of the disease 'bunchy top' north of Lismore.
The disease has not been seen in the Richmond Valley since it was eradicated in the 1970s.
A commercial grower found the disease on his farm last week.
