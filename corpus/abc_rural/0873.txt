Wild pigs may be spreading sugar cane disease, says farmer
Sugar cane smut has now been confirmed on more than 20 farms in south-east Queensland.
The fungal disease was discovered for the first time in Queensland two weeks ago and the industry's exotic disease plant health plan is in force.
While there are now strict quarantine measures on the movement of people and plants, cane farmer Bruce Royan says wild pigs may be spreading the disease.
"It's obviously blown in with the wind or somebody else has been driving around the farm," he said.
