Single desk challenge
AWB has challenged the growing number of proposals calling for changes to the single desk export system.
National wheat pool manager David Johnston has told a public debate in Victoria that AWB will accept the outcome from the oil-for-food inquiry.
But he says if AWB's export monopoly or its veto over grain export applications is removed, wheat growers will be the losers.
"The bulk veto, I think, is a core component of the single desk as we know it and if we have people wanting to send wheat into Indonesia or Malaysia or any of our core markets you'll have Australian wheat competing with Australian wheat," he said.
