Mango growers comfortable with imports decision
The mango industry says it is not concerned by a decision to allow imports from Taiwan into Australia.
Biosecurity Australia has approved an application to import mangoes under strict regulations, including vapour heat treatment of the fruit before they leave Taiwan.
Trevor Dunmall, from the Australian Mango Industry Association, says there will only be a narrow window for the fruit to compete with the homegrown product.
"The Taiwanese season's basically counter-seasonal to the Australian season although there could be some overlap in their season with our early season mangoes," he said.
