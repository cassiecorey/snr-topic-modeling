Farmers warned to watch out for food mile phenomenon
Australian farmers have been warned to take note of a new consumer trend in the United Kingdom.
Companies who import Australian beef into Britain and the European Union are wary of the new phrase 'food miles' which could be used to limit imports into that country.
Food miles refers to the growing practice of importers and supermarket chains stacking their shelves with exotic items from around the world.
The criticism is they are chewing through too much aircraft and truck fuel in getting them there, thereby increasing carbon emissions.
Retail manager from Global, UK's biggest meat importer and also an importer of Australian beef, Bob Rose, says we need to keep an eye on the food mile phenomenon.
"In the UK at the moment, global warming is a very big issue," Mr Rose said.
"And one of the issues that has raised its head is bringing product from around the world, and the costs of the carbon emissions to the environment of bringing that product from around the world; would it not bet better sourcing locally-produced product?
