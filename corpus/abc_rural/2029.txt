Giant Qld dam falls to record low
One of Queensland's largest dams has now fallen to its lowest level yet.
Fairbairn Dam at Emerald supplies 200,000 megalitres of water each year for irrigation, industrial and urban needs.
When full the dam holds 1.3 million megalitres, but today it is at just 14 per cent of capacity.
Nev Wogand from Sunwater says it would take an exceptional wet season to fill the dam.
