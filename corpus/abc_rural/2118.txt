SA ban on GM crops extended
A moratorium on genetically-modified crops (GM) in South Australia has been extended to 2008.
The Upper House of the State Parliament passed the extension Bill last night after motions by the Greens and Democrats to extend the ban to 2009 were defeated.
The decision brings SA into line with the crop bans in Victoria and New South Wales.
SA Democrats leader Sandra Kanck believes the drought is being used to push the introduction of drought-tolerant GM crops but says the technology is not yet ready.
"The lobbyists for GM foods and GM crops are very, very effective and there is this desire that's held out to people that you could make more money," she said.
