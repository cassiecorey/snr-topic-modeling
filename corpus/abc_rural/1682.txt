Milk company to draw up shortlist of buyers
A merger or takeover has not been ruled out for one of Australia's main milk companies.
Tatura Milk, which controls around 5 per cent of Australia's supply, is undergoing a financial review after posting a $6 million pre-tax loss last year.
Supplier meetings were held this week in Victoria's Goulburn Valley to explain options put forward by several parties interested in Tatura.
Company chairman Ian Bertram says a shortlist will be drawn up before any decisions are made about mergers or funding help.
"At this stage we can't confirm who they are, but we are negotiating with 10 to 12 interested parties," he said.
