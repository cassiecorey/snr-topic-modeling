Online shopping takes off as petrol prices remain high
High retail and petrol prices are believed to have contributed to a big jump in Internet shopping in regional Australia.
ACNeilsen figures show shopping has increased by 20 per cent in the last year alone, with almost 1.5 million country people connected to the web.
Western Queensland online shopper Janet Powne says it is more about convenience.
She lives in Bollon, which is 500 kilometres from the nearest major shopping centre.
"I just started out by mainly shopping for gifts - because we don't have a selection of gift stores that I can readily get to, I started investigating what's online and one Christmas I bought all my gifts online," she said.
