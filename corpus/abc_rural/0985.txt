Grain production forecasts down
Strong global wheat prices are the only bright spot for growers at the moment, with production forecasts down right around the country.
Queensland has all but given up on its winter wheat, it is a similar case in WA, while New South Wales and Victoria are doing it tough, with weeds the latest threat to young crops.
It is a gloomy picture right around the country, with South Australia the only state expected to deliver a reasonable harvest.
But grains analyst Lloyd George says with international stocks expected to tighten, good prices should continue.
