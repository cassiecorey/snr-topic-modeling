Childers farm tested for cane smut
There are fears that an exotic disease discovered on a sugarcane farm in south-east Queensland could be the devastating cane smut.
Queensland's Department of Primary Industries has quarantined a property near Childers after suspect plants were discovered late last week.
Cane smut, which can stunt growth and cause production losses of between 20 and 30 per cent, is considered the highest exotic disease risk for sugarcane in Australia.
While the Canegrowers Organisation says the disease has not been confirmed, general manager Ian Ballantyne says the industry is prepared.
"Canegrowers are members of a thing called Plant Health Australia and through Plant Health Australia we bring together BSES, state and federal governments, ourselves, and other parties who are interested and have an affect on disease incursion," he said.
"We've learnt a lot I think over the years from citrus canker and things like the popia fruit fly and now we think it's better to overreact early than under-react."
