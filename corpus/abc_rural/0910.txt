Mail contractor finally quits 400km mail run
It is a bittersweet day for one outback mail contractor,
After almost 40 years of servicing properties in south-west Queensland, Cecil Russell is retiring
Since 1968 Mr Russell has been making the 400 kilometres round trip from Augathella to Carnarvon Station twice a week and says the scenery is the best part of the job.
"I love the country up there and that's probably why I've been doing it so long, it's a for ever changing sort of thing, seasons change and yes there's a lot of wildflowers at times," he said.
"Every day you get to see a different mob of brumby horses, see quite a few wild dogs and I enjoy just looking at the cattle as I go and that sort of thing.
