Council seeks funding for annual stored grain survey
The Grains Council of Australia says an annual survey of stored grain is needed to stop livestock farmers panic-buying overseas during droughts.
It wants both federal government research bodies, like the Grains Research and Development Corporation and the livestock industry, to pay $50,000 a year for the survey.
Grains Council chairman Murray Jones says livestock farmers need to be made aware that domestic grain is still cheaper than imported grain.
"[The] Grains Council of Australia supports the livestock industry who've been asking for an indication of a clearer picture of the availability of grain stocks," he said.
"I think it's important, both from the livestock industry and from farmers as well, that we have some some record of the greater transparency of the grain at hand."
Meanwhile the worsening dry in southern and central New South Wales will lead to job losses at Graincorp.
The largest east coast grain handler believes it will only open two thirds of its silos and dramatically cut its casual staff.
Graincorp's central regional manager Murray Wilkinson says the company does not have an option but to reduce its costs as the crop dwindles by the day.
