Weather takes its toll on farmers
Drought is worsening across south-eastern Australia.
In the New South Wales Murray Valley region, 650 irrigators are now eligible for exceptional circumstance assistance until next January.
In Victoria's north-east, several farmers are shooting sheep, or selling stock below market prices.
Director of Hume Corridor Community Health, Wayne Weaire, is organising community barbeques in the region to support farmers:
"In the last drought we found that people if they became isolated from each other, if they simply worked hard on farm or simply sat around wondering what they could do there were enormous amounts of stress," he said.
"It just has an impact on the whole sense of well being on the family or the individual and we found last time the greatest lesson was how important it is to get out there and talk and get access to information and support from each other and from other agencies."
And cold weather is a problem too.
Citrus growers in the Murray Valley and the Riverland are keeping an eye out for frost damage.
Industry experts claim that damage occurs if the temperature drops below -2 overnight for longer than four hours and that has already happened several times this winter.
Some growers fear a repeat of 1982 when young trees died because of the extreme weather.
Horticulturalist Steven Falivene says growers need to keep in contact with their citrus packer if they believe their fruit has been damaged by frost.
"The real damage happens at say two weeks afterwards," he said.
