Frost hits Tas orchards
Tasmania's fruit growers are bracing for heavy losses after frosts hit orchards around the State overnight.
The full extent of the damage will not be known until later in the week, but early reports suggest severe losses of cherries, apricots and apples.
Steve Wilson from the University of Tasmania says orchardists in the State's south have been hit hardest.
"Most growers won't be aware of whether they've suffered any damage until probably late this afternoon or in the next couple of days," he said.
