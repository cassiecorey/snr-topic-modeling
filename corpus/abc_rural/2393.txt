Turf grass producer bites the dust
Tightening water restrictions in many parts of Australia are taking their toll on the turf-laying industry.
The industry has lost $15 million this year, as home owners become reluctant to lay grass they cannot water.
Ray Moir from Turf Producers Australia says South Australia has been hardest hit by the drought.
"It's having varying effects from state to state," he said.
