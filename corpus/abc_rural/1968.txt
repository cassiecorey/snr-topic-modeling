Canola crushers look to import crop
The canola crop has now all but failed this season in New South Wales.
Canola crushers are currently looking at importing canola from Western Australia or Canada to meet the state's domestic demand.
Pete MacSmith from Macsmith Milling in the state's central west says the local figures are not good.
"The latest estimates are putting the NSW crop at somewhere between 25 and 35,000 tonnes," he said.
"There's been a few reasonable crops up in the north.
"There will be very little harvested in the central west until we get down to the irrigation areas.
