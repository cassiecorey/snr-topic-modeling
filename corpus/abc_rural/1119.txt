Draft timber harvesting regulations anger landowners
Landowners in New South Wales are angry at the State Government's draft regulations for timber harvesting in privately-owned forests.
The result of years of debate, the code of practice aims to protect rare timber species, and wildlife and biodiversity, on farms.
But it does not include compensation for landowners.
Robert Dyason, a tree grower in the state's north, believes the draft code is a missed opportunity.
"We could have been presented with a complete package of code, education and compensation for reserved areas, it would have promoted adaptive management with provision for improvement in management as knowledge improved," Mr Dyason said.
