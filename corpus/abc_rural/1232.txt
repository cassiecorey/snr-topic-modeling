Diggers and Dealers conference kicks off in Kalgoorlie
Fifteen hundred miners have travelled from all over the globe to attend the annual Diggers and Dealers talkfest at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.
The gold mining town is packed to capacity with some of the world leaders in the resource sector, with many delegates having to resort to camper vans and caravan sites for accommodation.
However, talk of moving the conference to a capital city is not being considered by chairman Brian Hurley.
"If it was in Perth or Melbourne or Sydney it would just be another conference," he said.
