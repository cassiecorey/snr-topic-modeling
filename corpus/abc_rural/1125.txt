Black truffles yields 'fantastic'
The black truffle industry is enjoying its best ever season.
Low yields have plagued growers in recent years but Tim Terry from Tasmanian Truffle Enterprises says his harvest has tripled this season and it is a similar story around Australia.
"There are certainly some very good yields on the mainland and in Western Australia there have been some fantastic yields of much older plantations of course," Mr Terry said.
