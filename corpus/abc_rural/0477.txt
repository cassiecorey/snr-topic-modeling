Budget fails to tackle climate change, green groups say
The Federal Government has come under fire from green groups, which claim the Budget fails to tackle climate change.
The major allocation in environmental spending is $500 million for the Murray Darling Basin Commission.
That money will fund projects like salt interception schemes, fishways, local and weir upgrades, and possibly buying water from farmers.
South Australian River Murray Minister Karlene Maywald says the money has been desperately needed.
"Projects were underfunded, the Murray Darling Basin Commission was underfunded, our projects that we all agreed to from a jurisdictional point of view were all starting to slip and it looked like we were never going to achieve what we needed to do to save the River Murray," she said.
