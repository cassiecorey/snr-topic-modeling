TV station operator pushes for rural channel
The operators of a rural community television station say the Federal Government is ignoring requests for a new digital TV station dedicated to rural Australia.
South Australian-based BushVision says in a national survey of 250 people, more than 90 per cent believed rural issues were not covered adequately by mainstream TV networks and almost all supported a dedicated rural channel.
The Federal Government wants digital technology to replace the current analogue network within six years.
BushVision station manager Leon Ashby there is good reasons for a rural channel.
"For many years, our information and our news has either been sensationalised and it puts a picture of rural Australians always whingeing, always got a flood or a fire, or some catastrophe," he said.
"But it doesn't give the overall picture that there's a lot of good things happening.
"We talked about better communications for the bush but television has been left completely out of the picture."
