McGauran leans toward voluntary horticulture code
There are growing signs the horticulture industry will have to be satisfied with a voluntary code of conduct.
The Federal Government originally pledged a mandatory code to give fruit and vegetable producers more negotiating power in the market place.
But Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says a voluntary code is now being given serious consideration, although no final decision has been made.
"One thing we want to avoid by way of a mandatory code is polarisation of the industry," he said.
"You need the whole of supply chain in horticulture working together as we face the pressure of cheap imports and a voluntary code of conduct may very well serve to bring industry closer together for mutual benefit.
