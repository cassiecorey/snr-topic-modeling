Controls on explosive chemicals sales to be tightened
The Queensland Government is further tightening controls on the sale of explosive chemicals after the arrest of a Brisbane man found to be in the possession of 53 kilograms of explosives.
The Government will meet with farm and mining groups in Brisbane today to discuss the implications of the new controls.
Police allege a Brisbane high school teacher illegally purchased the explosive Powergel from chemical company Orica under the pretense of using it for movie stunts.
The 40-year-old is expected to be the first Queenslander charged with terrorism.
The Queensland Government has announced sellers of chemicals, like ammonium nitrate used by farmers, will need to report fortnightly to the Government on who they sell explosive materials to and even call the Department of Natural Resources to double-check the details of new and existing customers.
