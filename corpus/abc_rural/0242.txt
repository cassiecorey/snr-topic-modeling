Yellow leaf curl virus outbreak hits tomato growing region
There has been a confirmed outbreak of the tomato yellow leaf curl virus in one of Australia's major tomato growing regions.
Plant biosecurity officers are in Bundaberg in south-east Queensland to increase surveillance and identify the spread of the virus, discovered in a backyard garden.
The disease was only recently detected in Australia, near Brisbane and can stunt plant growth and slash production.
Hydroponic grower David Da Tra says growers need to keep the virus carrier at bay.
"Just hoping we can control or minimise the vector which is the silverleaf greenhouse," he said.
