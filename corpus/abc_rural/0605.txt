Grim winter rain outlook for eastern Australia
Despite previous forecasts, eastern Australia now looks set to receive below average rainfall this winter.
The latest outlook from the National Climate Centre says most of Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland can expect a drier than average year, while Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory can expect close to average rains.
Climatologist Blair Trewin says regions still struggling with drought are the least likely to see big winter rains.
"The outlook for northern New South Wales and southern Queensland is a rather dry one," he said.
"In most of that region we are saying the chances of above average rainfall are only 35 to 40 per cent so about a 60 to 65 per cent chance of coming in below normal.
