Fruit fly find concerns growers
Fruit and vegetable producers on the Adelaide Plains are worried about the impact of a fruit fly outbreak.
Mediterranean fruit fly, which also targets vegetables, has been detected in Adelaide's north-west suburbs.
Mike Redmond, from the Virginia Horticulture Centre, north of the outbreak, says a quarantine area has been established and sterile flies are being released to contain the spread.
"If it got into our greenhouses it would be horrific for our industry," Mr Redmond said.
"Tomatoes, capsicums, eggplants would be the main impacts from our perspective.
