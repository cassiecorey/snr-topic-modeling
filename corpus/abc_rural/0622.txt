Station sale to allow for expansion
The head of Heytesbury says the sale of two of its cattle stations will allow for more strategic investment into its existing live export cattle and wine businesses.
Heytesbury announced the $97 million sale of Anthony Lagoon and Eva Downs Stations in the Northern Territory to Australia's biggest beef producer, Australian Agricultural Company, on Friday.
Chairman Janet Holmes a Court says while there are no immediate plans to purchase other stations, the company might look to consolidate some of its operations.
"It gives us the opportunity also to maybe expand our wine operations or buy other properties that are closer to the VRDs and the Kimberley properties that we already have," she said.
