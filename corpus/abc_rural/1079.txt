Farmers welcome EC assistance extension
Farmers across four states have welcomed the Federal Government's decision to extend drought relief until next year.
Exceptional circumstances (EC) have been extended in 23 drought-declared areas in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
Under the scheme, farmers and pastoralists who are been battling drought receive income and business support.
Tiffany Lord, from Yudnapinna Station west of Port Augusta in South Australia, says it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the assistance.
"It's helped out keep us afloat, I'm sure that it's helping a lot of other people who are in the same predicament out this way," he said.
