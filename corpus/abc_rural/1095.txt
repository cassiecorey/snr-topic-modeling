Much needed rain falls on very dry regions
There is some hope for Western Australia's grain growers today after rain fell overnight in some very dry regions.
While it is too late for farmers in the large grain growing districts in the northern-mid-west, moderate to good falls further south will boost thirsty crops.
Weather bureau forecaster Noel Puzey says the really good news is that a more wintry weather pattern is setting in.
"There have been some reasonable falls to help people along at the moment, falls range from about six millimetres at Dalwallinu in the Central Wheatbelt to 20 millimetres through some parts of the Great Southern and it is still moving through to the east so mainly southern districts can pick up a few showers around the place," he said.
A group of Victorian farmers are developing a national grading system for biodiesel to assure its quality.
With more and more farmers blending their own fuel, the Central Wimmera Community Enterprise group says the system will quash concerns that biodiesel could damage engines.
Chairman Peter Neiwand says once an Australian biodiesel standard is in place, the Federal Government will be lobbied to reinstate tax breaks.
