Wine industry to solve its own oversupply problem
The wine industry says it will not ask the Federal Government for a financial bail out and will try to solve the grape glut itself.
Industry bodies, leading wine companies and federal and state governments are meeting in Melbourne today to try to find a way through the oversupply problems embattling the industry.
Stephen Strachan from the Winemakers Federation of Australia believes the sector can fix its own mess.
"I don't think there'll be any silver bullets and I don't think we'll come out this afternoon saying we've got a solution to get through this surplus next year, it's just not going to happen," he said.
