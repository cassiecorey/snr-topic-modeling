Cane smut found on 30 properties
Sugar cane smut has now been found on 30 farms in the Childers area of south-east Queensland.
The disease, which can cause major crop losses, was found for the first time on the east coast less than a month ago.
Chris Adriaanson, from Queensland's Department of Primary Industries, says the disease will not be eradicated.
He says in the future, farmers will have to rely on resistant crop varieties to eliminate the impact of the disease.
"It depends on what you define as eradication," he said.
"If eradicating means biologically extinguishing the disease, then that's never been the objective, it's not part of the way we have to do this business.
