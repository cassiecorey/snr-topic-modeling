Australia to lead climate change deal negotiations
Australia will lead negotiations on a new international climate change deal to replace the Kyoto protocol which is due to expire in 2012.
The framework, to be co-developed with Germany and South Africa, will apply to almost 200 countries.
Mick Keogh from the Australian Farm Institute says farmers have led the way in reducing greenhouse emissions and should not be further penalised.
He says federal and state governments cannot take credit for work largely undertaken by farmers.
"There is only one sector of the Australian economy that's made a very significant contribution to the reduction in the growth of Australia's greenhouse emissions and that is the farm sector," he said.
