WA export holding yards breaching standards: RSPCA
The RSPCA says most live export holding yards in Western Australia breach new national quarantine standards.
The animal welfare body is investigating what it says is a lack of shelter at one of the state's biggest ports at Wyndham.
It says cattle, goats and pigs are forced to stand in temperatures of more than 40 degrees for up to three days without shade.
Since the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) standards are not enforceable, the RSPCA wants the owner of the yards, the Ord River District Co-operative, to provide shelter.
But spokesman Jim Hughes says that is unlikely to happen.
Mr Hughes says the facilities are not part of their core business and they do not receive enough rent to warrant upgrading the 80-year-old yards.
"What we get for those cattle yards is no more than a donation," he said.
"In those circumstances why on earth would we want to spend a lot of money on facilities at the yard?"
The new AQIS export standards state registered premises must provide animals with protection from extreme climatic conditions.
But RSPCA prosecutor Robin Moore says he was told the standards are not enforceable.
