Vaile starts Budget sell
The Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Nationals, Mark Vaile, has been out this morning telling rural areas the Budget sets up the bush to take advantage of the current resources boom through big infrastructure spending.
He is especially proud, as most National party members are, of the $2.4 billion in roads funding he says the Nationals have helped secure.
"If you are talking about regional Australia, my view is one of the most important targeted components in this budget is that $307 million of extra money directed at local governments for local roads and bridges this year, they're the important things to regional Australia," he said.
When Australia's peak rural lobby group the National Farmers Federation says this is the best Budget in 11 years, that should not leave too much room for the Opposition to be critical.
But that has not stopped Labor's agriculture spokesman Gavan O'Connor describing the Budget as missed opportunities.
His point is you can have all the new bitumen in world but if it is not too dear to drive on that bitumen because of high fuel prices and higher interest rates, well the big spending backfires.
He is also talking up what he says is the Government's failure to target its infrastructure spending, failure to address environmental issues and failure to ease skills shortages in regional areas.
"No mention of the productivity challenge and no attempt to get on top of the foreign debt," he said.
"No attempt to address the massive skills crisis in rural Australia and there's no movement on the last great frontier for Australian agriculture that is the regeneration of our soils.
"There is no attempt to engineer through these expenditures a new wave of research and innovation in the rural sector.
"On that basis I think there will be some significant questions asked about this Budget."
