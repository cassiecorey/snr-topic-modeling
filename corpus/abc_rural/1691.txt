Dry weather forcing Indonesian cattle feedlots to cart water
The Islamic festival of Ramadan is under way and a prolonged dry in Indonesia is forcing some cattle feedlots to cart water.
Stored dam water is disappearing quickly for the largest importer of Australian cattle.
But Greg Pankhurst of Agrogiri Perkasa says at least the cattle fatten faster when it is not raining.
"Extremely dry, unbelievably dry. We have a wet and dry season like the Top End of Australia, but we have not had rain here now for two months, which is very unusual for the wet season," he said.
