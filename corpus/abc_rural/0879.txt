Rain brings relief to WA farmers
There has finally been some rain relief in Western Australia, with falls along the western coast overnight.
Only marginal falls were recorded inland, with some grain growers faring better than others.
"By 6:00pm last night I'd had 20.2 millimetres and then overnight another 7.5mls, so for those few hours it was 27.7 and it's absolutely fantastic," John Williams from Bindoon said.
"Just so great to see all this rain after all this time. Those that have been waiting for the rain will be able to put their crops in and those that have dry sown, this will help them along just great."
Garth Cowald from West Canna says he had 4.5 millimetres of rain last night.
"We haven't sown any wheat yet, getting a bit late now, the ground is too dry. We haven't had hardly any rain now for three months. We have sown lupins and oats but it hasn't come up," Mr Cowald said.
"So with the costs now days, I think it's better to leave the seed and fertiliser in the shed and the chemicals and just take it from there."
