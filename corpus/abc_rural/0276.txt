Poppy grower contracts slashed
Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline has slashed Tasmanian poppy grower contracts by 90 per cent.
Almost 500 poppy growers supply seed to the company with the lost contracts worth between $10 million and $12 million.
The company says there is a depression in world market prices and continuing oversupply.
Company researcher Dr Mike Doyle says the extraction plant will continue to run on existing stocks although the crop reduction will be for only one year.
