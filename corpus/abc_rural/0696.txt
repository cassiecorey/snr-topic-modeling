Qld leasehold agreement sealed
The Queensland Government and lobby group Agforce have after four years finally reached a new agreement for leasehold land, which is expected to provide more certainty for graziers.
Some conservation groups have argued that the maximum time for a lease should be 10 years.
Brett De Hayr from Agforce says the Government has agreed to 30, 40 and 50 year tenures.
"The frame work is basically 30 years for leases deemed to be in poor condition, 40 years for leases in good condition and the component that we think is actually most attractive in this is the ability for 50 year leases to be granted where people go over and above their duty of care," he said.
