Irrigators wary about Govt's water licence plans
The New South Wales Government plans to buy water licences off irrigators to help meet its target for environmental flows in the Murray and Snowy Rivers.
Until now the focus has been on finding water savings, but the Government has now called for tenders to sell water on a permanent basis.
Conservationists have welcomed the move but irrigators in inland New South Wales are wary.
General manager of Murray Irrigation George Warne is worried that if the Government buys the water it will push up prices or reduce access to water for irrigators.
"The State Government has moved straightaway from water savings and its now just fully trying to get into the water market," he said.
"The governments may have given up, I think they might be coming under some pressure to find the water savings and they've decided that a more direct approach works.
