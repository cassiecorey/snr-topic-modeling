Flooded market makes life tough for citrus growers
Citrus growers say their outlook is going from bad to worse.
Growers says a large crop, a flood of cheap imported juice concentrate and shrinking export markets are preventing many from selling their fruit.
The summer crop is being dumped in southern New South Wales, with growers angry at an offer of $80 a tonne for their fruit.
Frank Battistel from Riverina Citrus says he is not confident about the future.
"I know quite a few properties that have turned off water to their trees, they just can't continue to lose profit every year like that and they need to make a decision to either keep going and lose money or just get out of the industry."
But citrus growers in the west believe China could be their salvation.
It has taken more than five years for the Chinese to approve Australian fruit imports, which will largely come from the eastern states.
WA orchardist Mark Scott says that will mean less fruit sent west.
"We compete against imports from those states here in WA every day and so that the taking fruit out from their markets will mean less competition here in WA," Mr Scott said.
