Rare butterfly found in Arnhem Land
A rare and endangered butterfly in north-east Arnhem Land is now a bit safer.
The gove crow butterfly was previously thought to live in only four small patches of rainforest, but now a fifth location has been confirmed.
Naturalist Ian Morris says he first saw the butterfly 30 years ago, but was only recently able to confirm it was the gove crow.
"It certainly extends its range by a few hundred kilometres, but probably doesn't stop them being an endangered or threatened species simply because the habitat they live in is so restricted and unique that any disturbance to that could soon cause a crash in their population," he said.
