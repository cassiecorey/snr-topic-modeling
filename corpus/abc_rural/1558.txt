Lindemans to include foreign wine
The Foster's Group says it will sell South African and Chilean wine under its Lindemans brand, which has traditionally been exclusively Australian.
The beverage giant says it is a result of research in key export markets, which shows shoppers buy wine because it is good value for money, rather than its origin.
But some in the local industry says the Foster's research undermines efforts being made to market wine under the "Wine Australia" banner.
Mike Stone from Murray Valley Winegrowers says the move should serve as a warning for wine grape producers.
"How long before we have major Australian wine companies simply buying grapes from the cheapest source?" he said.
"Does it mean that even in a few years' time that Australian wine grape growers will be in competition with growers from other countries?
