Cole blasts AWB for withholding crucial email
A furious oil-for-food inquiry Commissioner Terence Cole has blasted lawyers for AWB following the overnight production of a crucial email.
After an hour-long delay to proceedings, Commissioner Cole entered the court room in a fiery mood.
He demanded an explanation from AWB about how the August 2002 email and its attachments from the head of UK-based Ronly Holdings, to AWB in-house lawyer, Rosemary Peevey, was not produced months ago.
A contrite counsel for AWB, James Judd QC, told the commission the email was a crucial document and had it been produced months ago, the length of the Cole inquiry would have been shortened.
