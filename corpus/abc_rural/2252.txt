German fan club raises RFDS funds
A German-based fan club of the 1980s TV series, The Flying Doctors, have raised $25,000 for the real Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS).
The German RFDS fan club began 11 years ago after members fell in love with the series which is still screening in Europe.
President Renate Kaldenhoff says money is raised through memberships and selling photographs signed by the stars of the show.
"It must be nearly 25,000, I always say my fans are really great," she said.
