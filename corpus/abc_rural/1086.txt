Victorian water traders set new record
There is more evidence of growing agricultural water sales in Victoria, with a record amount of permanent water traded in the state's north-west last financial year.
Almost 26,000 megalitres of additional water moved into the region, mainly from upstream along the Murray River.
Owen Russell from Lower Murray Water says most of the new water is being used by almond growers between Robinvale and Nyah.
"We've seen water come in effectively from out of the Goulburn Murray irrigation district region," he said.
