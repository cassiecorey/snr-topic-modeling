Warmer seas could be affecting lobster catches
Victorian fisheries officers say rising sea temperatures could be one factor causing a drop in rock lobster catches off the state's west coast.
Government monitoring programs and independent surveys have found the amount of lobsters fishermen have been able to catch has dropped by 10 percent in two years.
Peter Appleford from Fisheries Victoria says it could be some time before scientists can establish whether it is due to environmental change, but some trends are emerging.
"It's been noted that the water temperatures have been higher than normal," he said.
"It's also been noted that in western Victoria there's been less frequent and weaker cold water upwellings which affect the fishery.
