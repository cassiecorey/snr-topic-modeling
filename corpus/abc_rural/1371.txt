Horsemanship course improves youths' job prospects
A group of young men from a remote Aboriginal community in north Queensland
have improved their job prospects and way of life by learning how to handle horses.
Twenty horses were seized from Palm Island three years ago in what the RSPCA said was one of the worst cases of animal cruelty it had seen.
State Government intervention has provided more infrastructure and equipment to deal with the hundreds of wild and domesticated horses on the island.
Ten young men, including Thomas Chookie, have been taking part in a horsemanship course near Ingham.
"I learnt so much ... I I built a greater self-confidence too and self-esteem, like how to be one with something that you can't really tame," he said.
