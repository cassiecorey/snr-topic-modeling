Banana industry looks at cyclone-proofing
The banana industry is looking at ways to become cyclone-proof to avoid a repeat of this year's shortage.
The Australian Banana Growers Council wants to strengthen smaller growing areas, such as Western Australia's Gascoyne to ensure customer demand can be met.
Cyclone Larry wiped out most of north Queensland's crop in March, driving up the price of available fruit.
Spokesman Tony Heidrich says markets and retailers need to allow smaller growing areas to keep a foothold in the market once Queensland fruit returns.
"You'll never completely cyclone proof the industry," he said.
"But what we're saying is we've obviously got a real problem this time around in having such a big cyclone knock out so much of our production.
