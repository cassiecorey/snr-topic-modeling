Wheat futures near all-time highs
A global share market fall in mineral and energy stocks is having unexpected benefits for wheat prices, with futures markets at or near all-time highs.
Analysts say speculative funds appear to be pouring money into wheat, as they turn away from oil, gold and copper.
Wheat prices on the Chicago Futures Exchange rose again overnight, to around $AUD220 per tonne.
Brett Stevenson, from Market Check, says even better prices are being offered for wheat for March 2008 and 2009, and at around $250 a tonne, they are just below the 1995 record.
"We are faced for the first time a situation where the forward prices three years in the future are at extraordinarily high levels, nearly records," Mr Brett Stevenson said.
"We have got massive amounts of money invested into the metals. We think some of that money maybe coming in to the soft commodity funds in other words, wheat, you know, grains, that sort of thing.
