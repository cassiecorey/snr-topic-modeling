Top ag commodity forecaster wraps up after 18 years
Today marks the last day on the job for the head of the nation's peak commodity forecaster.
Brian Fisher has been director of the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics since 1988.
He admits it has not been an easy job to forecast the vagaries of Australian agriculture, but says it has been important to give farmers the most up-to-date information available.
"The facts need to be on the table - sometimes there are more or less diplomatic ways of getting them on the table, but in the final analysis farmers need to know the facts," he said.
