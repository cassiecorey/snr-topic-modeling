Fishermen not hopeful of major change to illegal fishing surveillance
Fishermen in the Gulf of Carpentaria are not expecting too much out of a meeting between federal Fisheries Minister Eric Abetz and his Indonesian counterpart today in Brisbane.
Senator Abetz is expected to ask the Indonesians to help patrol northern waters to curb illegal fishing but local fishermen say that will not address the damage already done to their fishery by foreign boats.
Chairman of Gulf fishermen Gary Ward says greater surveillance would be welcome but he is not hopeful of major change.
