McGuigan Simeon writes down wine stocks
Wine company McGuigan Simeon will write down wine stocks by up to $20 million and will not pay a final dividend to its shareholders this year.
On Monday the company asked the Australian Stock Exchange to halt its trading until this morning, when the results of an operational review were released.
Managing director Dane Hudson says the company was forced to write down stocks because of the recent decline in bulk wine prices.
"It's a small percentage of our total stock," he said.
"This is probably a 9 per cent reduction and it's for older vintages. We are comfortable with our 2006 vintage but this is older stock that we need to reprice to clear on the bulk market."
