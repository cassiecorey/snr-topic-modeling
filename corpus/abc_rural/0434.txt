Agfest crowds brave the Tassie cold
It has been a chilly start to Tasmania's annual rural field days, Agfest, in the state's north.
Coffee sales are up but farm machinery sales are expected to be down.
Querkus Park is a sea of tents, marquees and pavilions, and with an early taste of winter chills, stalls with heaters are proving very popular today.
Agfest is the major gathering for rural industries with more than 700 exhibitors and sales are seen as a barometer of the state's rural industries.
This year, sales are expected to reflect the contract cuts in the poppy and vegetable industries.
The bright spot though is the buoyant dairy industry.
