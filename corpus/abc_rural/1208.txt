Company to streamline Australian operation
Further rationalisation is occurring across the international wine industry.
One of the world's largest international beverage alcohol producers, Constellation Brands, says it will streamline its Australian operation.
Constellation owns the South Australian-based Hardys Wine Company and plans to buyout some grape supply and processing contracts, and sell non-strategic assets.
