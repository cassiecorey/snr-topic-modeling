Grain harvest under way
The grain harvest has commenced in Victoria's Mallee and some grain growers say they are surprised by yields.
With less than 100 millimetres of rain during the growing season, farmers have been expecting a small harvest.
In the Millewa, in the state's north-west, farmer Colin Hunt says some wheat crops are yielding up to one tonne per hectare, a bit above expectation.
