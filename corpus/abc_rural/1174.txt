Money needs to be spent on ports upgrade, inquiry chief says
The head of a federal inquiry into port, rail and road infrastructure says most of the nation's significant ports need upgrades worth around $80 million each.
Nationals Member for Hinkler in Queensland Paul Neville says money will need to be spent to protect Australian exports of minerals, grain, timber and mineral sands.
He says transport networks in general are having trouble keeping up with the needs of the export sector.
"We have found that at nearly every port there is a need for some sort of improvement to the connectivity between the main road and rail freight truck routes and the ports themselves," he said.
"Now it varies from port to port and at one it might be a new rail connection, in another one it might be a ring road around the port and another the widening of the channels into the ports.
"We feel they could probably do it a bit better."
