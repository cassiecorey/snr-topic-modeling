Strawberry prices tipped to fall
Strawberry prices could fall dramatically later this year.
Queensland's strawberry season is under way, with growers enjoying the best prices they have seen in over a decade - up to $8 a punnet in some supermarkets.
But Bill Sharpe, from the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association, says there will be an oversupply and rock-bottom prices by September.
"Somewhere along the line the middle man get certainly the benefit of it with this oversupply, but the blame is sort of twofold anyway," he said.
