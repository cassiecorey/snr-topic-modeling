Email questions
Today at the inquiry, AWB trading manager Peter Geary has been questioned about an email he received in May 2000.
It indicated that the Iraqi Grains Board had approached AWB to provide "after-sales service".
Mr Geary said he had forwarded the email to two AWB colleagues and did not remember reading it, although he said he may have skimmed it.
