Managed investment schemes under review
Concerns are emerging over the shift in managed investment schemes (MIS) from forestry and vineyards to broader agriculture.
Plantings of walnuts and avocados are among those now being offered to investors.
Rob Dalton, from Avocados Australia, says he is concerned by the push, which could massively distort the market.
"Reviews of MISs have indicated that the investors are in there primarily for the tax deduction and they have much less concern with profitability at the end of the project," he said.
"Whereas the normal farmer is in there for a profit and a long-term, sustainable profit.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran is also concerned about the impact of MISs.
"When they start going into wine grapes and citrus and avocadoes where there is well-established Australian industries, that is of enormous concern," he said.
