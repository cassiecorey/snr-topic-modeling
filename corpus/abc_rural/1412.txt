Cornish looks to halt SAFF infighting
The South Australian Farmers Federation (SAFF) has appointed a new president as it attempts to stop falling membership levels.
Wayne Cornish, who headed up SAFF between 1995 and 1999, has been returned to the top job.
He has just completed six years as vice president of the National Farmers Federation.
Mr Cornish says he hopes to bring unity to the SAFF, which has been plagued by infighting.
"There has been in recent days too much of a temptation to do our dirty washing in public and that is going to stop," he said.
