Murray Irrigation to introduce cost cutting measures
The country's largest private irrigation company, Murray Irrigation, expects to lose several million dollars this financial year because of the drought.
The company will introduce a four day week from mid-November, reduce its weed control programs and defer maintenance in a bid to cut costs.
General manager George Warne says directors' fees will also be reduced by 20 per cent.
