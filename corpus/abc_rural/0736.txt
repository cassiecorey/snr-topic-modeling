Desert race comes to an end
Australia's most challenging off-road race is coming to an end at Alice Springs.
Hundreds of competitors in the Finke Desert Race have pitched their buggies, cars and motorbikes at 450 kilometres of some of the toughest terrain in the country.
It is windy, freezing cold and extremely dusty at the 31st Finke Desert Race.
Only a third of competitors usually complete the track, which is full of bulldust, desert oak trees to dodge and about 70 kilometres of woops which is like driving over thousands of volkswagons in a row.
Already the winners in the buggies have made it home, first place went to father/son team Shannon and Ian Wrench from Warrnambool, Victoria.
