Govt, Telstra assurances sought for 3G rollout
The Federal Government is under pressure to regulate the rollout of Telstra's new 3G mobile phone network, to make sure rural Australia is not disadvantaged when the current CDMA service is shutdown.
Telstra has promised it will not turn-off CDMA before January 2008, even if the 3G network has reached equivalent coverage before then.
But in Senate Estimates hearings yesterday National Party Senator Fiona Nash told Telstra representatives, regional areas deserve more than just assurances from the phone company.
"But what if I just take you back to the Extel example and early on in the desk top study and the work that had been done in terms on what could be rolled out technologically, and now it seems that, 'oops that wasn't quite right'? What I'm trying to make sure for those people that live out in regional Australia that we don't get to the end of the rollout and hear from Telstra again, 'oops we didn't get that quite right'."
