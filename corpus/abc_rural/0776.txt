Cowra meatworks dispute settled
An industrial dispute at a meatworks in New South Wales, which gained national attention, has been settled.
The Cowra abattoir dismissed a number of employees, offering their jobs back at a much lower pay rates, under the new industrial relations laws.
Under political pressure, the company reinstated the employees under their previous award, while pay negotiations took place.
State Meatworkers Union secretary, Charlie Donzow, says while some workers will receive less money, the pay is much higher than the dismissed workers had been offered.
"The area where they won't gain as much is when the company goes into levels of production over and above the minimum they put in place now," he said.
