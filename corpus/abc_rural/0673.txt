Tas cow tests positive for hydatid tapeworm
A Tasmanian bred cow has tested positive for the hydatid tapeworm, the state's first case in a decade.
Tasmania embarked on a world leading hydatid eradication program 40 years ago and while hydatids have been discovered since, most have been traced to imported stock.
The state was declared provisionally-free of hydatid disease in 1996.
Chief vet Rod Andrewartha says the infected cow was part of a mixed line of cattle.
"Occasionally of course we will detect cysts and we can normally trace them back to sheep or cattle imported from the mainland, in this particular case we found it in an animal which was born and bred in Tasmania," he said.
