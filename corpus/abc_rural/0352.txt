Newcastle shipment may provide new export opportunities
A live export shipment has left the port of Newcastle in New South Wales for the first time in years.
The ship, carrying 980 dairy cows, will arrive in Japan in a fortnight.
Cameron Hall from LiveCorp says it could be a new opportunity for the dairy sector in a state not known for live animal exports.
