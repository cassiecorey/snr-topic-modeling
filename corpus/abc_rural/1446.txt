Victorian ram takes out Supreme Merino title
A superfine ram from Victoria has taken out one of the wool industry's most prestigious awards.
Champion rams from five states competed for the Supreme Merino Ram title last night at the National Merino Sheep Show at Dubbo in central western New South Wales.
The ram Rockbank Dozer, from the Rockbank Stud at Dunkeld in Victoria's west, was named the best.
"He's 16 micron and he's a very large ram for that quality - he's 130 kilos," stud principal John Crawford said.
