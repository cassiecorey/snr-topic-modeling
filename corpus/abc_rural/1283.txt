Supply increase slashes macadamia prices
An increased world supply has cut the price of macadamia nuts by almost half and investors are counting the cost.
Up to 20 per cent of macadamia farms have changed hands in the past two years, due to strong demand and sustained industry growth.
But Andrew Heap, from the Australian Macadamia Society, says increasing fuel costs and mortgage repayments has now hit consumer demand.
He says over-investment on some farms will create problems.
"Most of those investors have been in a financial position to pay more than the agricultural value say these farms are worth," he said.
