Cape calls for cyclone assistance
Graziers, tourism operators and Indigenous communities on Cape York are calling for immediate financial help from the Federal Government in the wake of Cyclone Monica.
The cyclone brought heavy rain and severe flooding to the cape, and graziers say there been widespread damage to roads, and huge stock losses.
The Cape communities want to know why they cannot access the same assistance offered to victims of cyclone Larry.
Cape grazier Darcy Burns says they are desperate.
"It looks like Larry's got everything," he said.
"We're not hearing one word on Monica, I think people have forgotten how much damage that's done up there.
"We understand fully about Innisfail's done and they need all the support they can get, we're not knocking that at all, but they've also got to look at us as well, there's people up there at the moment, we've lost our income for the next 12 months because we can't get in there, and the season's so short now."
