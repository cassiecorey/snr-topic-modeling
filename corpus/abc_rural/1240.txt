20,000 sheep up for sale online
The sheep market is strong, with more than 20,000 sheep up for sale on the Internet in Queensland.
That is three times the usual number.
Richard Murray from Landmark at Longreach says most of the sheep offered on Auctions Plus come from properties in western Queensland.
He says graziers are capitalising on strong demand for young ewes from central New South Wales, although abattoir-ready sheep are dominating the market.
"With the processor sheep, usually from mid August the prices tend to ease back a bit, so naturally people are trying to get their sheep onto the market before then," he said.
"It also fits in with the shearings, most of the shearings are done and they're sort of six to eight weeks off the board now, which is an ideal time to be selling the sheep."
