Scientists consider climate change challenges
Scientists are meeting in Sydney today to tackle climate change.
The scientists from CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Greenhouse Office are debating strategies they say need to be implemented to adapt to the changing climate.
Principal scientist with the CSIRO, Kevin Hennessy says it is likely farmers will be forced to make big changes.
"We would need to look at improving water use efficiency, water recycling, so reduce the amount of evaporation from some of our irrigation channels, and smarter ways of farming, for example direct drilling of seeds, retaining the stubble to reduce both erosion and water usage, and I guess some challenges for the types of crops that we use," he said.
