Pyrethrum prices cut
Tasmanian crop farmers have been dealt another blow, a cut in pyrethrum prices.
Tasmania is the world's second largest producer of the daisy, which is used to make natural insecticide.
Growers group chairman Scott Langton says the 5 per cent price cut has been attributed to a world oversupply and is likely to halt further development.
"What we're really after is just a fair and equitable return so that we can still maintain forward advancement in technology so that we're ready to take up new technology that comes on," he said.
