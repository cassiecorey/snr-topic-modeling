Call for community projects for work-for-the-dole participants
Community projects are being sought for work-for-the-dole programs in Broken Hill, Menindee and Wilcannia.
Sureway Employment chief executive officer, Judy Galloway, says two projects are already under way in Broken Hill but more are needed.
She says the projects are for not for profit organisations and provide an opportunity for people to gain skills that could lead to part time or full time employment.
Mrs Galloway says participants can not take the place of paid employees.
"So it has to be additional work which is something of a community benefit," she said.
