Govt urged to acquire Snowy Hydro
A New South Wales parliamentary inquiry has called on the Federal Government to acquire Snowy Hydro, but to guarantee the electricity generator remain in public hands.
Inquiry chairman the Reverend Gordon Moyes says Snowy Hydro needs a capital injection of $800 million to remain viable in the national electricity market, but that share holding governments are reluctant to fund it.
