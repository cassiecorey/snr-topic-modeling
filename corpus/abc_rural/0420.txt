Restraint boxes to improve cattle slaughter in SE Asia
Australia is investing almost a million dollars to improve the slaughter of cattle in South-East Asia.
Fifty restraint boxes are being installed at abattoirs across Indonesia and Malaysia.
The aim is to ensure all Australian cattle are processed humanely within two years.
Meat and Livestock Australia's Patrick Underwood says he is confident the boxes will be used.
"It's a fully galvanised and enclosed box, whereby the animal enters through a raceway into an abattoir, is placed in a restraining box and restrained prior to slaughter," he said.
"I have formed an animal welfare task force, with members of APFINDO (the Indonesian feedlotters and farmers association), so the Indonesian importers are with us, illustrating the clear benefits of using these restraining boxes."
