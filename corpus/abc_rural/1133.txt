Grain prices rise as US turns to ethanol
The rising cost of fuel in America is having a positive impact on Australian wheat prices, according to an agriculture publication.
More consumers in the US are turning to corn-based ethanol, increasing corn consumption by 15 per cent to 60 million tonnes and boosting prices by up to 20 per cent.
Richard Koch from Profarmer says the US corn price sets the basis for the global feed grain market, which will have spin offs for Australian wheat and canola growers.
"I've seen some analysis that indicates the value of soft commodities in the medium-term could increase six-fold," he said.
