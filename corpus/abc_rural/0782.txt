GM cotton row heats up
Debate over genetically-modified (GM) cotton in northern Australia is heating up, with two biotechnology companies applying to the Commonwealth regulator for licences.
The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) rejected a similar proposal four years ago, which means GM cotton cannot be grown commercially in the Australian tropics.
Environmental groups say any new GM cotton could become established as a tropical weed.
But Ord River farmer Rob Boshammer says it is unfair that the north is missing out on the new technology.
"I think it is a very dangerous situation where parts of the country can be allowed to use technology and other parts not," he said.
"It seems totally unfair to me if you live one side of the 26th parallel you can grow GM cotton, if you live a metre the other side of the 26th parallel you can't. It seems to put an economic impost on us."
