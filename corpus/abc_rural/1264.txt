Forrest defends decision to abstain on migration Bill
Former National party chief whip John Forrest says his decision not to support the Federal Government's controversial migration legislation is based on his personal experience of refugees' contribution to rural Australia.
Mr Forrest resigned from the position yesterday after abstaining from the vote on the plan to detain and process all asylum seekers offshore.
The Victorian-based member for Mallee says he has supported the visa cases of asylum seekers working in horticulture and local abattoirs and has visted others in detention.
"We have literally got thousands of refugees living amongst us, more particularly along the Murray Valley but they are spread right across the electorate," he said.
"When people meet these folks and listen to their story, their perception about them changes.
