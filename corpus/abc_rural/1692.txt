Vaile outlines trade achievements
Outgoing Trade Minister Mark Vaile says while world trade talks have been disappointing, he has delivered benefits to farmers.
Mr Vaile is swapping portfolios with Transport Minister Warren Truss today.
He says putting agriculture at the centre of world trade talks, free trade deals with the US and other countries, and forcing Europe to remove some sugar subsidies have been victories.
"Achieving that win saw the EU having to remove the export subsidies from 4 million tonnes of sugar annually and it has seen a significant increase in the global price of sugar," he said.
