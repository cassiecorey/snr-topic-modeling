Patchy rainfall welcomed across NSW
Inland New South Wales has received its most widespread rainfall in more than three months.
Falls over the past 24 hours have been patchy, with 50 millimetres in the state's north but nothing in some central and western districts.
But farmers in the central west say any rain is welcome.
"We had 26 millimetres in two storms. One yesterday afternoon and one sometime early this morning," one farmer said.
"Certainly some of our later paddocks, which we were saving for seed, it will help them. It won't help the yield but it will help the grain size."
Another farmer said: "Two storms, one yesterday afternoon, 24 millimetres in 15 minutes and didn't it come down."
"Two storms, one yesterday afternoon with five millimetres and then another one about 4:00am (AEDT), and we picked up 16 millimetres. A little bit of heavy stuff in it," a third farmer said.
"[We got] about half a millimetre, we can't measure anything under that," a fourth farmer said.
