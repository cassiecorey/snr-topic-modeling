Trading hours row closes Palace Hotel
One of the country's most famous outback hotels has called last drinks for the last time after failing to win a bid to trade for 24 hours.
The Palace Hotel in Broken Hill opened in the 1880s and achieved worldwide fame by appearing in the film Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
But last night, owner Marat Celotto shut the doors, saying his business was doomed following the council's refusal to extend his trading hours.
"It's a very hard decision at the moment," he said.
