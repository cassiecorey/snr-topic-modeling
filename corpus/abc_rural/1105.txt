Councils come to farmers' aid
With Western Australia in the grip of a dry year, local councils are looking for different ways to help farmers who are struggling to grow a crop this season.
The Shire of Mullewa and the Shire of Chapman Valley will offer road works and community project works to farmers, so they can generate an income.
Mullewa president Nino Messina says the council has received extra funding for road works and employing farmers makes sense.
"The harvesting will come and farmers won't be able to do anything because they'll have no crop to harvest," he said.
The Queensland Nationals are calling on the Federal Government for better measures to protect regional media diversity under its proposed changes to media ownership laws.
The Nationals want the Government to set a mandate for local radio content and legislation to prevent a single company from owning more than two out of three news services in regional centres, including television, radio and newspapers.
But lecturer in media policy and research at the University of Western Sydney Dr Tim Dwyer says the provisions in the Nationals' resolution fall well short of any sort of guarantee to provide a diverse range of local news.
