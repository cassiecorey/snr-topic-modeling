Hay exports under cloud
A 200,000 to 300,000 tonne shortfall is putting export orders for hay in jeopardy this year.
With dry conditions, forecasts for the oaten hay crop have fallen by half, leaving farmers unable to fill contract orders.
One of the country's largest export companies, Balco Australia, says it will take hay made from failed wheat crops to make up the shortfall.
Marketing director Murray Smith says farmers will not make as much money, but at least they will receive a return for their crops.
"It's probably only about $10 a tonne, mainly because a lot of the wheat is bearded and is not exactly what they want, but hopefully for the growers they can get a bit of a yield from their crop," he said.
