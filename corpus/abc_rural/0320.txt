Farmers expected to get tax concessions
Farmers look set to win capital gains tax concessions in the federal Budget to cut the cost of passing down family farms.
There could also be a billion dollar budget bonus for rural roads with the National party believed to have secured money to link strategic roads to ports.
Currently many farmers pay huge capital gains tax bills when they sell their farm because rising rural land prices have pushed their farm value above a $5 million threshold.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says that means producers can no longer access small business tax concessions, making farm succession planning a costly process.
Reports now suggest the Government will allow more farmers to get the tax concession.
NFF chief executive Ben Fargher says the mooted changes make sense.
"Current rules mean farmers are clicked out of being able to access those exemptions, we've asked the Government to look at it," he said.
There is also speculation the Government is considering a $1 billion roads package aimed at Queensland's Bruce and Hume Highways.
Nationals leader Mark Vaile will not confirm the spending but says he is in favour of more roads funding.
