Iraq market
AWB's national pool manager David Johnson denies the oil-for-food inquiry is having an impact on trade and says Australia has not lost Iraq as a major market.
He says AWB submitted a tender to supply a million tonnes of wheat to Iraq last week.
"We'll be looking to participate in that tender, absolutely," he said.
"Probably relatively, compared to the structure of the market in previous years, this pool return might look a little different but the world market is different.
"I think it's just a fact that the export business is extremely quiet and I think you'd find the same comments from other exporting countries around the world."
AWB has announced an increase to new season pool estimates, lifting the returns for hard wheat by $2.00 a tonne and for noodle grades by $4.00 a tonne.
There is a mixed outlook for other grains.
Record soy bean harvests in the US, Ukraine and Brazil mean there is a large global supply of the canola alternative, which will put pressure on oil seed prices in Australia.
David Syme from the WA Grain Pool says malting barley sales have been slow due to the Chinese New Year but sales should soon pick up.
"At this point in time, Australia really has been holding the major stocks of malting barley around the world," he said.
"The Canadians don't have a lot to offer to the marketplace, that puts us in a good position and of course the next lot of supplies of malting barley really come out of Europe in August, so some time away yet.
"Once the Chinese re-emerge we look forward to a strong selling program."
