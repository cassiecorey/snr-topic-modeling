Nut growers look to overseas markets
Macadamia nut growers are looking offshore for markets for their near record production levels.
With falling consumer demand here in Australia, growers are taking advantage of reduced tariffs for value-added products which were introduced as part of the United States Free Trade Agreement.
Jim Twentyman from Suncoast Gold Macadamias in south-east Queensland says tariffs will be reduced to zero by 2008.
"At the moment, because of the duty reason, we're having to have that packed and processed in the USA so we believe from next year we'll be able to do the packaging and processing in Australia," he said.
