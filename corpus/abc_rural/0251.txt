Petition
Meanwhile a petition supported by some of the leading lights in the legal profession is calling for a widening of the inquiry's terms of reference.
Lawyers, barristers and academics from the University of New South Wales say AWB and the Federal Government may have violated international law by allowing bribes to be paid to Saddam Hussein.
Petition leader Ben Sawell says it is now clear the powers of the Cole inquiry are too narrow.
"There is a great deal of concern in the legal profession about the conduct of the Australian Government in all of this business of the oil-for-food scandal," he said.
