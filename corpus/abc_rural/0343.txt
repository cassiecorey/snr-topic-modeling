Teleworking project aimed at helping rural women
A new project is trying to get more rural women in jobs without having to leave home.
Teleworking would allow women to utilise their education and professional experience without the need to travel long distances.
Chris Capel from the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women says getting companies to take on teleworkers is the biggest challenge.
"It'll be convincing employers and business [that] will be the major hurdle I think," she said.
