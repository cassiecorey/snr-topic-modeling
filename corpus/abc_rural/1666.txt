Wesfarmers to build LNG plant
Wesfarmers is to build a $138 million liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Kwinana, near Perth.
The plant will produce 175 tonnes per day of LNG for use in heavy haulage vehicles.
Two power stations will also be built at remote mine sites to provide energy for those operations.
Construction of the LNG plant will begin soon and it is scheduled to be commissioned in early 2008.
Wesfarmers energy managing director Tim Bult says the company is confident of expanding operations elsewhere in Australia.
