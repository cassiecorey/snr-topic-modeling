Grain growers expecting above average yields
While grain growers across the country watch their crops die, one small group of growers are set to reap at least average yields, in one of the most unlikely spots.
Farms in the Nundroo and Coorabie districts of South Australia, near the Nullarbor Plain in the state's far west, had good summer rains, which were followed up in April.
Local farmer Peter Stott says some paddocks have had above average rain.
"We'll go close to an average season hopefully," he said.
"We seemed to have copped a little bit more rainfall here, especially towards the coast.
