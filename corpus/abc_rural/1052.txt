In Queensland there were some good falls in the parched west and south-west, but little rain fell in the south-east, where dam levels are at critical levels.
Quilpie grazier Brian Rutledge says the 60 millimetres in his rain gauge is the best in six years.
But Mr Rutledge says much more is needed if the region is to recover from drought and lose its title of "heartbreak corner".
"It has been dubbed heartbreak corner in the years gone by and it is certainly living up to its name," he said.
