Meatworks struggle to cope with livestock influx
Meatworks in northern Tasmania are working overtime to cope with a big influx of livestock due to the dry conditions.
Tasmanian Quality Meats spokesman Brian Oliver at Cressy says farmers are becoming increasingly desperate to get rid of stock.
The small plant is processing 2,500 sheep and 2,000 lambs a week and Mr Oliver says there is at least a month-long wait to get stock through.
"We are just struggling to keep in front, we are working six days a week and we are just looking at putting in an afternoon shift in the boning room to try and move some more numbers," he said.
