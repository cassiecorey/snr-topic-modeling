Crop growth slow across the region
The district agronomist with the Department of Primary Industries, Jan Edwards, says frosts in Cowra have seen germination of wheat and canola crops slow down. Ms Edwards says weeds will be a big problem as a lot of crop was dry sown and so weeds will emerge with the crops. This will be similar to last year.
