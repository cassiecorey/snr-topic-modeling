Mundubberra mandarins headed for China
The first export shipment of citrus fruit to China has left Australia.
Previously fruit entered China through the so-called "grey channel" via Hong Kong.
On Friday a container of honey murcott mandarins from Mundubberra in Queensland's central Burnett region left under China's strict new export protocols.
The shipment will reach Beijing towards the end of the month, meaning fruit supplier Alan Jenkins has a nervous wait.
"We've done everything, we hope, right at this end," he said.
"We've been certified and inspected by AQIS, and we hope that's in line when it gets to China.
