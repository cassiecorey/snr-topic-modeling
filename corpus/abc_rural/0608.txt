PM defends vote on Snowy Hydro sale
Prime Minister John Howard has rejected legal opinion that a vote on the sale of the Commonwealth's share in Snowy Hydro is unconstitutional.
He says the Government will press on with the sale, despite admitting most Australians are against it.
Opposition to the sale has built considerably since the Government and Labor agreed on a motion seven weeks ago, which cleared the way for the sell-off.
The Greens and some government members say they have legal advice the Parliament should have voted on legislation, and not just passed a parliamentary motion.
"The process of getting parliamentary approval for the sale of commonwealth Snowy Hydro shares is illegal," said Greens leader Bob Brown.
Mr Howard expects to hear more opposition from within his own party to the sale next week, but says his own legal advice is clear.
