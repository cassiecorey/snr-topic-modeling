REMOTE BUT EFFECTIVE
A new survey suggests that landholders in isolated areas should be using remote monitoring technology to save more time and money.
The Kondinin farm research group travelled Australia looking into technology, such as virtual fencing, walkover weighing and remote controlled helicopter mustering.
And Research and Development Manager Ben White says they found remote water monitoring had the most potential to improve efficiency on properties.
The report, funded by Meat and Livestock Australia, will be released in February.
KIWI WOMEN CHIP IN TO HELP IN BUSHFIRE BATTLE
New Zealand farming women are offering help to Australian families affected by the bushfires.
Rural Women New Zealand is trying to find out what help is needed, so members can raise money, or send food parcels.
President Sherryl Dackers says the group has been in email contact with similar women's networks in Victoria.
"From Australia we've had the suggestion that we may be able to support some women who probably after this disaster won't be able to afford to go to a conference which is being held in Australia, and also with food parcels.
"What we as rural women New Zealand would like know is what your rural people would need in way of assistance√Ç".
