Call for more climate research to maintain wheat production
There is a warning today that wheat production could fall by 15 per cent and cost the nation $1 billion over the next 30 years unless the grains industry steps up research into managing climate change.
A study of five major grain growing areas show a drop in production of between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, with shorter growing periods and higher threats from diseases and pests as the country gets warmer and drier.
Professor Peter Grace from the Institute of Sustainable Resources in Queensland, says farmers may need to look to new wheat varieties and better use natural resources like water.
"Drought resistance is probably the number one area we need to get into in Australia," he said.
"We have a long history of scientists who have done a lot of work in traditional plant breeding in drought resistance and have been very successful, so we're well positioned to meet what's going to happen in the next 30 to 50 years.
"Global warming is here, that is a proven fact. Farmers play a role in that as well by moving towards conservation tillage practices, so farmers are in the driver's seat."
Meanwhile, Western Australia's grain handler and marketer the CBH Group is upbeat about the winter growing season, even though many areas desperately need rain.
CBH has released its first crop yield estimate for the year, with a ballpark figure of 11.6 million tonnes.
Operations manager David Fienberg says CBH's predictions are largely on good summer sub-soil moisture reserves across broadacre regions.
"What we do is, we try and collect as much on-ground intelligence in terms of being really well set-up for those from the summer rains," he said.
"And there is fantastic sub-soil moisture there in the majority of the state.
