US growers slam 'sham' Australian wheat deal
US Wheat Associates has accused Australia of putting together a sham deal to sell wheat to Iraq.
Loading has begun in Geelong of the first shipment of wheat to Iraq since a ban was imposed on trade with AWB earlier this year.
US Wheat Associates claims the Wheat Australia consortium's 350,000 tonne contract is just a way for AWB to get around the ban.
It accuses AWB of selling to Iraq from its wheat pool through the consortium.
Rebecca Coleman says AWB still controls the pricing.
"We think that the Wheat Australia situation is pretty much a shell game, a sham and a way that allows for AWB to continue to funnel wheat to Iraq and avoid the sanctions that are currently in place," she said.
Ms Coleman says Iraq is now one of the US's top 10 wheat customers.
