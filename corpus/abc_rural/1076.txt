Bagasse project's potential excites mill manager
Yesterday morning you might have heard Gordon Edwards talking about his plans to process and then sell Bagasse from the Mossman Mill to buyers in Japan.
Mr Edward's company Kristevefourspace has formed a joint venture with the mill and the plan is to sell bagasse fibre as a healthy food additive.
He says there is a strong demand for bagasse because the Japanese Government is pushing for an increased fibre content in school children's lunches.
Mr Edwards says if everything goes according to plan they should produce about $17.5 million worth of bagasse fibre.
"We currently have a joint venture agreement with the mill where we pay for all consumables with a percentage of gross on top so the mill can't lose out," he said.
"The value of bagasse powder compared to raw sugar is ten to one.
"Basically 40-50 cents for raw sugar, $5 a kilo for bagasse powder."
He says one processing machine has already been installed at the mill and soon three more will be in place.
Mossman Mill manager Alan Johnstone says he is excited about the bagasse project's potential because the technology has already been trialed in Okinawa and he hopes the Mossman trial proves equally successful.
Mr Johnstone says so far only a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the mill and Kristevefourspace and nothing is in writing regarding the breakdown of future profits.
