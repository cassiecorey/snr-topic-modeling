Drought predicted to worsen
There is another gloomy forecast today that suggests the drought is set to worsen.
The weather bureau is predicting a hotter than average lead-up to summer right across the country and below-average rain in most of eastern Australia.
The seasonal outlook from October to December says there is up to a 70 per cent chance that northern Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania will be drier than normal.
Bureau climatologist Blair Trewin says temperatures will be generally higher than normal.
"The outlook is leaning quite strongly towards warm conditions in much of the country both daytime maximum and overnight minimum temperatures," he said.
