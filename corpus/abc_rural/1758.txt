Govt vows $50m for rural mental health clinics
The Federal Government has offered another $50 million in funding for mental health clinics in rural areas.
The Prime Minister, John Howard, says it will help double the level of access to mental health professionals for country residents.
Mr Howard says his government will also spend $500 million expanding the Medicare Rebate system, so that more people can get mental health services through GPs, psychiatrists and psychologists.
Mr Howard says it is part of a $1.6 billion program launched with state governments earlier this year.
"We will be committing some $51.7 million over five years to target areas of need by funding organisations like divisions of general practice and Aboriginal medical services to establish and run mental health clinical services in rural and remote communities."
