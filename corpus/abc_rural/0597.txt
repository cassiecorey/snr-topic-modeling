Kraft cream cheese factory moves from Vic to SA
Locals in the northern Victorian town of Strathmerton say they are shocked at a decision by Kraft Foods to move cream cheese production out of the state.
A total of 150 employees will be affected by the restructure over the next two years, with the production being moved to Suttontown, near Mount Gambier, in south-east South Australia.
Former Strathmerton resident and the head of Moira Shire, Gavin Cator, says the news is devastating.
"The impact on the town, it's going to obviously have a huge impact in confidence," he said.
"We believe the dairy industry very has a good future, we have strong dairy industry in the Goulburn Murray valley, and it's disappointing that manufacturing components of it and the value adding we seek locally can't be provided."
