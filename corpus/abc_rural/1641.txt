Dry weather prompts Ash Wednesday comparisons
The nation's peak fire agency is warning that the dry conditions are already as bad as those leading up to the devastating Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983.
Fifty bushfires broke out across New South Wales over the weekend, ringing alarm bells for the Australasian Fire Authorities Council.
The Ash Wednesday fires in Victoria and South Australia were fuelled by hot winds after years of drought and killed more than 70 people.
The council's chief executive Len Foster says conditions are very similar this year.
"During August nationally we've had the warmest and hottest period on record," he said.
"Victoria had over 200 fires last week and New South Wales have 30 or 40 fires today.
"It's almost unheard of to have fires of that number and indeed that size in parts of Victoria as we're experiencing at the moment."
