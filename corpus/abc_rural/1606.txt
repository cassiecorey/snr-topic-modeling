Court orders surrender of secret AWB documents
The Federal Court has ordered AWB to surrender nearly half the bundle of 900 documents it tried to keep secret from the oil-for-food inquiry.
The bitter argument over the documents has stalled the inquiry's investigations for the past three months.
In handing down his orders, Justice Neil Young said his decision focused on three issues: whether AWB had established its claim, whether that claim had been waived by AWB's own internal inquiries and whether any fraud, sham or trickery had taken place.
Justice Young said 25 of the documents before him were not legitimate communications between AWB and its lawyers.
He said a further 316 showed AWB had waived its right to keep them secret when it carried out Project Rose and Project Water.
The six documents presented to Justice Young involving the Tigris transaction he described as being brought into existence for an improper and dishonest purpose.
Justice Young added another four to this category.
