Snowy Hydro accused of putting power before people
Irrigators in southern New South Wales are accusing electricity generator Snowy Hydro of putting power before people.
The company is under fire for holding back water from the Murray River.
Murray Irrigation says cut backs to water allocations have put stock and domestic supply to up to 2,000 farms at risk.
Director Kel Baxter says although Snowy Hydro is legally allowed to hold back the water it is morally wrong.
"I don't want to see the power grid fail we've got to have power but a little bit of power rationing because we're short of the water to generate the electricity with, is that too much to ask?" he said.
The NSW Minister for Natural Resources, Ian Macdonald says releasing the water would jeopardise electricity contracts.
"Snowy Hydro has enormous contracts that it is bound to abide by and if those contracts are broken then taxpayers will pay hundreds of millions of dollars," he said.
Snowy Hydro has refused to comment.
Meanwhile the Victorian Government is planning to resume environmental flows into the Hattah Lakes in the state's north-west.
The program to water red gums was halted on Friday while water resources were assessed.
The Department of Sustainability and Environment says another five gigalitres of water will now be pumped into the area, to top up the nine and a half gigalitres already used.
But Robert Mansell from the Murray Valley Citrus Board says horticulturalists do not want to see water being wasted.
"We all know that there's a shortage of water, we think that it probably needs to be managed a bit better," he said.
"It is just a principle in a time of drought.
