Mixed response to water buying scheme
There has been a mixed response to the launch of the Federal Government's first scheme to buy water from farmers for the environment.
The Government is offering to buy water from irrigators in the Southern Murray Darling Basin that is saved through on and off farm efficiency improvements.
Some irrigators say it will offer farmers a new source of income.
But Danny Lee from the Victorian Irrigators Council says with little irrigation water available, governments should be spending more money on water saving infrastructure.
"Right now we have a severe drought, nobody needs to be told that, farmers are on their knees, they are in a weakened state," he said.
