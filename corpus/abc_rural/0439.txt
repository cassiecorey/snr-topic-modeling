Crowds flock to Broken Hill for Agfair
The far western New South Wales city of Broken Hill is packed to capacity today, for the area's biggest biennial event.
There is not a spare motel room available in Broken Hill this weekend as swarms of people have converged into the city to celebrate Agfair.
Three hundred exhibitors are on show slightly down on two years ago, as organisers claim high petrol prices have discouraged some from travelling the distance.
