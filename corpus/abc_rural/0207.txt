Exporters concerned about Indonesian ban
Horticultural exporters say Indonesia has effectively banned imports of table grapes and other Australian produce, in retaliation for the Papuan asylum seeker affair.
Table grape shipments were stopped indefinitely yesterday afternoon after the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service received notification from Indonesia of a new export protocol, which exporters say is unworkable.
Indonesia is Australia's second biggest table grape market, worth more than $50 million.
Brian Ceresa from exporter John Holman and Company says he is in little doubt what has caused action from Indonesia.
"My personal suspicions are simply a knee-jerk reaction coming from the Indonesian Government over the refugee status of the West Papuan situation which has been well publicised over the last seven days," he said.
AQIS says it is trying to get to obtain more information about the export protocol, but believes it's likely to affect all countries, not just Australia.
Trade Minister Mark Vaile says he is now investigating the situation in Indonesia, but has not received any notification of an official ban on horticultural produce.
He say he will not consider compensation for exporters who might experience delays until more in known.
"I mean it's happened in the past and we'll have a look at the issue on its merits if that eventuates," he said.
