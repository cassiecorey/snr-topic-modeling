Rainfall figures recover in most areas
Although some parts of south-east Queensland are still very dry, the National Climate Centre says the rest of the country has done well out of recent rainfall.
The centre's latest drought statement shows rainfall figures have recovered in most areas over the past year, with isolated dry patches in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.
Climatologist Blair Trewin says charting rainfall patterns over three to 12 month periods can be helpful.
"Really the time scales that drought matters on depends on what you're trying to do," he said.
