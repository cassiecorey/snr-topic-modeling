Pastoralists brush up on first aid
Some of the Northern Territory's most isolated pastoralists are in Tennant Creek to improve their medical skills today, amid concerns over the future of health services.
Station managers and workers from around the Northern Territory's Barkly Tablelands have travelled hundreds of kilometres to the central Australian town of Tennant Creek for the annual Barkly Health Seminar.
Heavy rain and boggy roads has done nothing to keep people away at a time of uncertainty about the future of remote health services in the region.
Pastoralists have expressed concern that visits by health experts to pastoral stations may soon be cut back.
