Fears compo payments may restrict farmers' borrowing
Farmers who receive government-funded compensation payments are being warned they could have less leverage to borrow money from banks.
The issue has been highlighted in New South Wales, where compensation paid to ground water irrigators will be taxed as income.
Bruce Brown from Namoi Catchment Management says under the tax ruling, farmers who receive compensation for the loss of any property will see their asset base reduced.
"Banks would be seeing a loss of their loan security ratios which would obviously impact on the amounts of money they are prepared to lend because they will do their credit risk ratings etc on that," he said.
