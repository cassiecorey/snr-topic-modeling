Pressure
Dry conditions in Tasmania are putting pressure on farmers who have been agisting dairy cows for their Victorian colleagues.
Worsening seasonal conditions are making it harder for farmers to help, but farmer Greg Hall says they are doing their best.
"When we agreed to take an extra 100 or so heifers that was some six weeks ago because there was quite a bit of rough weather on Bass Strait it took some time to get them over," he said.
