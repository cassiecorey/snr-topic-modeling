Joint NT, WA pearling regulation agreed
The pearling industry will be regulated as one entity under a memorandum of understanding signed between the Northern Territory and Western Australia.
Most companies operate across both jurisdictions, stretching from the Territory's English Company Islands near Gove, to Exmouth in the Pilbara.
Captain Christopher Cleveland of Arafura Pearls says the agreement provides a platform to streamline regulations.
"There are some companies like ourselves, which don't have any involvement in Western Australia," he said.
