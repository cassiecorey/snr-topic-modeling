Don't ignore depression, doctors urge
Rural doctors say their already tight resources will be stretched as the drought drags on, but they are urging people to seek help for depression regardless.
The Rural Doctors Association says people feeling stressed and depressed to see their GPs early, because problems can become worse the longer they are untreated.
President Dr Peter Riesbieth says rural practices will have to prioritise their appointments, but it is important to ask for help.
