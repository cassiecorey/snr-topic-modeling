Nullabor Muster set to boost remote town's population
The population of the isolated Western Australian town of Rawlinna is set to boom as people arrive for the annual Nullabor Muster.
The muster is not just the main event for pastoralists on the Nullabor, it is their own event for the year.
And by tonight there will be literally hundreds of swags dotted across the ground.
It is a long way from anywhere, about four hours east of Kalgoorlie-Boulder on the railway line which connects the east and west of Australia.
