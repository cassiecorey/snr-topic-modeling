Concerns mount over wool quality
Concerns are growing in the wool market over the amount of pool quality wool on offer.
Despite a weaker Australian dollar, the market has dropped significantly in recent weeks.
Mike Crooks from Elders says quality issues need to be addressed to lure buyers back.
"We've got a lot of tender wool and old wool coming onto the market as a percentage of the overall catalogue and countries, other than China, are really not in there going like we know they can be," he said.
