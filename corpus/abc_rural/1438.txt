Animal welfare kit well-received: Dairy Australia
Dairy Australia says its efforts to address animal welfare have been well-received.
The peak body has worked with the RSPCA and Animals Australia to develop an animal welfare kit.
Spokeswoman Brigid Peachey says the kit discusses contentious issues, including the handling of bobby calves, dehorning and tail docking.
"What the kit's about is to let farmers know that they're doing on farm is already good animal welfare in terms of on-farm husbandry," she said.
"What we are hoping it's doing is giving them the words to go out there, and talk to people about animal welfare and what they are doing in terms of just their good on farm practices.
