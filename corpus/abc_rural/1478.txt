Gold production hits lowest level in a decade
Despite record high prices this year, gold production in Australia has dropped to its lowest level in 10 years.
The latest figures show a fall to 251 tonnes of gold during the past financial year.
Sandra Close from consultants Surbiton Associates says bad weather during the March quarter is largely to blame, while a lack of exploration is also a problem.
"Since the late '90s exploration for gold has gone from about 60 per cent of total mineral exploration expenditure down to around 30 per cent of total mineral exploration expenditure," she said.
