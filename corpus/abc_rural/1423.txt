Survey 'dispels myth' farming harms environment
A wildlife survey in the southern Riverina of New South Wales has found more than 300 unusual and endangered animals living on irrigation properties.
Irrigators instigated the survey across more than 1 million hectares of the Murray River catchment.
Albury-based ecologist Matthew Herring says the findings dispel the perception that farming is bad for the environment.
"There was some really exciting species found like the little gilberts whistler that you get in red gum areas where there's a dense understorey," he said.
