Wool growers plan ethical wool brand launch
A group of wool growers is planning to launch an ethical wool brand to try to capitalise on consumer demand for environmentally and humanely grown products.
The Australian Wool Growers Association says new branding and marketing innovations are needed to help lift low wool prices and stop the loss of growers from the industry.
Director Will Crozier wants to see all sectors of the growing, processing and manufacturing chain benefit from the brand.
"Our brokers have been talking to people in China and Italy," he said.
