Fundraising group receives environmental award
A Western Australian fundraising group has been awarded a Golden Gecko for environmental excellence after devising a method to recycle black PVC pipe from mine sites.
It is estimated there are tens of thousands of tonnes of discarded black poly pipe lying around outback mining sites in WA.
Tony Fitz-Gibbon from Ruggies Recycling says the success of the project hinges on transport companies giving their services for free.
"The key to the actual process is the machine that goes out there can be taken out on site and can chop the pipe up into a shredded size, and then we put it in bulker bags and then it is brought back by the transport companies on free backloads," he said.
"In Perth, the actual material is then washed and reprocessed, and granulated, and is then made into either new poly pipe.
"Also we can coat the CCA treated pine logs and make posts for vineyards and that sort of thing with the recycled poly."
