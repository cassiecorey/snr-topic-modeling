Cow excema outbreak poses threat
There has been an outbreak of potentially deadly facial excema in several cow herds in eastern Victoria.
Sunburn on teats is the first sign of the disease, which is caused by fungal toxins in damp pastures.
Gippsland vet Jack Winterbottom says if left untreated there could be a major outbreak.
"We'd have dead cows, at the very least you'd have cows that would be very hard to manage in terms of being irritable perhaps not wanting to be milked, be very reluctant to have units put on teats," he said.
