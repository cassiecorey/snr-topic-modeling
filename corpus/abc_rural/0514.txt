NFF contender seeks to build trust between cities and bush
The man widely tipped to be the next head of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) says his main priority will be rebuilding trust between urban and country areas.
The former chairman of Meat and Livestock Australia David Crombie, has been asked to run for the NFF presidency by two state farming groups.
He says farmers need the support of city people to defeat extreme animal rights groups, which he says is a key issue for Australian agriculture.
Mr Crombie, who lives in Brisbane, says he is not a typical farmer, but does not think that stops him being an effective leader of Australia's most powerful rural lobby group.
"No, I'm certainly not an average farmer because I currently live in Brisbane, but certainly my interests are in agriculture and all of my professional life I've been involved in agriculture. I believe I have something to offer. I believe I can make a difference," he said.
