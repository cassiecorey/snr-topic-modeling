Wool growers unenthusiastic about shearers' proposed wage rise
Wool growers say they are not keen to support a proposed 4 per cent increase to shearers' wages.
The Shearers and Rural Workers Union says it has recommended "modest" new rates, with a $9 increase per 100 sheep.
Growers will be asked to sign common law agreements to pay the new rates from October 31.
But the executive director of WoolProducers, Greg Weller, says growers need to remember that the rise is not set in concrete.
"They're entitled to be able to put forward a view to their members on what they believe should be the appropriate rate," he said.
"And I don't think it's helpful for either shearers, and particularly wool growers, if there's a suggestion that there is some rate out there other than what's actually in the award.
