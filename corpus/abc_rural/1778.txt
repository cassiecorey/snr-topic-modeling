Rural doctors push for fly-in, fly-out mental health workers
The Rural Doctors Association of Australia says the federal and state governments need to fund fly-in, fly-out mental health workers to deal with a major shortage in regional and remote areas.
It says the Federal Government's announcement yesterday that it is expanding access to mental health staff under Medicare and setting up new rural clinics will not work if staff can not be persuaded to go to the bush.
Association president Dr Ross Maxwell says while more psychologists and psychiatrists need to be trained, it still would not be enough to fix the rural shortfall.
