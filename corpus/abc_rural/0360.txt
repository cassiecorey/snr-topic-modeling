Hydro sale inquiry calls grow
Pressure is mounting on the New South Wales Government to hold a public inquiry into plans to privatise Snowy Hydro.
A big meeting of irrigators in southern New South Wales has called for legislation to guarantee their access to water.
The meeting of 200 irrigators in Griffith last night follows a fiery gatherting of 300 people in Cooma last week.
Irrigators are seeking a guarantee that minimum releases to the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers, covered by the Snowy water agreement, will be legislated.
They are also calling for a 10 per cent cap on individual shareholdings.
A former Snowy Hydro commissioner, Vin Good, urged people to oppose the sale.
"This Australian heritage icon should be kept in Government ownership forever," he said.
With harvest drawing to a close, up to 3 per cent of wine grapes will be left unpicked this year, due to oversupply.
The national vintage is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, just 1 per cent down on last season.
