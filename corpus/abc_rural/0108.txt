Farmers expecting conditions to worsen
Confidence in rural Australia remains weak, with more farmers expecting conditions to worsen over the next 12 months.
The latest quarterly rural confidence survey from Rabobank has found only a quarter of primary producers expect the agricultural economy to improve.
Rabobank's Neil Dobbin says farmers are particularly cautious in the lead-up to the winter cropping system, with many farmers in the eastern states waiting for rain.
"Across Australia the confidence was weaker. It's mainly what they're thinking about in the future, what they see commodity prices and input costs," he said.
