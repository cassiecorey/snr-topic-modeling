Fruit picking not for everyone, says grower
Single parents, the long-term unemployed, older people and some disability pensioners could all be forced to pick fruit under the Federal Government's new welfare-to-work program.
Under the guidelines, anyone living within 90 minutes of a harvest area can be eligible for fruit picking.
Victorian grower Michael Tripodi says extra workers are welcome, but not everyone is cut out for the job.
"To come out on an orchard we have to see value for money in our employees also. It's a bit hard for us to put someone on that won't work as hard as we expect them to work," he said.
"We're starting at daybreak and we'll probably try and push through until two o'clock, once it gets to 40, 42-43 degrees it's bloody hot up here.
