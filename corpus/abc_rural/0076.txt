Tas push to maintain freight subsidy
Tasmanian farmers say they will fight to keep the state's $90 million freight equalisation scheme.
The Federal Government is reviewing the scheme, which subsidises the cost of freight and passengers across Bass Strait.
While Tasmania wants the scheme strengthened, parliamentary secretary for finance Richard Colebeck will only say the Government remains committed to freight equalisation of some kind,
"It's recognised pretty generally that the method of freighting and even operations on Bass Strait have changed significantly over the last 30 years," Mr Colebeck said.
