ACCC clamps down on misleading labels
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is clamping down on misleading claims being made about food and drink.
It has published new guidelines on what can be labelled organic, free range, natural and fresh.
Commissioner John Martin says producers and processors of everything from eggs to fruit juice are increasingly flouting the law but will not be able to get away with it for long.
