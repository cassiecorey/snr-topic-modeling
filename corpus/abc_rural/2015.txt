Sponge cake cook-off whips up competition
The men of north-west Tasmania have proved a dab hand in the kitchen, whipping up frenzied competition at a weekend sponge cake cook-off.
Fourteen cooks lined up for the men-only competition at the Ulverstone Show on Saturday.
Entrant Barry Smith says he had a novel way of making sure there was enough air in his cake mixture.
