Green award for horticulture industry
Efforts by the horticulture industry to stop using one of the worst chemicals to affect the ozone layer have been internationally recognised.
The tomato and strawberry industries have phased out the use of methyl bromide.
Australia agriculture has just been given an ozone protection award from the Environment Protection Authority in the US, which Jeff Mcspedden from Ausveg says recognises our clean and green industry.
"There's been some research done on alternatives and that was to use softer chemicals and the other one was to use steam generators to steam the soil, or to use solarisation where they plough it in the hotter climates and let the sun get rid of nematodes and problems in the soil," he said.
