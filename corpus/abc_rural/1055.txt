Farmers set to be compensated for vitamin price fixing
Eligible farmers, feedlotters and feed suppliers are set to be compensated over the vitamin price fixing scandal of the 1990s.
Australia's first class action against a price fixing cartel has been settled with three major pharmaceutical companies agreeing to pay more than $30 million in compensation and more than $10 million in legal fees.
The settlement still needs to be endorsed by the Federal Court.
Lawyer Kim Parker from Maurice Blackburn Cashman says it is a breakthrough case.
"It was issued as a result of a global cartel being exposed in relation to vitamin products manufactured by a number of different vitamin, pharmaceutical companies including Roche, BASF and Aventis," Ms Parker said.
