Water deal will bring benefits, says commission chief
The head of the Murray Darling Basin Commission is defending the impact of the new interstate water trading agreement.
Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia have signed a deal to trade water across state borders, while the Federal Government has signalled its interest in buying water for the environment.
Chief executive Wendy Craik says while there are concerns about the social impact of water being sold out of communities, there are other benefits as well.
"Yes, when water leaves an area often you know there may be an immediate impact and quite often yes they're not positive but often new enterprises arise up in those areas from where the water's gone because people have money that they didn't otherwise have from selling their water entitlement," she said.
