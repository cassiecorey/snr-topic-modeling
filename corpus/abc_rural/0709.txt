Big turnout tipped fo Farmfest
Despite poor seasonal conditions, consumer confidence is strong at one of Queensland's biggest agricultural field days.
Organisers of the three-day Farmfest near Toowoomba say they are on target for about 80,000 visitors, even though the region has had less than 20 millimetres of rain since the start of the year.
Barry Harley says producers are still opening their wallets.
"And although I don't believe there's still too many people rushing in and buying a $200,000 tractor on the site, the orders are very genuine and there is a tag on it when it rains, but some of the smaller items like quad bikes and silos and bits and pieces - huge sales have actually been recorded," he said.
