Qld rainforest fruits producer takes out national award
A Queensland producer who grows native rainforest fruits for gourmet foods has been named Australia's first Rural Woman of the Year.
It is the first time the seven state and territory winners have been in line for a national award and Martha Shepherd, from Eumundi on the Sunshine Coast hinterland, says she couldn't have received a higher accolade.
"It's a tremendous honour to be representing rural women, they're such an amazing group to begin with," she said.
"But also to have the opportunity to represent the award nationally and show how significant it is for the careers and the future of the many rural women.
