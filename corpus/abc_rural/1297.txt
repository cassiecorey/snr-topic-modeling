Abattoir's closure hits lamb prices
Livestock prices in New South Wales have reacted to the closure of the Cowra Abattoir, with lamb prices falling $3 to $4 a head.
An administrator was appointed and the abattoir's operations were shut down yesterday.
Management claims the meatworks had been losing between $30,000 and $50,000 a week.
Chris Grove, from the New South Wales Sheep Meats Council, is concerned that there is one less buyer in the market.
"What it will probably mean will be a downturn in competition," he said.
"One less buyer means less competition but it is just to be hoped that there is enough competition in the market.
"A big problem we are facing in the industry, all the meat industry and the sheep industry, is the reduction in kill capacity.
"Of course this has been made worse by closure of Cowra Abattoir.
