Wool quality and production on agenda of merino conference
Around 900 delegates from across the globe are in Perth today for the World Merino Conference.
Western Australian Farmers Federation spokesman Mike Norton says the latest developments in breeding and innovation, as well as wool quality and production, are on the agenda.
He says it is excellent news to have so many people from around the world to attend a conference in Western Australia.
"You really do get a different perspective of your industry from the speakers as they come around the world on what's happening," he said.
