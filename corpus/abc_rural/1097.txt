Qld mining sector continues to boom
Queensland's mining boom continues to power ahead with the Queensland Government nominating a large parcel of land for future mineral exploration.
Labor Member for Mount Isa Tony McGrady says nearly 3,500 square kilometres will be offered under a tender system for prospective mining companies.
He says they will also get data showing deposits of copper, lead, zinc and silver.
"As a result of the work they now have information on mineral prospectivitiy in an area of land bigger than the ACT," he said.
