GrainCorp's silos closure plan angers farming groups
Anger is mounting among eastern states' farming groups about plans by GrainCorp to close more than 100 grain receival sites.
Some farmers say the decision will force them to travel up to 100 kilometres more to deliver grain.
North-west Victorian farmer Rod Bishop says he will need to purchase another truck to be able to cart grain more efficiently.
And he says others might be left with no choice but to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up on-farm grain storage.
"I personally don't like it that much because you have to market the grain, keep the weevils out and all those issues come into it but you certainly couldn't discount doing it, that's for sure," he said.
GrainCorp chairman Don Taylor says the company will consider keeping the silos open if growers can guarantee supply.
The grain handler has closed most sites which process less than 5,000 tonnes of grain.
Mr Taylor says GrainCorp's also willing to look at selling old infrastructure to farmers but does not think growers will be interested.
