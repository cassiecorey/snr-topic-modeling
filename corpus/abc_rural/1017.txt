Rural property values plateau
Rural property values seem to have finally plateaued after rising by 70 per cent over the past five years.
Elders rural property expert John Peden says the softer market is more a correction than a direct result of drought or lower farm incomes.
With uncertainty over water allocations, Mr Peden says there is less confidence in the irrigation sector, although the beef industry continues to boom.
"There is normally a slowing in sales volume during the winter. We are experiencing that at the present time, possibly a little more than in previous years," he said.
