Flooding
And rain from cyclone Monica is causing the worst floods in living memory in parts of far north Queensland.
Residents from a Cape York Peninsula aboriginal community and at least three families from cattle properties have been airlifted to drier ground.
Glen Shephard from Lilyvale Station, near Princess Charlotte Bay, says he has never seen anything like it
"Wednesday afternoon it started to rain and by about seven o'clock the next morning we'd had seven inches so the water was starting to tickle our toes, sort a thing," he said.
"It came through the house about fourteen or fifteen inches ... had to walk across the airstrip to get over on a bit of high ground.
"It's always a concern about crocs in this country [but] ... I didn't tell the kids that."
Senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology David Alexander says Monica is one of the most perfect cyclone systems he has seen.
He says it is far more dangerous than cyclone Larry which caused massive destruction in far north Queensland last month.
"It's probably the best developed cyclone I have seen in many, many years," he said.
"It's got a perfect circular eye, it's right at the top of a category 5 range, so it's a very, very severe cyclone.
