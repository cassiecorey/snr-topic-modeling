Govt urged to help pay-off wool debt
The wool industry has made a united call on the Federal Government to help pay a $27 million debt owed by its marketing arm, Australian Wool Services (AWS).
AWS has been responsible for a UK-based superannuation fund for former employees since privatisation in 2000, which is costing the company more than $1.2 million a year.
The debt is holding up any possibility of a merger with research group, Australian Wool Innovation.
AWS chairman Barry Walker hopes industry delegates will meet with Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran within weeks.
"We've been trying now for some 20 months with the Government to get this on the agenda and to get recognition of the issue," he said.
