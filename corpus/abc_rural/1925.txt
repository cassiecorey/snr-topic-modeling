Mine to reopen due to surging gold prices
The Bronzewing gold mine in central Western Australia is set to reopen on the back of climbing gold prices.
The mine and its extraction plant and accommodation village have been mothballed for the past three years after being bought for $9 million by View Resources.
Managing director Tim Gooch says the company has secured debt financing and says strong investor support and current market conditions could see the open cut and underground mine operating again within months.
"We've been modelling on around $A800 an ounce," he said.
