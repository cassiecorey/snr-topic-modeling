Satellite tracking collars to track dingoes
Dingoes in southern and western Queensland are being fitted with satellite tracking collars.
The collars are part of a two year research project to help track and contain wild dog numbers.
Leigh Allen from the Department of Natural Resources and Mines says they have targeted three state forests near Roma, Dalby and Morven where baiting is not working.
"This is a research project to understand more about where dogs are coming from, how far they're moving and what the sources of the current problem are," she said.
