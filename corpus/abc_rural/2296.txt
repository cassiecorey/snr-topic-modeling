Gold price continues to climb
The gold price continues to climb on the back of a weaker US dollar and there are even predictions the price could reach $US700 by Christmas.
Gold is once again being touted as the currency of choice on international markets as the US dollar continues to weaken.
Compounding that effect is the global instability generated by Iran's desire to develop nuclear weapons and a move away from the greenback by that country as well as China.
China has announced it will start holding euros in preference to US dollars.
That has brought the bullish prediction out of Canada that gold could go above $US700 within weeks.
