Minister plays down prospect of banana imports
Banana growers and the Federal Agriculture Minister have rejected media reports that Australians will be eating imported bananas within months.
While there have been calls for imports, because of the high price of bananas after Cyclone Larry destroyed the Queensland crop, the Government is standing by local growers.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says an import risk asssessment is currently underway, but previous assessments have ruled out imports.
"We will not be in any way susceptible to the temptation to bring in bananas as a short-term risk," he said.
"We know the damage that that could cause to our industry, which would be even more devastating than Cyclone Larry's effects."
