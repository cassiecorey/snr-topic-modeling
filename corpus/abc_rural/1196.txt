Egg producers to be audited
Victorian egg producers are stepping up their quality assurance campaign, with a new system to ensure consumers get the egg products they pay for.
Egg farmers producing under the HenCare label will be audited to ensure they meet free-range farming, animal welfare and biosecurity standards.
The president of the Victorian Farmers Federation egg group, Meg Parkinson, says the campaign is designed to eliminate suspicion that egg products are often sold under false labels.
"There has always been a push by some people to say that egg farmers don't do things very well and the eggs in the carton are not the ones they say on the label," she said.
