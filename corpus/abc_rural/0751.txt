More sugar cane smut cases under investigation
Queensland authorities are investigating possible new cases of the fungal disease sugar cane smut.
The disease, never before found in eastern Australia, has the potential to reduce cane yields by up to 30 per cent.
It was confirmed on a farm near Childers yesterday and further cases are now suspected in another block on the same property.
Chris Adriaansen, from Queensland's Department of Primary Industries, will not say how many plants are affected, but denies smut is here to stay.
"No, no, absolutely not. It may be that we will find sequentially a number of small infestations over a period of you know it could be 12 months or even possibly longer," he said.
