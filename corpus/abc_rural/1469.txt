Westpac predicts base metals price drops
In the mining sector the shine is coming off the price of base metals, with forecaster Westpac predicting a 35 per cent drop by the end of the year.
Mining company Consolidated Minerals is blaming a major slump in the price of manganese for a $6 million loss posted yesterday.
Commodity strategist Tobin Gorey says base metal prices are closely aligned to the US economy, which is starting to show signs of slowing down.
"It's been about a consumer spending boom, they've spent a lot of money on a lot of different things, especially houses and so on," he said.
"Those consumers in their houses and in their cars and stuff too, use up a lot of metals, particularly copper and so on, and if that demand slows as it is now, then prices will fall."
