Rural incomes predicted to slump
A major bank is forecasting rural incomes will fall by 60 per cent this financial year.
The National Australia Bank predicts incomes will drop by $4.6 billion from last year to just $3 billion.
But the bank's Jeff Oughton does not believe it will push farmers off the land.
"I don't think a lot of farmers will be leaving the industry, going into this drought we've seen farm property values rise very strongly over the past five years," he said.
