Unsold sheep to be taken to the tip
Sheep could be buried in a pit if they are not sold at a South Australian livestock market.
Prices for older sheep are plummeting in the saleyards, with a lack of buyers during the drought.
One of the state's biggest saleyards, Naracoorte, has drawn up contingency plans. Any unsold sheep will be placed in a pit at the local tip.
Denis Hovenden from the Naracoorte Lucindale Council says stock agents and the council are trying to prevent unsaleable sheep from coming into the yards. But under the current regulations, stock cannot be returned to their owners if they are not sold.
He says no one wants to put the plan into action, but there is very little choice.
"At this stage it is very much an unknown," he said.
