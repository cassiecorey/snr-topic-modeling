Ugly sheep could save wool industry
The search is on for the ugliest merino lambs, because they could save Australia's billion dollar wool industry.
Scientists from the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) and the University of Adelaide are looking for sheep with 'unusual wool', saying they hold the key to improving the genetic quality of merino wool.
Professor Phil Hynd from the University of Adelaide says lambs are usually culled because they have uneven wool, no crimp or bare patches.
He says studying the lambs will help them identify genes which affect wool production.
"We've already got about half a dozen animals that producers provided us with and man, they're the weirdest looking mob of sheep that you've ever seen in your life," he said.
"They're quite embarrassing really, even the sheep look embarrassed.
