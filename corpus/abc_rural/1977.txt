Muster slows cane toads' progress
More than 48,000 cane toads have been caught in the Timber Creek region of the Northern Territory.
A month-long campaign has been running in an attempt to stop the poisonous pest crossing the Western Australian border.
Coordinator Graeme Sawyer originally expected to catch around 10,000 but he is hopeful the Great Toad Muster has slowed the toad's progress.
