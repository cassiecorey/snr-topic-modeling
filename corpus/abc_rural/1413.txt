AWI values benefits to growers at $417m
Peak body Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) says it has delivered $417 million in benefits to woolgrowers over the past three years.
That is according to an independent assessment of the research and development organisation, which has been released as growers prepare to vote on future levy payments.
The report says AWI has established more than 50 direct business relationships to market Australian wool.
Chief executive Len Stephens says those relationships are the future of the sector.
"This week I'll be in Shanghai and Hong Kong with our textile team and we'll be talking to 40 international retailers and showing them what we call our innovation collection for next year," he said.
"In the textile area, I think we've changed our business model to what it was three years ago.
"I'm feeling very confident that that model will work and will produce improved demand for wool over the next couple of years."
