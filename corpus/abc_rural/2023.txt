NT fruit growers bemoan lost Cup sales
Northern Territory fruit growers are hoping to have better luck on the horses today after missing out on lucrative sales for the Cup carnival.
The star fruit, also known as carambola, commands up to $60 a tray at this time of year.
That is more than double the price received outside of the racing calendar.
Darwin growers like Cheryl are hoping to get the crop back on track for Christmas.
"It's used a lot in garnishes and in salads," she said.
"We had a problem earlier on in the year with late rains, early cool temperatures and it just delayed everything - we are about three weeks late with the season for this time of year.
