US Democrats tipped to push for animal ID system
Tthe new-look US Congress is expected to push for mandatory country of origin meat labelling and an animal identification system next year.
Democrats newly-elected to the majority will take the lead in writing the next US Farm Bill.
And Colin Woodall with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association says livestock issues will be key.
"Including country of origin labelling [and] a ban on packer ownership," he said.
"As far as animal ID, we think that also is going to come up."
Meat and Livestock Australia has consistently opposed mandatory labelling for ground beef, which could burden US processors and retailers with costs so high they would reject imported product.
