Vegie growers told to change
Tasmania's vegetable growers have been told to change or be prepared to go out of business.
A strategic plan has been released for the sector, raising a number of areas to be addressed, like improved marketing and better relationships with food processors.
Consultant Euan Laird, who helped produce the report, says the changes will see some growers leave the industry.
"Only the strong will survive," he said.
"It's a really tough market out there and those that change and adapt, and modify, and meet the demands of consumers will survive so I'll put an estimate that only 50 to 60 per cent of existing growers will survive in the long term and they are going to be those that are adaptable."
Tasmania's growers agree with the plan but most feel the hard work is still ahead.
"We've got to start somewhere to get the vegetable industry off the ground or to stop it going back into the ground I suppose," one grower said.
