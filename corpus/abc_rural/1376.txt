Domestic violence support 'hard to access' for migrants
A Victorian report has found migrant women in country areas are having trouble getting help to deal with domestic violence.
Across Australia one in every three to four families are affected by domestic violence.
The report says country women in particularly find it difficult to access support services.
Diana Orlando, from the Immigrant Women's Domestic Violence Service, says it is even harder for women from non-English speaking backgrounds.
"It's language barrier but it's also trust," she said.
"What the community said in the report was is it a service that's going to understand me, understand my culture, am I just going to be pressured to leave and break the family?
"I can't leave because I'm on a farm or I can't leave because I'm being threatened with deportation.
