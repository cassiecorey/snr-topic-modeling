Frost devastates Clare Valley vineyards
Another of South Australia's premium wine regions has been devastated by frost.
The Barossa Valley, Coonawarra and Padthway have experienced crop losses ranging from 20 and 90 per cent.
Now the Clare Valley, north of Adelaide, has also been hit.
Trelawney Vineyard manager Tracey Sandow estimates last weekend's big freeze ruined hundreds of tonnes of grapes.
"The frost came in Saturday morning and anything on the low lying areas of the vineyard was basically blackened off completely," she said.
