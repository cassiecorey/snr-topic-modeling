Potato harvesters dig up WWII mortar bomb
A team of potato harvesters in northern Tasmania dug up more than they bargained for at the weekend - a World War II mortar bomb.
Army bomb disposal experts were flown from Melbourne to the Campbell Town farm and declared the rusty three kilogram bomb to be a harmless practice round.
Major Danny Rowe says they are called out to Tasmania on average once a month and only 10 per cent of bombs are found to be live.
"Some of the areas around here were used during the war and post war as practice ranges, for troops that were billeted down in Tasmania, so some of these areas have old ammunition on them that have been fired during the war," he said.
