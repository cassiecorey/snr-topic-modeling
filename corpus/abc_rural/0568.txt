Sexy smells may help trap toads
Bottling up cane toads' sexual odours is the latest left-field idea to trap the noxious pest.
The new research builds on a discovery that the pheromones excreted by a native male frog attracts female frogs at large.
Dr Mike Tyler from the University of Adelaide says they are hoping cane toad smells will have a similar pulling power.
"If it's an attractant we would be able to attract perhaps females in such numbers that instead of having to go around and pick up one here and one there, we might be able to attract them together," he said.
