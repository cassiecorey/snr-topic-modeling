Mine expansion bond not enough: WWF
Traditional owners and conservationists have vowed to continue campaigning against expansion of the Northern Territory's McArthur River lead and zinc mine.
That is despite the Territory Government giving the green light for diversion of the tropical river, to allow mining of one of the world's largest ore deposits beneath the river bed.
Dr Stuart Blanch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says the $55 million bond will not be enough to safeguard the Gulf of Carpentaria.
"What can it do if there is major pollution spill into the McArthur?" he said.
"I have never heard any reasonable technical or engineering proposal that would say for $55.5 million or in that ballpark, this is how we can recapture lead and zinc or other acid or heavy metals that are escaped into the river that have been absorbed by fish or dugong, or turtle and polluted the sediment.
