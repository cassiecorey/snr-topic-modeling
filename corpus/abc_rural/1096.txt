US to scale back mad cow disease testing
United States Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says his department will scale back its expanded testing for mad cow disease due to its extremely low rates.
Mr Johanns says years of expanded and normal testing shows the US is likely to have four to seven infected animals and reducing current testing almost ten-fold to 40,000 a year is still well above international guidelines.
Mr Johanns dismisses concerns the move will cause a new rift with Japan, whose food safety body wants continued high US testing.
"We have bent over backwards with the Japanese, we've even agreed with them to ship only beef from animals under 20-months and that's a very unique, very, very unusual agreement," he said.
