US producers weary of resumption in Japan trading
Cattle producers in the United States are not hopeful of a quick resumption of their beef trade to Japan, despite a successful tour of US meat plants by Japanese inspectors.
The beef trade is awaiting confirmation that US beef will again be allowed into Japan after a two-year bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-related ban.
The ban was lifted late last year but reimposed after early shipments were found to contain traces of spinal cord.
Jay Truitt, from the National Cattlemens Beef Association, thinks many producers and processors might not want to supply Japan again.
"I think there's some excitement, obviously, it's tempered, because history has been a good teacher for us, that we shouldn't get too excited," he said.
"More importantly though, from our perspective, is that we really look at our industry and we begin to now look sincerely at what are the opportunities for us in Japan and they're still quite limited and we're not going to over prepare for it, it's an expensive market for us to function.
