Scientists successfully grow southern bluefin tuna cell cultures
In a world first, South Australian scientists have grown cell cultures of the southern bluefin tuna.
Flinders University and the CSIRO have grown the cells so they can experiment with antioxidants to extend the shelf life of tuna and test for viruses.
Dr Kathy Schuller from Flinders University says it is much cheaper than using live tuna worth $50 a kilogram.
"We can test 24 different concentrations and combinations of antioxidants at a time," she said.
