Growers back forest biofuels industry development
A national group representing commercial and private forest growers has thrown its support behind the development of a forest biofuels industry.
Australian Forest Growers is holding its international conference in Launceston this week and the association's president, David Geddes, says such an industry could be an opportunity for drought-affected farmers.
He says trees are less susceptible to drought than other crops and the wood thinnings would be a valuable source of biofuel.
