Oil price tipped to boost wool market
The biggest buyer of Australian wool says high oil prices should help to drive up the wool market by another 10 per cent before Christmas.
Growers saw an early jump in prices in the first few months of this year but the market has remained fairly stagnant ever since.
Soaring oil prices have forced up the cost of synthetics, leading to more demand for wool.
Chris Kelly, from Chinese wool buyer Itochu, says the impact of the drought and demand from Chinese millers should also lift the market.
"The pipeline is very short, particularly in China and other wool consuming countries as well," he said.
