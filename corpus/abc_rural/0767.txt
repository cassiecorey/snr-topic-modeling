Former wool industry leader backs marketing campaign
A test marketing campaign for wool in the United States is money well spent, according to a former industry leader.
Former senior executive of Wool International Bob Richardson has defended the joint venture with Saks of Fifth Avenue and retailer Dillards.
He says the initial investment of just $6 million will be recouped by growers several times.
Mr Richardson rejects the assertion made by consultant Graham Lean that money spent on promotion has no impact on wool prices.
"Absolutely I do. It is just so simplistic to think that just because there is not that correlation that therefore promotion of wool has not been successful in the past," he said.
