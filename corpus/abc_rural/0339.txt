Cazaly court action chances 'relatively slim'
A resources analyst says a Federal Court bid over the rights to an iron ore tenement in Western Australia's north-west has little chance of success.
Cazaly Resources pegged the large deposit in September when it become clear mining giant Rio Tinto had forgotten to renew its lease.
Mines Minister John Bowler has ruled the land be returned to Rio, resulting in a $75 million loss for Cazaly shareholders on the stock exchange yesterday.
But Hartley's Rob Brierley says Cazaly's court action could be in vain.
