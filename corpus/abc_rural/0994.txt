VFF group calls for restructure
There are calls today for a major restructure of the Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF).
The VFF's livestock group says its membership has fallen from 6,000 to 3,000 and it may no longer be able to afford representation on peak industry bodies like the Sheepmeat Council.
Group president Ailsa Fox says the VFF needs to change the way it allocates its budget.
"There's two ways of dealing with this question, whilst we need more funds, our executive officer identified that there is perhaps resources that could be shared a lot better within the organisation," she said.
