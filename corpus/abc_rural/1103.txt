Fergies flock to flood festival
The heroic feats of the famous grey Ferguson tractor are being celebrated in the New South Wales town of Wentworth this weekend.
The Festival of the Flood will see 300 fergies of all shapes are sizes attending to commemorate massive floods in 1956.
The fergies will be the stars of the show because they were used to build levee banks to stop the rising floodwater and protect the town.
Fergie enthusiast John Reeves from Geelong will be there and can not wait to catch up with others who share his passion.
