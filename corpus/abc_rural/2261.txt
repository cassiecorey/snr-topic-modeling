Plantation timber companies offer agistment, water access to farmers
Plantation timber companies are opening their gates to assist farmers in drought-stricken areas, offering cheap agistment and access to stored water.
Across southern South Australia and western Victoria, bluegum plantation company Timbercorp is allowing farmers to pump water from dams to water livestock.
And Great Southern Plantations has offered lower rates for agisting sheep amid its bluegums.
Spokesman David Ikin says the company benefits as well.
"The sheep feed on grasses and so forth that are growing between the trees keeping down the undergrowth," he said.
"[It is] obviously from the farmers' point of view, a valuable source of feed through what's been a tough time.
"We've got about 30,000 sheep altogether now grazing on our properties.
