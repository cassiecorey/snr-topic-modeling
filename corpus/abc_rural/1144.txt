Livestock transporter wants more rationalisation
There are calls today for more rationalisation and enforcement of legislation in the livestock transport sector.
Jim Cooper is the departing owner of the nation's largest livestock trucking fleet, Road Trains of Australia.
He has just sold his livestock fleet to another operator and believes it was a necessary step.
Mr Cooper will keep his other transport business and concentrate on the growing resources sector.
"The way the mining sector's regulated ... yes we can work within the legislation and compliance within the mining industry," he said.
"I certainly see some of the services for the remote area cattle haulage pulling back. I think a lot of the road trains, whether they are RTA or Hampton's, operate very much like a taxi rank.
