Pool arrangements 'don't secure' growers
The Grains Council of Australia says new trust arrangements for the national pool, which make AWB Limited the sole beneficiary of the trust, will not protect the financial interests of growers.
AWB National Pool Trust Pty Limited has been set up to quarantine the liabilities of each pool within that national pool, starting with this financial year.
But Grains Council chairman Murray Jones says the arrangement does nothing to change the status of growers from unsecured to secured creditors.
"Our legal advice is telling us that because they've made AWB Limited a beneficiary of the trust then that doesn't really achieve what we aimed to do, which was to ensure the growers and the pool participants were the secured creditors," he said.
"Growers today are really focussed on how serious the drought is. They are really doing it tough, and we need to do whatever we can to preserve their equity in this current pool."
But the chairman of AWB International, Ian Donges, says the Grains Council has got it all wrong about the new trust.
He says growers will enjoy more financial security, not less.
"The reason we went down the trust path is that we wanted to give pool participants additional protection against any unforeseen liabilities," he said.
