Summit dispels perception of plentiful northern water
A Darwin summit on water resources in northern Australia has been told there is not an abundance of water to support development.
Tropical rivers make up 70 per cent of Australia's freshwater and there has been debate about whether southern farmers should be moving north to escape drought.
But the Northern Territory's Environment Minister, Marion Scrymgour, says the common perceptions are wrong.
"We need to focus on that we have severe rainfall for five months of the year and then plan for the other seven months of the year when there is no rain," she said.
"And we have seen the patterns over the last five years, where we have had a reduction in those rainfall patterns."
"So we can't become complacent, we have to change those attitudes and we have to work together about how do we better educate the communities.
