Ethanol producer welcomes mandate plan
Australia's largest ethanol producer is urging the Federal Government to follow New South Wales' decision to mandate the use of 10 per cent ethanol-blended petrol by 2011.
Premier Morris Iemma says the transition could lower fuel prices, reduce greenhouse gases and provide jobs in regional areas.
Manildra Group director Caroline Honan says the Federal Government must follow.
"As part of the ethanol industry we would like to congratulate the Premier on the announcement," he said.
"It is certainly a very positive for the ethanol industry.
"I think certainly the Premier has paved the way in terms of state legislation and we would like to see the Federal Government also move towards a mandate as well.
