Mahogony timber harvest headed for floorboarding
The first commercial timber harvest from far north Western Australia is destined to be floorboarding for Perth's housing boom.
Indian sandalwood was supposed to be grown in the Ord River pilot project, but the trees were taken over by african mahogany, with 300 hectares now harvested.
Max Correy from the Kimberley Timber Company says the mahogany trees seem to enjoy the irrigated growing conditions.
"All the other mahogany plantations, which have more or less been trial plantations are all dry-land," he said.
"And of course they are looking at two to two and a half, maybe three times the growth time frame that we are.
