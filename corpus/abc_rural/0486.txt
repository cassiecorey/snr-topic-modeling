Rural property values tipped to even out
Rural property values have doubled and in some cases tripled in just four years, outperforming most other capital investments.
But they could be about to come off the boil.
Wayne Carlson from the National Australia Bank says prices are expected to even out in the next 12 to 24 months.
"We probably don't really expect prices to come down," he said.
"We expect more a plateau effect.
"These may be some discount in the lower, standard and marginal type lends. And there's no doubt the trend of this off-farm investment super funds, managed investment schemes et cetera will continue to tip money into this market.
