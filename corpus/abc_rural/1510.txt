River pumping allowed in Bourke
The New South Wales Government has allowed horticultural irrigators in the outback community of Bourke to pump emergency water supplies out of the dwindling Darling River.
The Bourke region has been suffering drought conditions for more than five years, and irrigators are battling to keep citrus trees, grape vines and hojoba plants alive.
Phil Mansell from Back of Bourke Fruits says tough decision are being made about whether to let crops die, with no guarantee of future water flows.
"We have a grape crop there that we have to now make the decision, will we have the water to take that crop through into a harvest?" he said.
"It's a further million dollar investment to do the work to grow that crop, and the easiest thing to do is just to turn the water off a significantly large area of vines.
"But the financiers are facing a terrible dilemma, they are considering what does that do to the community, what does it do to jobs in town et cetera?"
