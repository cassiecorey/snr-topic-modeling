Wool prices up
Wool prices have ended on a positive note at the final Sydney auctions for 2006. 
   
The northern wool market indicator has finished on 858 cents a kilo, up 11 cents on last week.
The last sales for the year are being held in Melbourne and Fremantle today, and wool broker Don MacDonald expects prices to stay firm.
"Yes I would think so, supply is now the main issue and I can't see any way the market will flag off today," he said.
