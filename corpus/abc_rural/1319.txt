Tas apple producers seek new Japanese export protocol
Tasmanian apple growers are pinning their hopes on a new export protocol to save their export market to Japan.
The industry has spent eight years pioneering the trade, but despite years of research, the fumigation of fruit for codling moth has continued to cause significant internal fruit damage.
Fruit exporter Ken Bell says the industry is not likely to resume the trade until a new protocol can be agreed to.
"Generally, the industry feel a little bit despondent with the Japanese market because we've worked for years and years and it's cost a lot of money as you say, a lot of heartache,"he said.
