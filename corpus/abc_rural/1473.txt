Australia endures driest August since 1900
On this first day of spring there is little surprise at news Australia has endured its driest August since records began in 1900.
Preliminary figures show a national average rainfall of just 6.87 millimetres for August.
Overall, an average of 43.9 millimetres of rain fell across Australia during the winter.
Senior climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, Dr Andrew Watkins, says it has been decades since rain was so scarce.
"Australia-wide we only averaged about 6.2 millimetres for the month, so a very dry month," he said.
"Our previous driest Augusts were in 1914 and unfortunately 1982 is also a comparison - it had about 7.5 millimetres.
