Landmark to slash 50 jobs
One of Australia's largest wool brokers and rural services companies, Landmark, is to axe 50 jobs across Australia as drought conditions and water shortages bite further into the bottom lines of agribusinesses.
Its parent company, AWB, is also reviewing costs.
Landmark says 50 staff will lose their jobs across its offices in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.
Company spokesman Peter McBride says a high-cost base and the tough seasonal outlook has forced the company to cut 2.5 per cent of it work force, including back office and shop staff.
"While grain, sheep and livestock are affected, merchandise, fertiliser is also affected," he said.
"Landmark is still a very strong rural business that from time to time, just like any other business, we have to make some tough decision."
