Tassie team takes out shearing championships
In just its third year of competing, Tasmania has won the team's event at the national shearing championships, in Hay, NSW, at the weekend.
The Tasmanians took out the trophy at Hay on the weekend, beating Western Australia by more than 30 points.
Team member Steve Rigby says the island state's success is remarkable, given its inexperience.
"Just three years up and running and to beat you know the other states of Australia that have been competing for a lot longer than we have ... it's a real surprise," he said.
"Not only have we got some of the best wool in Australia we've got the some of the best shearers and shed hands."
