Flower growers surprised at banned-seed list
Cut-flower growers are calling for more time to comment on draft changes to seed import regulations.
For the past two months, Biosecurity Australia has been reviewing the Permitted Seeds List.
But tropical flower growers, like Alan Carle, say the review has caught many growers by surprise.
"We are in a process, a review process to dramatically restrict the number of plants and seeds which may be brought into the country in the future," Mr Carle said.
"Effectively, it slams the door shut. We should all just band together and ask for a moratorium so we have time to consider and work in a constructive way with Biosecurity Australia and Quarantine to come up with a system which we are all happy with and doesn't create some sort of black market.
"I mean that's the worst thing that can happen to this country is to get things brought in without proper controls."
