Rail price dispute may see grain trucked
AWB and GrainCorp say all Queensland grain could have to be transported by road in future because they have not been able to strike a deal on freight rates with Queensland Rail.
The rail company says there has been a verbal agreement for a 12 per cent average increase in freight rates.
But Lachlan Benson, from AWB, says there is no deal and the proposed increases of between 10 and 20 per cent are concerning.
''The proposed rates put forward raise serious concerns with us as to whether rail remains a viable option for growers to export their grain," he said.
"What that actually might mean for the rail network ... [is] you are going to see a large percentage of the harvest transferring to road."
