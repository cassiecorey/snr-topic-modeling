Frost hits SA winter potato crop
The price of potatoes could be set to rise after a large area of the winter crop was wiped out in South Australia's Mallee region.
Growers estimate about 10,000 tonnes of potatoes have been affected by frost and they are expecting stocks to be in short supply later in the year.
Pinnaroo grower Rick Rossitano lost about 4,000 tonnes.
"It's very widespread. It's affected all the spud farmers in the area," he said.
