Company defends GM canola imports
The importer of Australia's first shipment of genetically modified (GM) canola says it had no choice but to buy in grain because of falling domestic production.
Three Greenpeace protesters had been arrested at the Port of Newcastle yesterday as they tried to block 57,000 tonnes of Canadian canola being offloaded.
The grain will be processed in Newcastle and sold to unnamed buyers in the oilseed and biodiesel industries.
Cargill Australia importer Robert Green says crop levels in the eastern states have been dramatically reduced.
"The current industry estimates that the crop's only been an odd 160,000 tonnes in the eastern states, versus an east coast demand of over 500,000 tonnes of seed," he said.
