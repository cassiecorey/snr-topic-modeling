Group seeks Govt help to reduce regional alcohol abuse
A national alcohol rehabilitation group is calling on the Federal Government to help stem the rise of alcohol abuse in regional Australia.
The Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation wants the Government to fund ongoing campaigns in rural areas because the level of injury and death from alcohol are much higher than in the cities.
Foundation chief executive Daryl Smeaton says it does not make sense that $2 billion has been spent on campaigns against illicit drugs, when only 5 per cent of the population use them.
He says for 85 per cent of people, alcohol is their drug of choice.
"We think of a drug problem, we think of cannabis and amphetamines because that's what the Federal Government keeps on telling us," he said.
