NSW producer's cattle sets record price at Ekka
A New South Wales beef producer has had a very successful trip to the Ekka in Brisbane.
After a 12 hour drive from Singleton, in the Hunter Valley, Greg Ball has scored wins in three of the four categories of the lead steer competition at the annual agricultural show.
And the auction of his winning prime cattle, set a record price.
"Twenty-seven dollars a kilo for the champion steer - I think that'd be the most money we've ever received for a steer at a competition and I think some people are claiming it as an Australian record, I don't know," he said.
