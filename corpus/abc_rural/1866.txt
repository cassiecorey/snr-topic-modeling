Cattle, sheep export deaths rise
The numbers of cattle and sheep deaths in export shipments has risen slightly in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period last year.
Department of Agriculture reports tabled in the Senate say cattle deaths rose from 1.3 in 1,000 to 1.4.
Sheep deaths rose from six in 1,000 to eight.
Deaths of goats rose from 11 in 1,000 to 13.
But the federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran, says animal management measures at ports and on live export ships have improved dramatically.
"Especially the inspections at the feedlot and also before the stock board the ship, in transit where there's a requirement for a vet, reporting daily back to AQIS, with the oversight of an experienced stockman, the improved feed and watering systems [and] the best ships in the world," he said.
