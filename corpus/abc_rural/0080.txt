Food prices to soar in cyclone's wake
Food prices could be set to soar in areas of far north Queensland devastated by cyclone Larry.
Trucks which transport fruit and vegetables from the region, usually backload with fresh produce and non-perishables from the state's south.
But with crops destroyed, the cost of carting food into the north is expected to skyrocket.
Les Blennerhassett from Blenners Transport says without assistance, freight costs could increase by 90 per cent.
"If we can't get freight subsidies from the Government our freight rates into north Queensland will double from next week, everything on the shelf's going to go up," he said.
"Every food item that's on the shelf there now from fruit and veg to ice cream back to your Wheatbix, every item that's on there all travels by road and rail.
"Rail do have a percentage of the freight and might be able to travel a little bit cheaper going back empty but they have costs also."
Meanwhile sugar millers in north Queensland are assessing damage caused by the cyclone.
Bundaberg Sugar's Mourilyan, Babinda, South Johnstone and Tableland mills all suffered significant damage.
