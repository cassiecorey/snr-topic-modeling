Cereal crops deteriorate amid dry weather
Cereal and canola crops in New South Wales have started to deteriorate.
Producers are pinning their hopes on a weak rain system due to come through tomorrow, but warmer than normal daytime temperatures are stressing crops.
Callers to ABC Central West this morning say 50 to 100 millimetres is needed within the next two weeks.
"Pretty much on a knifes edge at the moment. Our crops weren't sown until about mi- June. They are looking for rain," one caller said.
"It's very marginal here at the moment. Everything is just struggling. The pasture are going back into the ground and the crops are just sitting there," another said.
"Like the rest of the region, things will begin to deteriorate I should imagine," a listener said.
