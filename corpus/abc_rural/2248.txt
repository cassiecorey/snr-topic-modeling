Dairy Australia appoints drought coordinators to help farmers
Dairy Australia is taking further measures to ensure farmers are looked after during the drought.
In Victoria, local drought coordinators have been appointed to help troubled farmers connect to drought relief and financial services.
Gippsland coordinator John Hutchison says it is another way of farmers helping each other out.
"I think Dairy Australia are trying to be proactive and be seen by the dairy community that they are actually understanding the difficulties that farmers are under," he said.
