NT cattle exports to Malaysia almost double
Almost twice as many cattle are being exported from the Northern Territory to the Malaysian state of Sabah compared to last year.
Almost 2,500 cattle have been sent out of the port of Darwin this year and the trade is expected to keep growing.
Stuart Kenny from the NT Cattlemen's Association has been at the opening a new Meat Technology Centre in Sabah, which he says will help to build the export business.
"We are presently about 30 kilometres north of the main city in Sabah, which has seen a collaborative agreement between Sabah Government and also the NT Government," he said.
"What we are seeing today is a first class facility that can meet the technology and the quality of meat that can be seen anywhere in Australia.
