More work to be done on fresh produce code of conduct
The Federal Government denies it has broken a key election promise for a mandatory code of conduct for the fresh produce sector, despite further delays.
The code, to improve relations between wholesalers and growers, was to have been introduced within 100 days of the last election.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran now admits there is still more work to be done after Cabinet again failed to agree on the plan this week.
He also says statements by former deputy prime minister John Anderson that the code would include the big supermarket chains have been misinterpreted.
"I thought that was quite ambiguous and was a broadening out of his other statements that I've had regard to," he said.
"So it might have been in Mr Anderson's mind to expand it to supermarkets but that would have been policy on the run."
The National Farmers Federation says the Government's 100 day deadline was always unachievable.
Despite wanting the retail sector included originally, vice-president Charles Burke now just wants the policy in place as soon as possible.
