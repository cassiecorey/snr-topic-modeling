Climatologists back farmers on dry weather
Climate modelling from around the world continues to support what farmers have believed for years, that it is getting drier.
Climatologist Dr Ian Foster, from Western Australia's Department of Agriculture and Food, says there has been a shift to a noticeably drier climate in the south-west of Western Australia and that is set to continue for the next century.
He says that trend is now also coming through elsewhere in Australia.
