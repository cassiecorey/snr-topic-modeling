SAFF rejoins National Farmers Federation
South Australia's Farmers Federation (SAFF) is rejoining the national farming body.
SAFF withdrew its membership from the National Farmers Federation (NFF) three years ago because it could not afford the fees.
The NFF has negotiated a discounted rate to South Australia for the next two years.
SAFF's Carol Vincent says her organisation could not continue being independent from the national body.
"I don't think it was affordable for the SAFF any more not to be a be a member of the NFF. Farming organisations can't afford for the future to be in competition with one another they have to be working together, we think the future needs strong national representation as well as strong state representation," she said.
NFF chief executive Ben Fargher says the move will strengthen farmers' influence in Canberra.
"To be frank it does hurt NFF's credibility if state farm organisations are not members, so it is great that SAFF is coming back," he said.
