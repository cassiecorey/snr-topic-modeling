Recent frost hit vineyards
Wine grape growers in Victoria's high country say their vineyards have been badly damaged by recent severe frost.
The frost, which caused widespread devastation in orchards in the Goulburn Valley, also hit the state's east.
Gippsland wine grape growers Howard Reddish says he has lost at least 50 per cent of his grapes but it is hard to know the true cost of the damage just yet.
"We're going to have to do something to the vines now to remove the dead and unwanted shoots," he said.
