Sheep producers urged to offload stock
Sheep producers in Western Australia are being urged to get rid of stock as soon as possible, because the seasonal indicators show the season is not going to improve.
With ongoing dry weather, stock numbers are already down between 25 and 50 per cent in the northern zone, but with a lack of feed, authorities say more will have to go.
Tim Wiley from the Department of Agriculture and Food says if farmers hold off too much longer, they will have to shoot stock, because it will be too expensive to get them ready for market.
"The earlier you reduce stock numbers, the less stock you'll have to get rid of," he said.
