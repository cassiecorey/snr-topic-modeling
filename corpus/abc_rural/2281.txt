Core cattle breeding stock numbers fall
The New South Wales Opposition says core cattle breeding stock levels have fallen by 65 per cent due to the drought.
Opposition primary industries spokesman Duncan Gay claims it could take five years to rebuild stock levels.
North-west stock agent Dick Cameron says some producers have already lost all of their breeding stock and may never recover.
"Some people have run out of heart, some have run out of money and some have run out of both," he said.
