Tribunal rejects call for southern bluefin tuna ban
A conservation group's attempt to ban the export of southern bluefin tuna from Port Lincoln in South Australia has failed.
The Humane Society International (HSI) put a case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for tuna exports to be banned because it believes the species is endangered.
But after three years of public consultation, the tribunal has upheld the Federal Government's decision to allow exports to continue.
Tuna Boat Owners Association president Brian Jeffriess says no-one else agreed that tuna was at risk.
"The court didn't think so, the Minister didn't think so, the public process didn't think so," he said.
