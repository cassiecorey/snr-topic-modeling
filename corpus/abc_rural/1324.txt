Farmers urged to assess greenhouse gas emissions
Farmers are being warned to start assessing their carbon emissions, even though a new state-based carbon trading scheme does not include agriculture yet.
States including Victoria and New South Wales have launched a plan to establish emission targets and a trading scheme for electricity generators.
Tracie Griffin from the Victorian Government's Greenhouse in Agriculture Program says farmers are the second highest greenhouse gas polluters.
