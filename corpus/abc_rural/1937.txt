Nickel mining reveals promising results
Underground miners at Australia's newest nickel mine have intersected the first of a number of a high grade nickel sulphide ore bodies.
The Flying Fox mine at Forestania, 400 kilometres east of Perth, hosts one of the highest grade nickel deposits in the world.
The price of nickel is currently at a record high.
Western Areas NL managing director Julian Hanna says it is just the beginning of a long-term nickel operation.
"Initially that ore will be toll treated at a nearby treatment plant to produce a nickel concentrate which will end up being exported to Canada," he said.
