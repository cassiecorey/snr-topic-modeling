Riverland grape growers seek compo
The Riverland Wine Grape Growers Association wants a partial compensation package from the Federal Government.
It says the assistance drop uncontracted grapes on the ground, avoiding the need for them to sell fruit to wineries at low prices and contribute to the national oversupply.
Executive officer Chris Byrne says the money could come from the Wine Equalisation Tax.
"That would go a long way towards compensating growers not to sell their fruit at 100 or 200 dollars a tonne," he said.
