Cattle sale under way in freezing conditions
Cattle buyers from across Australia are braving freezing conditions in Bothwell in Tasmania, where 5,500 weaners are going under the hammer.
It is the largest single cattle sale in southern Australia, with buyers from South Australia and New South Wales.
Chris Taylor from Roberts Limited says prices are expected to be high but that will not deter interstate buyers.
"The mainlanders that have come to this sale over the years have been happy to pay what's considered as a premium price," he said.
