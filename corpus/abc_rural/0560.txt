AWB earnings
Despite a rocky few months, AWB is expected to post good half year earnings this week on the back of a solid wheat harvest.
Analysts say the recent poor share price is due to speculation about the future of the single desk and not the company's performance.
There are also reports today that a major management shake-up could be announced, although the company is not commenting.
Commsec analyst Grant Saligari says those rumours have not been put to the market.
"There's been nothing flagged to us by the company at this stage that they will, but that's a possibility," he said.
"The underlying results should still be reasonably robust. There's likely to be a number of one-off costs associated with the Cole inquiry, they'll certainly impact the result.
"It's likely to be higher than the originally flagged cost, as long as the inquiry goes on, I guess they'll continue to have those one-offs."
In another development AWB is gaining a foothold in the dairy sector, announcing a deal between its Landmark company and New Zealand processor Fonterra.
