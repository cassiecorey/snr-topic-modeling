SA dams fill for first time in decade
There has been good rain across South Australia over the past few days, boosting soil moisture levels.
One farmer says his dams have filled for the first time in a decade, with more than a hundred millimetres of rain falling.
Julian Baillie near Tumby Bay on the Eyre Peninsula says it has come as a surprise.
"I sort of did a lap around earlier in the day and a lot of them which haven't had any water in them for the best part of 10 years or even more some of them," Mr Baillie said.
