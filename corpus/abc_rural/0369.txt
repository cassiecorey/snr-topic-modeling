Veg prices increase not flowing through to farmers
New figures show vegetables are costing 15 per cent more than at this time last year.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the cost of food overall jumped more than 4 per cent last quarter due to a hot summer and higher costs for inputs like fuel and packaging.
Mike Badcock from vegetable grower group AUSVEG says despite the rises, farmers are not seeing any increase in their profits.
"The very hot summer that eastern Australia experienced this year really affected production, it basically cooked the product in the ground and it wasn't suitable so there's been some quite large shortages of product - that's the reason prices have gone up," he said.
"The two major supermarket chains control about 76 per cent of the market, they've never had so much market share and they're becoming quite aggressive on what prices they pay for product.
