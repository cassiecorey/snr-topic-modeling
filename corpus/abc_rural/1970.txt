Quarantined US beef released in Japan
Customs officials in Japan have finally released 910 tonnes of US beef which has been in quarantine since January.
The shipment was delayed when Japan reimposed a ban on US imports.
Meat and Livestock Australia's Glen Feist says the problem now is that the beef only has an eight week shelf life.
"The Japanese consumer is extremely discerning when it comes to quality and freshness of any meat," he said.
"If consumer sentiment obviously is down over there against US beef a food service operator might buy this product and not be able to push it through either.
