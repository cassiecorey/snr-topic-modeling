Campaign spares Guyra horses
More than 100 horses have been granted a reprieve in the Guyra region of New South Wales after a campaign to stop them being sent to the knackery.
The future of the horses had been uncertain after their death and a farmer providing agistment has asked for them to be moved.
Campaign coordinator Bianca Lyne says there are plenty of people who want to help.
"People have called from as far away as Tasmania and I'm actually getting emails even from overseas," she said.
