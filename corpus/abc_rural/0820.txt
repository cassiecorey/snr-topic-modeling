Blue mussel farm set to become Australia's largest
Within five years, South Australia's Wallaroo Blue mussel farm will be the largest in the country.
The business is spending $4.5 million developing its 200 hectare lease in the Spencer Gulf.
New Zealand company Flinders Seafood aims to supply 2,000 tonnes a year of blue mussels to the fresh seafood market.
Company director Bruce Koller says a major part of the expansion will be marketing mussels to Australian consumers.
"In New Zealand we eat about two and a quarter kilograms of mussels per head per year and in Australia it's about one tenth of that," he said.
