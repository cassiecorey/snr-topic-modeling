Life on Mars?
Scientists long have wondered whether life ever existed on Mars.
Liquid water is an important part of the equation. On Earth, all forms of life require water to survive.
Among the planets in our solar system, only Earth has a more hospitable climate than Mars, and some scientists suspect Mars once sheltered primitive, bacteria-like organisms.
Previous missions found evidence the Red Planet at one time boasted ample quantities of water, and the question is whether liquid water is still present.
"As with many discoveries, the possibility that liquid water may be coming to the surface of Mars today poses many questions," the scientists said.
"Where is the water coming from? How is it being maintained in liquid form given the present and most likely past environments? How widespread is the water?"
They also wondered whether the water could be used as a resource for future missions to explore Mars.
The two sites are inside craters in the Terra Sirenum and the Centauri Montes regions of southern Mars.
"The shapes of these deposits are what you would expect to see if the material were carried by flowing water," Michael Malin, lead author of the paper, said.
"They have finger-like branches at the downhill end and easily diverted around small obstacles."
The researchers first reported the discovery of the gullies in 2000, but this is the first time they have revealed the presence of newly deposited material seemingly carried by liquid water.
Last month, NASA said the Mars Global Surveyor mission appeared to be at an end, saying it had lost contact after a decade-long mission in which it mapped the surface of Mars, tracked its climate and searched for evidence of water.
