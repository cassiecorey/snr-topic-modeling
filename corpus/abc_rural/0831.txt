Joyce not budging on biofuels bill
Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce says he will vote against the Federal Government to force changes to a fuel tax bill, which could see farmers get fewer rebates on biodiesel.
He says the bill, being debated today, only allows farmers to get a diesel fuel rebate from major oil companies, and not small biodiesel producers.
