Rock lobster prices hit 5-year high
Prices for rock lobsters in the southern fishing zone have hit a five year high just days after the opening of the season.
Along the South Australian coast from Robe to Port Macdonnell prices range between $40 and $48 a kilogram, nearly $10 higher than this time last year.
Lionel Carrison, from the South East Professional Fishermen's Association, says supplies are low at this time of year, but the high prices are not expected to last.
"I guess everybody was anxious for new supplies," he said.
