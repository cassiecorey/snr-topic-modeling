Machinery demand falls in wake of low grain prices
Low grain prices are being blamed for a big drop off in demand for broadacre tractors and machinery over the past 12 months.
Sales are booming in the sugar, dairy and horticulture sectors for smaller equipment, but Vin Delahunty from the Tractor and Machinery Association says grain farmers are holding off.
"People who are relying on sales into the cropping areas have really struggled," she said.
