Electoral boundary change bad for voters: Anderson
The National Party has accused the Australian Electoral Commission of taking the easy way out, by scrapping the federal seat of Gwydir in northern New South Wales.
With a shift in population, New South Wales is required to lose an electorate to accommodate a new seat in Queensland.
The commission wants to merge the seat of Gwydir with Parkes, which will cover almost half the state.
But the retiring Member for Gwydir, former deputy prime minister John Anderson, says the move is a tragedy for country voters.
"I think it's appallingly bad to see people face the prospect of being in a seat that's over twice the size that it is now which makes it far harder for people to access the local member," he said.
"This means one less country voice in Canberra and a lesser chance still of being represented around the Cabinet table.
