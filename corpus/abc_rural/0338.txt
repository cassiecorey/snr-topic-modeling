Stormy weather causes diamond price drop
The stormy weather across northern Australia is affecting the price of diamonds.
Production at the world's biggest diamond mine, Argyle Diamonds in WA, dropped significantly in the first quarter due to wet weather.
Diamond expert James McGlew says the production drop, along with a rush of diamond buying worldwide, is going to make a sparkler much more expensive.
"I mean over the last three years we've seen average price rises totalling about 60 per cent in price," he said.
