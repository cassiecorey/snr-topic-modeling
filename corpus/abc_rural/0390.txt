Buderim Ginger's domestic sales drop 6pc
Queensland-based Buderim Ginger says the major supermarket's push towards home brands has resulted in its first drop in domestic sales in 15 years.
The company has announced a profit of $536,000 for last year, up 56 per cent.
Exports have grown 10 per cent but chairman John Ruscoe says domestic sales have fallen away by 6 per cent.
"The retailers are clearly trying to position their own house brands where they can at the most desirable places in the store, which means that our products really are competing with that," he said.
