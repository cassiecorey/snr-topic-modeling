Telcos urged to express interest for bush broadband
The Federal Government has called for expressions of interest from telecommunications companies who can provide broadband Internet services to regional areas.
The $1.1 billion Connect Australia package aims to improve services outside the capital cities.
Industry analyst Paul Budde says telcos should not be competing for business, but allocated a region to ensure wider coverage.
"People in regional Australia should not have to pay more for that sort of service than people in metropolitan areas, this is infrastructure this is not luxury, everybody needs it, and therefore it has to be treated as such," he said.
