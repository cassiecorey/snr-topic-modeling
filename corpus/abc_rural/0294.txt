Apple packhouse set for $2m upgrade
Australia's biggest apple packhouse is launching a multi-million dollar upgrade.
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran will unveil the $2 million upgrade of the Batlow Fruit Co-operative in southern NSW which features Australia's first automatic blemish sorting system for apples.
The technology has been imported from New Zealand and second grade fruit is identified electronically and then removed from the premium packing line.
It is expected to increase its efficiency.
The grower-owned co-operative was established in 1922 and produces 6,000 bins of apples each year.
The district's growers are suffering after prices fell last year under the weight of a big crop and imported apple juice.
It is well recognised that the gap between city-slickers and their country cousins is growing.
But farmers are out to restore their image by holding a National Farm Day next month.
Victorian wool producer Debbie Bain says farm gates will be opened to city people to help them better understand decisions made on a working property.
"If we have somebody up here and we are bringing sheep into drench them, why do we give them these chemicals? We're shoving these chemicals down their throats, what for?" she said.
"But when you explain about worm burden and and the detrimental [effect] that worms have on sheep, they'll suddenly understand a little bit more about chemical use in animals."
