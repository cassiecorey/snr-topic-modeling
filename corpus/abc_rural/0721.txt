Aust urged to take more responsibility for uranium waste
Australia has been told it needs to take more responsibility for the waste produced from exporting uranium.
About 40 per cent of the world's uranium stocks can be found in Australia and it is shipped to the US, Japan and Europe for use in nuclear power.
A founder of Greenpeace but now one of the world's main supporters of the nuclear industry, Dr Patrick Moore, says Australia should consider using nuclear power.
But he says the nation must take more responsibility for dealing with nuclear waste.
"I think you wave it goodbye at the dock and wash your hands of any responsibility for what goes on in the world," he said.
