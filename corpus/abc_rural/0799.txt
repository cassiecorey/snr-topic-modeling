Grim outlook for grain production
The continuing drought has worsened Australia's outlook for grain production.
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) has just downgraded its forecast for this season's crop yields, by 11 per cent, since its last forecast in February.
ABARE says the area being sown to wheat, barley and canola has also fallen 6 per cent.
But the bureau's John Hogan says while plantings are down in most states, the outlook is still better this winter than last.
"Last year we actually released our crop report a little bit earlier than this, and were a bit below what we're saying now," he said.
