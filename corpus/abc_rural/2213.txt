AWB to split
AWB is planning to split the company in the wake of the Cole inquiry report.
Chairman Brendan Stewart has also announced he will stand down, once the split is approved by shareholders.
As expected, the embattled wheat exporter has proposed to separate AWB International, which owns the single desk licence and service provider AWB Limited to independent companies.
AWBi will be wholly grower-owned and manage the national pool, while AWBl will be listed on the stock exchange and its services to AWBi will be decided in a new agreement to be voted on by shareholders at a February annual general meeting.
Managing director Gordon Davis will also introduce a new executive team to run the company and AWBl's Mr Stewart will stand down in a bid to improve the company's governance.
Meanwhile, BHP Billiton says an internal review into its involvement in the oil-for-food scandal has exonerated the company.
The mining giant was implicated when the Cole Commission heard that BHP Petroleum had delivered a shipload of wheat to Iraq in 1996, worth millions of dollars.
Chief executive Chip Goodyear says the internal review has reflected the Cole report finding that there is no basis for adverse findings against the company.
"BHP and BHP Billiton acted consistently with the UN sanctions and Australian law," he said.
