Producing, manufacturing costs higher than expected
The costs of manufacturing goods and growing produce have risen higher than expected, adding more weight to a forecast interest rate rise next week.
Theoretically the big price increases for producing bananas, grains, beef, sheep and dairy products should mean a pay rise for farmers.
But the ANZ bank's chief economist Saul Eslake says the jump in producer prices reflects a lack of supply due to weather conditions, higher fuel prices, and interest rates.
"Drought has constrained grain supplies, the long-term reduction in sheep numbers across Australia has been a factor in rising meat prices, rising beef prices are partly due to the very good prices that Australian producers have been getting overseas and sugar prices have roughly trebled," he said.
