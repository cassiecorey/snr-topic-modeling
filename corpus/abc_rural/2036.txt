Mixed reaction to drought aid
There has been a mixed reaction to the Federal Government's announcement of drought aid for small businesses reliant on the farm sector.
Businesses which receive 70 per cent of their income from farms in drought-declared areas will be eligible for income support and interest rate subsidies.
The Australian Grain Harvest Association says it will help contractors struggling to make repayments on machinery.
But spokesman Rob Gribble is now urging the government to help contractors prepare for future droughts, by setting up a version of the Farm Management Deposit (FMD) scheme.
"In the long term what we request from the Federal Government is some sort of FMD facility so we can deposit money in good times and draw them out in bad and hopefully self manage our way through these things," he said.
Farm machinery dealers say they have been unfairly excluded from the new drought assistance package.
Vin Delahunty from the Tractor and Machinery Association says most dealers will not be eligible for aid, because they employ more than 20 people.
"Once again the significant employers in the regional areas, the people who employ the most significant number of skills in those communities, have been left out and to be honest, we don't understand why the Government has taken this action."
Irrigators say they are skeptical of plans to speed up interstate water trading to address critical water shortages in drought-hit states.
The federal and state governments have agreed that interstate buying and selling of permanent water rights will begin on January 1.
But George Warne from Australia's biggest irrigation company, Murray Irrigation, says there is little water available to ease shortages, because farmer allocations are so low.
"I think it was good they got together, but I'm as a bit of a loss to understand how permanent water trading is going to help the drought," he said.
