Country women gather for field day
Almost 150 women made their way to Buntine in the West Australian Wheatbelt for the annual Liebe Women's field day yesterday.
Those who attended say it was a good opportunity to get away from the farm and socialise with other farming women who are also struggling with the dry start to 2006.
"These sorts of days are even more important when you realise you're actually not alone and that everybody's going through the same pain," said Sally Lee from the Wubin district.
