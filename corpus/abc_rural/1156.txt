Govt urged to stop river environmental flows
Water shortages in western Victoria are now so severe that farmers are asking the State Government to halt environmental flows into rivers.
With reservoirs only 7 per cent full, farmers are facing the prospect of no available water to fill house dams and paying to cart the water they need for livestock and crop spraying.
President of the Victorian Farmers Federation Simon Ramsay says if there is not enough rain in August, water for rivers should be re-allocated to farms and homes.
"The 2,859 megalitres that sits under the bulk entitlement for environmental flows would be better used and have a greater impact to provide water for stock and domestic use, if needed, rather than the sort of nil effect it will have flushing down the Wimmera River," he said.
Meanwhile Australia needs five years of average rainfall to rebuild water levels in irrigation storages.
That is the view of Professor Wayne Meyer, chief scientist at the Co-operative Research Centre for Irrigation Futures.
Irrigators have not had full water allocations since 2001 and Professor Meyer says ongoing low rainfall has reduced the amount of water available by a third.
"If you look at the storage situation it will take several years of even average rainfall to get our storages back up to those, for example, that we had at the end of the 90s, early part of 2000," he said.
