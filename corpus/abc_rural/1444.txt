AWB secret clause may cost growers
The wheat export regulator has confirmed that growers could face losses, because of a confidential clause in a contract between the corporate and export arms of AWB.
If the grain handler loses its export monopoly after the oil-for-food Inquiry, AWB Limited could claim damages from the national wheat pool.
The pool is run by AWB International and pays growers for their grain.
The Wheat Export Authority says it has a number of concerns about the contract, which is now being re-negotiated as part of an AWB restructure.
But AWB International chairman Ian Donges denies damages could run to tens of millions of dollars.
"It's a three-year agreement so if you break the agreement in the first year it would be greater than in the last year of the agreement but we are only talking in the end of the day many small numbers of millions of dollars if anything," he said.
"There has been no problems between the two companies in terms of the way this contract has been performing - at AWB International, we have been extremely pleased with the performance of AWB Limited.
"Speculation there is going to be a break in the contract is purely that."
Mr Donges' comments have not reassured the Grains Council of Australia.
Chairman Murray Jones says growers should not be paying for the fee at all and wants AWB to make the service agreement public immediately.
"There shouldn't be a fee that goes back to growers for a separation fee and if there is a break fee then we really need to know what it is," he said.
"We are really calling on AWB to tell us what the service agreement contains, tell us what the break fees may be and any liabilities that the growers may take on."
