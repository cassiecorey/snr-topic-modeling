Boxer Bronco Johnson dies at 78
Australia has lost one of the last true boxing showmen, north Queenslander Don 'Bronco' Johnson, who died this week at the age of 78.
Bronco Johnson earned a reputation throughout Australia for his wild fighting style, his courageous rodeo riding and his Errol Flynn moustache.
In the 1950s and 1960s he led a travelling 10-man boxing and rodeo troupe, taking on all challengers.
Troupe member Harry Grogan says it was a tough way to make a living, but he thoroughly enjoyed working with 'Bronco'.
"Any time he fought he used to get the crowd in because they used to love him, the way he would swing at people and hit them from his knees," he said.
