Irrigators discuss compensation with Premier
New South Wales farmers have met with Premier Morris Iemma to ask for compensation for their cut water allocations.
The Government has slashed carry over water allocations for Murray River irrigators by half.
What water is available will only be given to customers near the major supply channels to reduce evaporation.
Chairman of Southern Riverina Irrigators Ted Hatty says the Government has not offered any immediate help.
"The Premier has said that he will look at what he can do, he said we're talking weeks not months, so I suppose that was a positive," he said.
