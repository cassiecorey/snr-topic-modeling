Sheep chemical declared unsafe
Access to a chemical commonly used to treat flystrike and lice in sheep will be severely restricted after tests showing it is unsafe.
The review of Diazinon was prompted earlier this year after farm workers complained of headaches and in some cases vomiting when using the chemical.
Joan Ashton from the Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority says other chemicals are more costly, but human safety is the priority.
"There's really no way you can mitigate what we think is an unacceptable risk to workers," she said.
"Australia's not the only one looking at Diazinon, there's been a range of reviews that have been going on worldwide and it has progressively been discontinued in other countries, as well, along similar lines and for similar reasons for concern, as we've identified here in Australia."
