AWB attempts to retract Cole inquiry evidence
Tempers have flared at the oil for food inquiry, after wheat exporter AWB tried to keep secret a document that was entered into evidence six months ago.
Exhibit 412, which named Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer, was the subject of a bitter exchange between Commissioner Terence Cole and AWB's lawyers this morning.
The exhibit related to Iraq's claim for compensation over wheat shipments it said were contaminated with iron filings.
In the February 2003 memo, AWB executive Peter Geary described the matter as sensitive and political and that AWB would need to inform Mr Downer.
AWB's lawyers leapt to their feet, demanding the document be removed.
They said it was confidential and part of AWB's Federal Court challenge.
After a heated altercation, Commissioner Cole took an immediate adjournment.
