Live export campaign to improve welfare
Meat and Livestock Australia will fund a million dollar campaign to raise awareness of its efforts to improve animal welfare, particularly in the live export trade.
The campaign will begin in WA in a few weeks before being launched nationally, targetting consumers, metropolitan media and schools.
Tim D'arcy from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association says he hopes it will make the live export industry more transparent as well.
"You know, there are people out there who still don't do the right thing, and we're aware of that," he said.
"And we're trying to, through this process, trying to encourage everybody, to ensure their animal welfare management is of the highest order.
