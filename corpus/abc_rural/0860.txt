Council continues fight for skilled worker visas
The meat processing sector says it has not given up fighting for more skilled worker visas to be processed, despite failing to get a commitment from the Federal Government.
Abattoirs across Australia employ hundreds of foreign workers under the 457 visa program to address labour shortages, but over the past four months the Immigration Department has delayed some applications.
The Australian Meat Industry Council will continue meetings with the Federal Government this week.
The council's Kevin Cottrill says talks so far have addressed allegations that industry is misusing the program:
"There are a lot of allegations and a lot of them are not specifically related to the meat industry, and I think this is one of the difficulties we have at the moment," he said.
"Our discussions with the department generally have been around issues of skill levels that are required. There have been some discussions about pay levels but these issues are really now covered by pay regulations."
