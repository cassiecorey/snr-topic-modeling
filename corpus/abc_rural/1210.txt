AWB announces new chief
The head of Orica Mining Services has been named the new managing director of wheat exporter AWB.
Gordon Davis, 50, will replace Andrew Lindberg, who quit at the height of the oil-for-food inquiry earlier this year.
Mr Davis will be paid $875,000 a year, which is less than Mr Lindberg was receiving.
AWB chairman Brendan Stewart says Mr Davis's role will be to stabilise the company and restore its credibility in the aftermath of the Cole inquiry.
"I'm very conscious of the fact that Gordon should not be in any way, shape or form deemed to have been involved in anything that's gone before us at AWB," he said.
"He is new to the organisation, he is a cleanskin in that sense and we look very much forward to him running the business as it goes forward, and essentially the board, and myself, will be dealing with any issues that come out of the Cole inquiry."
Mr Davis will start his role in mid-September.
Meanwhile the Grains Council has written to federal politicians looking for a guarantee that wheat growers will not be lumped with the costs of the Cole inquiry.
AWB estimates the royal commission into alleged kickbacks to Iraq will cost the company between $18 million and $20 million.
The council says current and future profits from wheat sales should not be used to meet the debt.
