Rural students sought to fill mining job vacancies
The education sector in South Australia will recruit students from rural areas to meet the needs of the state's mining boom.
With concerns over future labour shortages, a new degree in mining engineering will be offered at the University of Adelaide next year.
Inaugural Professor of Mining Geology, Ian Plimer, says the new course will specifically seek students from outside the city.
"We are really targeting students from the rural areas because the mining takes place in the rural areas," he said.
