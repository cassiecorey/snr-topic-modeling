Students showcase environmentally sound projects
School students from New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT are in Canberra for a Youth River Health Conference.
The students have been working on environmental projects in the classroom and will give presentations in the form of music, dance, skits and board games.
Projects range from wildlife habitats to compost systems in playgrounds.
