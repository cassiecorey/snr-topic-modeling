Gwydir to disappear in boundary redistribution
A big campaign in New South Wales to stop the abolition of the federal seat of Gwydir has failed.

Queensland will gain a seat due to a population drift across the border.

"It is a little puzzling. The far west of New South Wales and Gwydir have been disenfranchised.
