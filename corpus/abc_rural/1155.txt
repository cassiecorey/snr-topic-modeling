Ad campaign to highlight abuse of migrant visa program
The union movement has launched a campaign to highlight misuse of the skilled migrant visa program.
Under the 457 program, employers like abattoirs can import skilled workers when they can not be found locally.
Unions have now launched a $300,000 ad campaign highlighting abuses of the scheme and Graeme Bird from the Meat Industry Employees Union says they want action.
