Grain harvest contractors urge drought assistance
Contract grain harvesters want the Federal Government to consider exceptional circumstances drought assistance as they go into another tough season.
The Australian Grain Harvesters Association says some contractors have seen their incomes drop by 50 per cent because of a run of reduced crops in recent years.
Association president Peter Bradley says some members are offloading machinery, while others have had equipment repossessed.
"In the last five years in particular we've been in drought in most states," he said.
"And in Western Australia, it's the first time it's facing its worst drought, and there's very little crop over there at all, and the machinery companies and their finance companies have been being very patient with pretty-much everybody for the last five years.
