Vets urge livestock checks in bushfire regions
Vets are urging farmers in bushfire-affected districts to check their livestock once fires have passed through.
In Victoria's Central Gippsland area, 530 beef cattle, 62 sheep and goats and 120 chickens have been lost.
Department of Primary Industries vet Liz Parker says damage from the fires might not show for some days.
"They can look really bad, they can be covered in black and look terrible, but actually they really don't have much damage at all," she said.
"Other animals can look fine but the burns can be in the respiratory tract and sometimes the evidence of that doesn't come up for a couple of days as well, and they can be really life-threatening and the animals might need to be put to sleep."
