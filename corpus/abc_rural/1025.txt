Investment needed to control buffel grass: expert
Control of the introduced pasture buffel grass is proving a major challenge across central Australian parks.
For the past 12 years, Sydney University students have assisted Finke Gorge National Park rangers, south-west of Alice Springs.
The control work involves hot fires and a new soil sterilant.
An anonymous trust funds the majority of the work, but Professor Lester Burgess from the Faculty of Agriculture says there needs to be continual investment.
The overall program costs $10,000 each year.
"The buffel grass is continuing to increase slowly overall in the park, but I think we have been quite successful in slowing it in some areas, no more than about 50 hectares and we have reasonably good control over a further 250 to 500 hectares," he said.
