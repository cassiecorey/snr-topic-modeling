Pork given a health lift
Researchers in the United States have found a new way for humans to take omega 3 oils, by eating pork or bacon.
While vitamin-enriched plant-based foods have been around for years, the researchers have now bred pigs, which produce the fatty acids normally only found in fish.
Professor Randall Prather from the University of Missouri says he is confident the technology will not have the same problems as cloning procedures previously used in sheep.
"Well we used the cloning procedures so the procedures are the same, and yes sometimes you do get some animals that aren't perfectly normal," he said.
"What you saw with the sheep in the UK was the first generation, and when they had offspring the offspring were normal.
