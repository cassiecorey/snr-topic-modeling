Dry Seasons Advisory Committee activated
With Western Australia struggling through its driest start to winter on record, the State Government has activated its Dry Seasons Advisory Committee.
To be formed this week, the committee will include farm bodies, farm management consultants, rural business and local and state government.
Dexter Davies will again chair the committee, which last operated between 2000 and 2002, and says there are a range of areas to be addressed.
"Identify the worst areas, things like health services, the education services, all the basic services to make sure that we've got enough there and people have got somewhere to turn to very early in the piece," he said.
