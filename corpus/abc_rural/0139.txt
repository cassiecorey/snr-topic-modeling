Jail threat for farmers employing illegal workers
Farmers and business operators who knowingly or recklessly employ illegal workers could go to jail under new laws announced by the Federal Government.
Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone says there are around 46,000 overstayers in Australia, many working illegally to support their stay.
But Senator Vanstone says only employers and labour suppliers who deliberately assist or exploit illegal workers need to fear the laws.
Farmers have been the target of Immigration Department raids, especially fruit and vegetable growers who often struggle to find enough seasonal labour to pick crops.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) says very few growers deliberately employ illegal workers.
And the NFF's Denita Wawn says there is protection in the laws for farmers who unwittingly employ illegals.
