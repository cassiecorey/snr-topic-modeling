Extra funds allocated for Qld sugar industry reform
The Federal Government has announced another $33 million to reform the sugar industry in Queensland.
One of the plans is to generate a third of Mackay's energy needs from nearby cane fields.
Under a $95 million project, the Mackay Sugar Co-operative will transform one its mills to convert sugar cane waste into steam and then electricity.
Chief executive John Pollock says the funding will kickstart the plant.
"We're really pleased that $12 million that the Government have seen the value of the project and we presume that it's funding the early stages of that project rather then the latter stages," he said.
