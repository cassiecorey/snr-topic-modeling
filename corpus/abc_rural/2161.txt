Rising humidity, heat aids croc growth
The rapidly rising humidity and heat in the Northern Territory is proving good news for crocodile farms.
Many are busy grading baby saltwater crocodiles, according to size.
At Noonamah on the outskirts of Darwin, Mick Burns is sorting 12,000 baby reptiles, which are more than one-metre long.
"The animals get very dominant and territorial and they'll blue with any smaller animal," he said.
"No losses of fingers but certainly there would be a few little nips.
"This year has been pretty slow because we have had such a cold dry season, it's the third or fourth largest number of days that have been below a certain temperature so that certainly slows down the animals.
