South Australian wheat bound for Iraq
Another consignment of wheat bound for Iraq will leave Port Giles in South Australia on Wednesday.
Part of the 350,000 tonne Wheat Australia deal, it is the first wheat from South Australia to leave the port for Iraq in almost two years.
ABB Limited's Maggie Dowling says the 23,000 tonne shipment is big news for the state's wheat industry.
