Woodside to spend billion on Vincent oil field
Australia's largest oil company will spend a billion dollars developing the Vincent oil field, off the coast of Exmouth, in north-western Western Australia.
Vincent will produce about a fifth of Woodside Petroleum's annual oil production by the end of 2008.
Hartley's analyst Rob Brierley says Woodside has locked in oil production from Vincent for higher than the current price of crude oil.
"It's a decent oil field," he said.
"They've managed to hedge about 30 per cent of their production. Where they've got oil price locked in between $55 a barrel and $75 a barrel that's pretty healthy margin stuff."
