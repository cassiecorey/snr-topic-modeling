Transport sector calls for better infrastructure
The trucking industry says new laws to reduce driver fatigue must be accompanied by major government spending on roads.
The National Transport Commission has released the final version of its plans to reduce driving hours and increase penalties in a bid to improve safety.
While many concerns with the commission's initial recommendations have been addressed, the transport sector says better infrastructure is needed.
Stuart St Clair from the Australian Trucking Association says drivers can not meet new rest break requirements unless 21,000 new rest areas are built.
"It's very difficult to put an onus on the trucking industry and its drivers to perform to the necessary regulations, that's one thing and we accept that responsibility," he said.
