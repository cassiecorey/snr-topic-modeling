Snowy Hydro foreign ownership cap not enough: rice growers
The Ricegrowers Association of Australia says the cap on foreign ownership of Snowy Hydro is not enough to protect irrigators' interests.
The New South Wales, Victorian and Federal Governments yesterday agreed to permanently limit foreign ownership of the scheme to 35 per cent, with a cap of 15 per cent for individual foreign investors.
But Ricegrowers Association president Laurie Arthur says that would not prevent a large Australian company buying a majority stake.
"It's some recognition that the governments are listening to the concern that have been put to them," he said.
"It doesn't go far enough, we still believe there's the capacity for an Australian company to have undue influence as regards to the licence that control the water and the release of water."
The Murray Darling Basin Commission and the National Farmers Federation are also worried about aspects of the deal.
But federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says regardless of who owns Snowy Hydro, the interests of irrigators are guaranteed in the Snowy water licensing agreement.
"It was developed by the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian Governments at the time of corporatisation specifically to protect security, it guarantees the volumes for irrigators," he said.
