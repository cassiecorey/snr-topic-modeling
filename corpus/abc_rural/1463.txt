CWA calls for country of origin labels
The Country Women's Association (CWA) is calling on shoppers to buy homegrown produce at the supermarket, to help ensure the survival of Australian agriculture.
The 32nd national conference of the CWA has brought more than 100 delegates to Darwin this week.
The new president, Tasmanian Leslie Young, says cheap imports and the drought mean it is time for everybody to work together.
