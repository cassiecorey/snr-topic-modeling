Drought support package extended
The Federal Government has further extended its drought support package.
The Drought Force program, which allows farm employees who have been laid off to receive income support while still working on properties, will be expanded to other fields like harvest contractors.
The Workforce Participation Minister, Sharman Stone, says they will be allowed to work 30 hours a week up from 15 and receive a $1,600 training grant.
"If you're volunteering to work back on the farm while you're receiving your unemployment benefits and it's a full time commitment you've made, 30 plus hours, you won't have to keep your job seeking up, you don't have to keep presenting a diary saying you've looked for so many jobs, gone to interviews and so on, and that really means you can concentrate on that farm work," Ms Stone said.
