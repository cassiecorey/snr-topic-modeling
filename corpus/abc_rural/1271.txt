Wine expert predicts grape glut's end
A leading wine authority says Australia's grape glut will soon be over and it is nothing to worry about.
Author of the Wine Atlas of Australia James Halliday says boom and bust cycles are a normal part of agriculture.
He says like sugar, wine will revive.
He has played down the fact that up to 100,000 tonnes of grapes were left unpicked in the last Australian harvest.
"That's still only 5 per cent of the total potential harvest, so it's by no means as dramatic as the headlines would have you believe," he said.
