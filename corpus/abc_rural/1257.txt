Surveys to try and identify Timor Sea diamond fields
Oil companies working in the Timor Sea have discovered that there may be diamonds on the Tiwi Islands.
Oil and gas explorers have found evidence of kimberlite, the host rock of diamonds, in the ocean floor west of Melville and Bathurst Islands.
As a result, the Northern Territory's Department of Mines will carry out aerial magnetic surveys of the islands to try to identify new diamond fields.
Richard Brescianini, director of the Northern Territory Geological Survey, dreams of finding a major deposit.
