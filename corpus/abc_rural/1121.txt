Fungal disease could wipe out WA wheat crops
A disease that can completely wipe out wheat crops appeared for the first time this season in Western Australia.
The fungal disease stripe rust, which can reduce crop yields by up to 90 per cent, has been spotted in the state's south, near Esperance.
Agronomist Phil Smyth says farmers are growing wheat varieties with better resistance to the disease but this outbreak could be similar to the epidemic of two years ago.
