New marine species found in reef survey
Several new species of fish, plants and at least one new species of crab have been discovered in a big new survey of the Great Barrier Reef.
Dr Roland Pitcher from the CSIRO says scientists spent more than 300 days at sea covering 536,000 square kilometres of the reef from Cape York to Fraser Island.
"We've seen a number of new fish, possibly a new pipehorse and maybe a new species of crab at least," he said.
"And we can also confirm that there's been a number of species that have been confirmed in Australia waters for the first time.
