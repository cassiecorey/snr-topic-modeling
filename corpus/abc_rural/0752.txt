Wool campaign targets US market
A test marketing campaign for wool has been launched to try to tap into the billion dollar clothing market in the United States.
Saks of Fifth Avenue and retailer Dillards have been signed to try to educate the US consumer about the benefits of wool by marketing woollen trousers.
The Woolmark company says there is a huge market to be gained from the $6 million investment.
But consultant Graham Lean says the push in the US is misguided and the best way to increase grower returns is to cut costs.
