Financial lifeline saves Broken Hill YMCA
The Broken Hill YMCA will open within three months after being thrown a last minute lifeline.
The building was going on the market because it was $50,000 short of funds but it has been given that amount by its governing body.
A team of YMCA Australia staff will be in the city next week to meet with the board and develop a business plan and a long term management strategy.
New staff will be recruited and president Dionne Devlin says it still needs the ongoing support of the local community.
"We start straight away looking at the capital works that need to be done down there and organising the people that want to help and getting straight in and getting things done," she said.
