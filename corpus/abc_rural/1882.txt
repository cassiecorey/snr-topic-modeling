Farm Institute report urges rethink on marketing
An independent farm think tank says the Australian farmer's share of world agriculture exports has fallen by almost $3 billion in a decade.
An Australian Farm Institute report, released today, shows Chile and Brazil's agriculture exports doubled in the 10 years to 2004, while Australia's exports grew by only half that amount.
Report author Selwyn Helibron says farmers must focus on how to market their product to their customers, or continue to lose market share.
