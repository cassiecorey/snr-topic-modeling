Countries aim to salvage trade deal
The world's most influential trade ministers are meeting in Geneva this weekend to try to resurrect global free trade talks.
Six nations, including Australia, will be attempting to salvage a deal.
Australia's push to reduce trade barriers is receiving support from local meat importers in Europe.
The Australian sheepmeat sector is pushing for an increase to the 19,000 tonne sheepmeat quota in the European Union.
One of the biggest importers of lamb and beef into France, Claude Thieblemont, says if import quotas were lifted, local consumption could double.
"France is very short of production, we supply 40 per cent of all needs and we import 60 per cent of our lamb from abroad," he said.
"We would expect to import more from Australia because we like the Australian product. French suppliers [are] buying five kilo per capita per year which is very low and we could multiply this by two or three, easily."
Professor Andrew Stoler from the Institute for International Trade says world leaders appear keen to agree to reforms after this week's G8 summit in St Petersburg.
He says that should help to break the deadlock.
"What is going to move the process forward is not the sort of political direction that came out of the recent G8 meetings," he said.
"You can't really get any higher level than that unless God comes down and tells them you have to get a deal.
