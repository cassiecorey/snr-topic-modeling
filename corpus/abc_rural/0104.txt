Research focuses on merino meat breeding
The merino industry is taking a stand against competition from meat sheep breeds.
While there has been plenty of study into merino wool, less is known about the sheep itself.
A five year project has been researching fertility, worm resistance, muscle and fat depth in more than 10,000 stud sheep.
South Australian breeder Robin Schwartz says the industry's future lies in being able to compete by offering good wool and meat characteristics.
"While wool prices are up and down, and more down than up at the moment, everyone is keen to kick some goals with the meat breeding side of the operations," he said.
