Rain delays sugar harvest
Too much rain has delayed the sugar harvest in northern New South Wales.
Mills are facing a drop in production, with an unusually wet season making crushing difficult and reducing sugar content levels.
Greg Petersen from the Condong Mill near Murwillumbah says the harvest could now drag on until early next year.
"This year has been particularly difficult with the amount of lost time we've had with the wet weather," he said.
