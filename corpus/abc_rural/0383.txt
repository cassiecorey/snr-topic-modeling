Roo shooter numbers may threaten industry
There is concern a record number of kangaroo shooters in Queensland is threatening the industry's future.
Up to 2,000 shooters are registered in Queensland, with 400 new licences granted since October alone.
Jeffrey Newton from the Macropod and Wild Game Harvesters Association says record roo meat prices mean too many people are vying for a share of already limited quotas.
"As with any industry, big dollars attract people that are chasing that quick dollar but unfortunately this industry can't sustain that," he said.
