Flower industry 'needs marketing' to blossom
Flower growers are being told they need to invest up to half-a-million dollars in a national marketing campaign to boost sales.
The industry generates up to $900 million in farm gate sales each year.
Brian Shannon, from the Flower Association of Queensland, says that figure could double, if Australia heeds the British experience.
"They had a marketing campaign over there that increased the sale of cut flowers by 100 per cent over five years," he said.
"What we're trying to do is let our members and growers know that this is the sort of thing we need to do in Australia.
