WA growers
Meanwhile the decision to remove AWB's veto is expected to have the biggest impact on Western Australian growers, with many warehousing their wheat this harvest.
But growers in the west have mixed feelings.
"I think it was a good decision because there was a stalemate and I think it'll be beneficial to WA wheat growers, the ones that have warehoused their wheat," one grower said.
"It also gives protection to the farmers who have delivered into the pool."
"Stripping the right of veto from the AWB this year, in an exceptional drought year and given to Mr McGauran could be fraught with danger," another grower said.
"Before I allocate my wheat I want to know that CBH (Co-operative Bulk Handling) has got a realistic chance of extracting a $20 or $30 a tonne premium," a third wheat grower said.
"If they have, well then that's probably where the wheat will go.
"It's just on a price thing, there's no loyalty left, I don't think."
