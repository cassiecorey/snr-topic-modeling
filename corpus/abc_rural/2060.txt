School children encouraged to grow 1m red poppies
A South Australian farmer is trying to encourage school children to grow a million red poppies to replace the plastic flowers we buy to mark Remembrance Day on November 11.
The poppies symbolise the French battlefields where thousands of young Australians lost their lives during World War I.
Nic Kentish from Mount Gambier has developed pre-packaged kits with seeds, pots and instructions, to encourage students to grow the real thing to raise funds.
