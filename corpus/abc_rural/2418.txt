Early Christmas gift for central NSW farmer
Christmas has arrived early for at least one lucky farmer in central New South Wales.
With water supplies so critically low, many landholders will not be spending the festive season with families who live far away because they cannot risk leaving the farm for even a day in case stock run out of feed and water.
But Paul Stewart from Mudgee was lucky enough to be under an isolated thunderstorm yesterday that has revitalised his Christmas spirits.
"Almost every dam was empty and almost every dam is full to overflowing," he said.
"It was beautiful to watch because we had absolutely no chance of getting away at all with worrying about troughs and pumping water from here to the stock, but we won't have to worry about that now."
The weather bureau is forecasting possible isolated showers and storms late today and tomorrow over most of New South Wales.
A rain band is moving in from the south-west and rain is forecast this weekend right across the state.
