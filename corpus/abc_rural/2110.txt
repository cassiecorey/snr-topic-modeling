Rock lobster fishers hopeful of price recovery
Tasmania's rock lobster industry expects prices to finally recover to pre-SARS level this season.
Fishermen have struggled with low prices since the SARS virus decimated Asian markets in 2003.
Rodney Treloggon from the Tasmanian Rock Lobster Fishermen's Association says the early signs of buoyant markets in China are promising.
"I don't think the general community realises just what a devastating effect SARS had right throughout the fishing industry, not just the rock lobster fishery," he said.
