Shareholders vote not to rebuild Norply factory
The Kyogle community, on the New South Wales north coast, has had its worst fears confirmed with Norply Timbers deciding not to rebuild its factory after a fire last year.
Up until last September's devastating fire, the Norply factory employed about 140 people, making it one of the most significant employers in a town with a population of 4,000.
There were hopes that the company would eventually rebuild on its existing site but those have now been dashed.
Norply's 30 shareholders met earlier this week, when a majority voted to declare a dividend rather than rebuild the mill.
