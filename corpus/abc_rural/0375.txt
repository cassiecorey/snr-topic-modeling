Tennant Creek residents oppose toxic dump
Residents of Tennant Creek in the Territory have rejected suggestions that a national toxic waste dump be built near the town.
Muckaty station just north of Tennant Creek has been identified as a possible site.
Three sites near Alice Springs and Katherine have been short-listed for the dump, but there is growing speculation that none of them will be chosen.
