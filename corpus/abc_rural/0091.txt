SA barley growers vote to keep single desk marketing system
Grain growers in South Australia have voted to keep the single desk marketing system for barley.
A total of 5,900 barley growers were sent out the South Australian Farmers Federation's barley ballot, asking growers whether they wanted to retain the single desk or complete deregulation.
Only 2,000 responded.
This comes after months of debate over poor barley prices which has led to some growers demanding competition for the state's barley market.
Fourteen hundred growers voted yes to the single desk, while 300 voted to remove it but one change has resulted, with 1000 growers wanting an independent single desk, with a similar structure to the Wheat Export Authority.
