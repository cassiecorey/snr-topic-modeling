Lack of rain doesn't prevent crop sowing
Crop sowing is under way in some parts of the country, despite the lack of a significant autumn break in Australia's south-east.
Plenty of unseasonal summer rain has led Western Australian growers to plant canola and lupins earlier than usual, to make the most of sub soil moisture.
Tenindewa farmer Glen Thomas is planting 6,690 hectares but says he is holding back on certain crops, like lupins, because of poor prices.
"We probably would have put even more in, given the summer rain. But we're just going to cap it at [1,000] where that's a big enough risk as it is," he said.
