Saleyards industry worried about livestock dumping
With sheep selling for as little as 10 cents a head in some parts of the country, the New South Wales Shires Association is calling on saleyards to waive their fees.
But the industry is worried that saleyards could become a dumping ground for livestock in poor condition.
David Pollock from the Livestock Saleyards Association of Victoria says farmers must consider the welfare of their animals.
"People should consider whether the animal is fit to load and to be transported, and go through the rigours of the saleyard process before it's sent there," he said.
"And if it's not in that condition, well then it shouldn't come to the saleyard."
And the RSPCA is urging graziers to look after their livestock following the conviction of a 54-year-old farmer from southern New South Wales.
Llewellyn Mark Doulman was convicted on 77 breaches of the Cruelty to Animals Act for his treatment of 2,500 sheep.
