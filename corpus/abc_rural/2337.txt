Aquifers being badly mismanaged: letter
Australia's underground water supplies are in crisis, according to a letter that has been sent to all levels of government.
Written by seven of the country's leading hydro-geologists from the public and private sectors, the document says Australia's aquifers are being badly mismanaged.
Spokesman Dr Rick Evans says on every level, from policy to education, efforts are aimed at repairing rivers, instead of restoring groundwater.
