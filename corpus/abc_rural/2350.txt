Pressure mounts for quick wheat exports decision
Pressure is building on the Federal Government to make a quick decision on wheat exports, with at least half a dozen companies lodging applications.
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran now has the final say on who should be allowed to export wheat after the removal of AWB's veto in the wake of the Cole inquiry.
Sources say Brooks Grain, Cargill, Ozepulse and Louis Dreyfus are among several exporters who have lodged the latest bids for around 3 million tonnes.
But Peter Howard from Ozepulse says it is still unclear if the new system will make it easier for AWB's rivals to export wheat.
"It's new so there is a lack of clarity, I mean we're guessing what's going to happen," he said.
"I would hardly consider it would have any adverse effect on the national pool.
"I can't see if you grant another competitor an approval they've still got to buy the wheat, presumably you can't buy it for any less than what AWB are offering you've got to pay more.
