Milk shortage forces processors to increase prices
Milk shortages caused by dry conditions in Western Australia have forced processors to increase their farm gate milk prices.
The New Zealand-based parent company of Peters and Brownes, Fonterra, has announced a one cent per litre step up for spring.
But Tony Pratico from the WA Farmers Federation says prices need to be substantially raised now.
"I think the processors have to start reviewing it now because the milk's price has to move forward or else on one of the processors here in Western Australia will find themselves without milk," he said.
