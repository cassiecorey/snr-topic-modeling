Beef production pioneer Wright dies
One of the pioneers of modern beef production in Australia has died.
David Wright, 73, headed up a cattle dynasty based on Wallamumbi Station near Armidale in New South Wales.
He was also responsible for developing the V2V breed of cattle, after crossing Australia's oldest hereford herd with new genetic stock.
Mr Wright's cattle empire fell apart after a long-running legal battle in the 1990s.
The founder of the Co-operative Research Centre for Beef, Bernie Bindon, says Mr Wright was a pioneer of the scientific research which now underpins the industry.
"David Wright left his imprint on many aspects of the Australian beef industry," he said.
