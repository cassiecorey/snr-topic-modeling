Dept to lease out ag research stations
In a major shake-up, Western Australia's Department of Agriculture is planning to lease out its 13 agricultural research stations to farmers.
Spokesman Rob Delane says the stations are too small and not productive enough to allow leading research work.
"A small department of agriculture research station with a couple of hundred hectares of bulk crop is not the place to demonstrate leading cropping techniques when our neighbours have got properties five and 10 times our size," he said.
