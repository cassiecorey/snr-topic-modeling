Group opposes giving national parks back to traditional owners
A campaign to prevent 17 national parks being returned to their traditional owners has stepped up in the Northern Territory.
The Territory Government intends to hand over the land title to traditional Indigenous owners, and then lease it back for 99 years under a joint management plan.
With plans to circulate petitions, Save Our Parks campaigner Francoises Builder says there is plenty of opposition to any single group owning parks.
"Parks are free, they are for everybody, so why handing it to a group of people and then leasing it back with taxpayers' money for a million dollars a year?"
"And it is true when you are giving away for example Bondi Beach it's exactly the same thing, we have nothing else to go to."
