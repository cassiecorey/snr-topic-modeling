Abattoir closure to impact on livestock producers
Livestock producers in South Australia's north say they will be hit by higher freight costs, after the closure of Conroy's abattoir at Port Pirie.
The plant closed on Friday and sold to T and R Pastoral, which has no plans to reopen it in the short-term.
One hundred people were employed at the abattoir.
Sandy Morris from Yardea Station in the Gawler Ranges says it will cost him up to $5 a head more to send stock to the meatworks at Murray Bridge instead.
"The impact on us will be that we won't have the option to send them to Pirie which is the closest abattoir for us," he said.
"We'd have to send them on to Murray Bridge, which would be double the amount of freight.
"I'm not quite sure how far Murray Bridge would be from Pirie but it would have to be another 250 [kilometres] I'd imagine. Probably looking at something like $2.50-$5.00."
Meanwhile an abattoir at Stanthorpe, in southern Queensland, says it had to temporarily shut down this morning after temperatures dropped to -20.
The Bureau of Meteorology has reported temperatures of minus six at nearby Warwick and Applethorpe.
John Allan from Don Allan and Co says the abattoir's hot water system froze.
"We still haven't started work because the cold outside froze the pressure of the steam inside our steam valves," he said.
"It just blew from sheer pressure, so that's letting all the steam out now, so we have to replace that now.
