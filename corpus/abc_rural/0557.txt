Birdsville Track pastoralists face continuing drought
After battling seven years of drought pastoralists on the Birdsville Track in South Australia are reaching breaking point.
Some have not had a decent drop of rain since July last year, forcing them to either sell or agist most of their cattle interstate.
Shane Oldfield from Clayton Station says this is the worst he has ever seen it:
"We always get drought's in this country you know two, three years, four years is a real bad one - this is the daddy of them all," he said.
