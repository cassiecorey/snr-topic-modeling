New plant to ensure supplies of Q fever vaccine
Supplies of the vaccine for Q fever have been secured with the Federal Government to fund a new manufacturing plant.
The only manufacturer CSL had stopped making the drug because it is no longer profitable.
The Government will give CSL $9 million for the new plant, which is expected to start production in mid 2009.
But vice president of the Australian Veterinary Association, Dr Matthew Makin, says he wants CSL to release details of its contract arrangements with the Government.
"I guess we want a concrete guarantee that supply of this vaccine will not be interrupted as it has been in the past, so that we can ensure the safe health of those working in the agricultural sector," he said.
"That's where we've been for the last six months. Supply of the vaccine is running out and it has been rationed, so theoretically people who should be receiving it may not be receiving it."
Hunter Valley farmer Bev Adams, who has suffered from the disease, says the announcement is great news.
