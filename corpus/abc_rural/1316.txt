Rio Tinto plans Perth tyre retreading facility
More evidence of the impact of the resources boom has surfaced today as miners see a worldwide shortage driving the price of mining tyres up to $100,000 each.
The huge cost has prompted Rio Tinto to invest in its own tyre retreading facility in Perth, which will open later this year.
Kevin McLeish, from the Rio-owned Argyle Diamonds, says the lengths they have had to go to shows the magnitude of the problem.
"So here you have have a mining company getting into the tyre business, to be able to keep itself open," he said.
