Producers told not to panic over Japanese beef decision
Japan has lifted its ban on US beef but the experts say Australian producers do not need to panic just yet.
Japan will only accept US beef under 20 months of age and from a limited number of accredited meat plants.
Meat and Livestock Australia says Australian exports to Japan should remain steady at around 390,000 tonnes a year.
Malcolm Foster from the Australian Lotfeeders Association does not think the US will pose any short-term threat and says other markets are available anyway.
"The alternate markets to Japan are obviously other Asian markets, in particular Korea, Taiwan and those markets, although markets in the Middle East and even markets in Russia are starting to open up now for Australian exporters," he said.
"So there are other markets but Japan will always be a very important one for us."
US cattlemen are upset over the tough restrictions imposed by Tokyo.
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association argues Japan's partial reopening is just a first step toward full resumption of trade worth $US1.4 billion, before America lost the market to Australia following a 2003 mad cow case.
The association's Jay Truitt says Tokyo's limits on US cattle age and number of plants that can ship is far too restrictive.
"Everyone of these restrictions adds cost to the system - that's not what we want," he said.
