Benetton wool deal collapses
A major deal to double Australian wool sales to Italian fashion giant Benetton has collapsed.
The $1.6 million deal to step up sales to 4 million kilograms a year was only announced two weeks ago and would have made Benetton one of Australia's biggest wool retailers.
Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) will not go into detail, but says since the announcement issues have come up which can not be resolved by either company.
Chief executive Len Stephens is urging others not to use the collapse as an excuse to destabilise the wool industry.
