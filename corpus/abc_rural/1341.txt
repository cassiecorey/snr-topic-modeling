Australia on track for driest August on record
The National Climate Centre says we could be shaping up for another major drought year if it does not rain soon.
Australia is on track for its driest August on record, with an average of just 2.6 millimetres of rain so far this month, compared to the lowest recorded total of 7.1 millimetres.
Meteorologist Blair Trewin says while south-west WA is in trouble, the eastern states are in a slightly better position because of rain last month.
"[It] certainly hasn't been as dry as years like 1994 and 2002 generally speaking," he aid.
"If we were to have a very dry September/October period then we might start getting down into the kind of territory we saw in 1994 and 2002, but our outlook is not currently indicating a particularly high chance of that happening."
