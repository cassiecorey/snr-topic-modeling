NSW irrigators saved from huge tax compo bill
New South Wales irrigators who won a $100 million compensation package after losing access to ground water will no longer lose a big part of the money in tax.
Fourteen hundred irrigators received money to compensate them for a move to claim back over-allocated ground water resources.
The Federal Government had treated the payments as income, and demanded tax be paid.
Prime Minister John Howard has now intervened, saying the money is compensation and should not be taxed.
But Federal Member for Gwydir, John Anderson, admits not all payments will be tax-free.
"If it's a pre-85 asset, which most of them would be, there's no tax," he said.
