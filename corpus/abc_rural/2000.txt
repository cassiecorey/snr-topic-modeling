Anthrax season starts early
New South Wales has had an early start to the anthrax season, with two properties already suffering stock losses.
The state normally sees about four cases of stock losses from anthrax each year.
Catherine Taragel from the Department of Primary Industries says, "we have had an early start to the summer period and we have started to see anthrax cases," she said.
