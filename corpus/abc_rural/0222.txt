Flooding continues in western Qld
Flooding is continuing to cause problems in Queensland.
Heavy rain in the state's central mid-west last week has cut roads around Longreach but flooding in the Thomson River is expected to be a boon for graziers.
Moderate flooding is now expected to extend downstream to Jundah.
Further north, the barramundi are biting after the floodwaters and Arthur McDouall almost landed one in the main street of Normanton.
"Threw a line in down there for a while virtually at the end of the main street, had a barra on there almost straightaway, got him to the edge of the bank and he jumped off the hook but you get in the right place at the right time they get some good catches when the floods are on," he said.
