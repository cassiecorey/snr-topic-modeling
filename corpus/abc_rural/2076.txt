Chicken deaths blamed on chemical in feed
The deaths of almost 50,000 chickens on two farms near Brisbane has been attributed to an accident involving a load of feed.
The food contained high levels of Nicarbazin which is used to control parasites.
The farms and the feed supplier have not been identified by Queensland Health or food safety authorities.
Dr Andreas Dubs from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation says the 150,000 chickens that recovered from last week's overdose have been cleared for human consumption.
"The chemical is one which is used as medication quite frequently," he said.
"But in this instance it shouldn't have been there and it was present in the feed at a much higher dose than it would normally be used.
