Strategy tackles vegie supply plan for remote communities
Aboriginal communities should get better supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables, following the remote Indigenous stores conference held in Adelaide this week.
Community leaders, store managers and freight companies, from three states and the Northern Territory, collaborated to work out better ways to improve delivery of perishable goods.
Many neighbouring communities have been using different trucking companies and in far north WA, Bililuna store manager Tom Waller says hopefully they can now get their vegies more than once a fortnight.
