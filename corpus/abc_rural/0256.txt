Easter gifts may post disease risk: AQIS
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is warning that Easter gifts from overseas, such as painted or blown eggs, could spread bird flu to humans and birds.
Carson Creagh from AQIS says the service will seize hundreds of "at risk" items this weekend including eggs, feathers and nests made of dried grapevines, and straw.
He says many come from Eastern Europe or the Mediterranean and could introduce bird flu, Newcastle disease or other viruses capable of devastating Australia's poultry industry.
"The obvious one is avian influenza which can be transmitted on eggs," he said.
