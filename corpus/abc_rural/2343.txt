Bush called on to halt S Korea free trade talks
Key US farm state senators are demanding the Bush Administration end free trade talks with South Korea, until Seoul ends a defacto ban on imports of US beef.
The seven senators made their request after the Koreans rejected three US beef shipments on claims the meat had tiny bone fragments.
Agriculture committee spokesman Keith Williams says the law-makers just ran out of patience.
"Unless the exports of US beef resume and both countries are able to agree on a reasonable and fair bone tolerance level for future shipments, then, anything less than that, would result in the opposition of the senators that signed this letter," he said.
