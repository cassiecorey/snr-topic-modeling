Drought expected to cut cotton production
Analysts are predicting cotton growers this season will plant Australia's smallest crop in nearly 20 years.
Independent Commodity Management's Matthew Leeson says a range of factors, including the drought, will cut production to about 1 million bales.
He says the commodity's subdued price is also significant.
"Compounding the marginal moisture availability is poor price for cotton versus the well above average price for the feed grains due to the shortfall from the winter cereal crop this year," he said.
