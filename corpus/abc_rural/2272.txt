NFF backs calls for climate change action
The National Farmers Federation (NFF) has joined calls for early action to tackle climate change.
Members of the NFF's policy council have voted to become part of the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change.
President David Crombie says the nation's farming bodies need to involved in efforts to address climate change because of the impact it will have on agriculture.
His calls come as the Federal Government confirms that Australia's greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise by 22 per cent by 2020.
The bleak news is contained in its State of the Environment report, released today in Canberra.
The report also confirms there has been five years of lower than average rainfall across most of eastern Australia and that Perth's water supply catchments are yielding half as much water as they did in the 70s.
Committee chairman Associate Professor Bob Beeton says things will get worse before they get better.
"Some of the heritage properties may decline, some biodiversity may decline, river health may continue at a very low level and the CO2 levels obviously continue to increase," he said.
"The amount of energy use in Australia is still increasing and we need to figure out what we're going to do about that."
Meanwhile, the energy sector says managing climate change will be its greatest challenge for the next few decades.
The Energy Futures Forum has released a report which says future investment will hinge of the industry's response to climate change.
But forum member Tony Wood says developing countries will have to make an effort as well.
"No-one would suggest that Australia should act unilaterally forever," he said.
"(A) we would just damage our own economy and (b), we wouldn't solve the problem of climate change anyway, so there's no doubt we require a global solution.
