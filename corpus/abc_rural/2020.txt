Uranium price expected to rise
The price of uranium continues to climb steadily, with predictions it could hit $US100 a pound by next year.
It is currently sitting at $US60, up from just $US10 five years ago.
ANZ Bank commodities analyst Andrew Harrington does not think the price will go quite so high but says demand is far outstripping supply.
He says there are 50 nuclear power reactors being planned around the world and the supply of uranium from old nuclear weapons is drying up.
"Nuclear weapons, the linchpin in supply for a long time but recycled nuclear bombs are fewer and fewer between in the old Soviet Union and the United States," he said.
