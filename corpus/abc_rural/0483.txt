Calls to scrap WET tax
The Western Australian wine industry wants the Wine Equalisation Tax (WET) abolished despite a big Budget boost.
The Federal Government has increased tax rebates to smaller wine producers by $210,000.
They are available to producers with up to $1.7 million in sales.
But Ron Fraser from the Margaret River Wine Association says it is band-aid therapy, which is lulling smaller producers into a false sense of security
"It's avoiding the issue that the WET tax is an impost on the cost of wine and should be scrapped altogether," he said.
"The only way that you can get the benefits from this extra threshold is to increase your sales and in today's market to increase your sales is an increasingly difficult job.
