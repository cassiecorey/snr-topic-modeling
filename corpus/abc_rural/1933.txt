Storms bring good and bad to mid-west farmers
It has been a mix of pain and good fortune for Western Australia's farmers and pastoralists, after wild storms tore through the Gascoyne, Murchison and parts of the mid-west and northern wheatbelt.
Strong winds and rainfall of 60 to 90 millimetres destroyed some farm crops and damaged fences.
But further north, pastoralists have welcomed the rain after such a dry winter.
Geoff Pilkington from Kirkalocka Station, south of Mt Magnet, says strong winds and hail created a fierce storm.
"Dark skies and threatening for most of the morning and then the heavens just opened and it was just amazing," he said.
"At the mine site and in Mt Magnet town site, there was huge hail stones and apparently they were the size of golf balls and two or three inches thick on the ground, so it's just an amazing event."
