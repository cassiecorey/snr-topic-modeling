Bellamy reflects on Irwin legacy
After the shock death of naturalist and television star Steve Irwin yesterday, talk is turning to the legacy the Queenslander has left behind.
The man known as the Crocodile Hunter died after being stabbed by a sting ray barb as he filmed a documentary off the coast of far north Queensland.
British naturalist David Bellamy says he admired Steve Irwin's capacity to invest personally in the environment.
