Ag pilots dispute crash statistics findings
New research from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) says agricultural pilots do not get enough training and are overly represented in crash statistics.
The research, which looked at wire strike accidents where planes hit power lines or other wires, found 65 per cent of low level flying accidents happened in farming.
Head of the Aerial Agricultural Association, Phil Hurst, disputes the findings and says the industry has improved its safety record.
