McGauran supports environmental stewardship concept
Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran has told a national conference on land management that the Government supports the idea of paying farmers for environmental work.
Mr McGauran has backed the environmental stewardship concept at the first national gathering of Australia's 56 natural resource management groups on the Gold Coast.
Andrew Drysdale from the Queensland Regional Groups Collective says the payment scheme is welcome but might not come into effect until 2008.
"The noise that [is] coming out of Canberra, it's not only about funding but how the funding is going to occur," he said.
"They're starting to talk about stewardship payments now which breaches that problem of being tied to election cycles.
