Caution urged over fruit fly outbreak
Victorian agriculture authorities are urging residents in the state's north-east to be careful handling fruit in the wake of the fruit fly outbreak just over the border.
The Department of Primary Industries has discovered the pest in the New South Wales border town of Mulwala.
Spokesman Bill Aschroft says fruit cannot be taken out of a 15 kilometre quarantine zone and measures are in place to contain the outbreak.
"People need to be aware that in all of these towns and in fact right across north-eastern Victoria and the corresponding areas on the north of the river, that they shouldn't be moving fruit around because there is a risk that fruit fly will be in the fruit or associated with it," he said.
