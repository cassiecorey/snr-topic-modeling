AWB rejects wheat export system plan
AWB has rejected a new plan to overhaul the wheat export system and says it is wrong to make changes based on assumptions the industry is in crisis.
The plan, unveiled by the Grains Council, would remove AWB's power to block other companies exporting wheat and increase shipments from AWB's rivals.
Attacking the plan, AWB chairman Brendan Stewart told Grains Week delegates, the industry was not in crisis because of the Iraq kickbacks scandal.
"What I see at the moment is a debate that's being done is a vacuum and debate that's being done in a self-induced crisis mode which I have to say is not there," he said.
The discussion paper suggests AWB could lose the single desk in 2010, while a new body called Australian Wheat Associates would take over the company's veto powers.
But AWB's Ian Donges told delegates is was dangerous to base Australia Wheat Associates on industry companies like Meat and Livestock Australia.
"I wouldn't use that as a model that necessarily is going to deliver a better outcome just because it is a model. There are other ways of doing it," he said.
Mr Donges also says the timelines to implement the plan where unlikely to be achieved.
The discussion paper has also been criticised by growers and AWB's rivals.
The New South Wales Farmers Association says it will not support any plan which increases exports through companies other than AWB.
There was also an attempt from one grower to call a no-confidence motion in the Grains Council.
The Grain Exporters Association's Alick Osborne says while the plan provides for increased export competition, it does not go far enough.
"This may go some way to sharpening that process up if there are other exporters that can access particular markets and can post their bids," he said.
