Vic experts play part in mine rescue
Three mining explosives experts from Victoria have played a role in the final stages of the Beaconsfield Gold mine rescue.
The tunnel inching towards the two trapped men hit very hard silt stone, which resisted the hand drills and jack hammers.
General manager of Stawell Gold Mines Mark Mitchell says the men tested the explosives in other parts of the mine before they had to be used in the Beaconsfield rescue shaft.
"We sent the guys down to help with the PCS type explosive, which you would have heard people talking about," he said.
"We use that at Stawell Gold Mines for a number of tasks. It's something we use in the normal course of our operations. We don't consider it to be a particularly specialist thing, it's just something we have some experience in.
