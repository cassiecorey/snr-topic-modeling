Heemskirk wind farm mothballed
The Federal Government's decision not to increase renewable energy targets is being blamed for a decision to mothball Tasmania's $300 million Heemskirk wind farm.
Tasmanian energy company Roaring 40s says it remains committed to existing Australian projects but will be wind back work on new developments.
Managing director Mark Kelleher says there are no incentives for electricity retailers to buy wind energy, making Heemskirk unviable.
