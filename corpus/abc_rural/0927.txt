Feral pigs destroy Ingham crops
Farmers in north Queensland say they are being overwhelmed by feral pigs.
Ingham cane farmer Tony Palmas believes the devastation of cyclone Larry could have forced many pigs out of their usual haunts to find food.
Mr Palmas says he has lost crops worth up to $20,000.
He says shooting the pigs is not working and there is no fruit available to use in traps.
"We used to get bananas from north like Innisfail and Tully but for the moment there's no bananas coming from there and there's no mangoes or anything like that," he said.
