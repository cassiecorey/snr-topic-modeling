Local customers remain priority for WA banana growers
Western Australian banana growers continue to face pressure to send fruit to the eastern states.
Two and a half weeks ago, fruit from Carnarvon was raised as a solution to an impending nation-wide banana shortage in the wake of cyclone Larry in Queensland.
But agent John Mercer met growers in Carnarvon last night and he says while the pressure from the east is intense, Perth markets still remain a top priority.
"We're now two and a half weeks wiser then we where before. Certainly the overwhelming thing that came out of the meeting last night is that we want to supply WA customers first," he said.
"If per chance the demand from the eastern states gets greater than that, there's a possibility we may send some fruit east. My guess is long term we'll send a little bit of fruit over there."
Meanwhile the Federal Government has promised to review assistance given to cyclone-affected farmers in north Queensland if necessary.
Banana growers have criticised the Government's $200 a week wage subsidy to keep workers on farms.
