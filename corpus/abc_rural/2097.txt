Burdekin River regeneration underway
Work has begun on the regeneration of the Burdekin River catchment in North Queensland.
The Burdekin is one of nine Australian rivers to be targeted by Greening Australia's Rivers to Recovery program.
Spokesman Bob Osborne says the Burdekin is one of the most endangered ecosystems in Queensland, with the project to take up to 20 years, and cost around $20 million.
"We're trying to get less nutrients in the water, which means more money for farmers; get rid of the weeds in the water system, that brings back oxygen, that brings back fish and that gets the community in," Mr Osborne said.
