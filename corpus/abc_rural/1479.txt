Biofuel industry unviable without Govt support, says expert
A new report has confirmed calls by the renewable energy sector for more support from the Federal Government.
The report from Rabobank, a leading agribusiness bank, says a serious biofuels industry is unviable unless there is a long-term policy commitment.
Spokeswoman Ingrid Richardson says ethanol and biodiesel production will not be economical unless there are Government mandates.
"My report looks at what's happened in the US, what's happened in Brazil, what's happened in Europe and basically all the support there is very long term," she said.
