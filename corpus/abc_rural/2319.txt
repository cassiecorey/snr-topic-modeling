Growers warned not to sign contracts
There are claims today agents and merchants in the fruit and vegetable markets are trying to get around the looming mandatory code of conduct.
Growers say they are being offered contracts before the new code is introduced into Federal Parliament.
The code aims to make the sales process more transparent, so growers can see what happens with their products.
Peter Darley from the New South Wales Farmers Association says growers should not sign anything just yet.
"I have had phone calls from producers as of yesterday saying that there are ... contracts being presented by agents for them to look at and consider the obligations of signing contracts," he said.
"I would suggest to growers at this stage the code has not been enacted on yet in Parliament.
"If they are going to sign, that they certainly get an independent opinion before they go ahead and sign those contracts in consideration of their business."
The wholesale sector admits it is trying to circumvent the code before it is made law.
