Push on for higher capital gains tax threshold
There are calls for the capital gains tax (CGT) threshold to be lifted to at least $10 million to protect farmers.
Combined assets worth more than $5 million mean farmers cannot access small business concessions on the tax.
It is starting to hit farm families when they try to expand, relocate or retire, because of rising property prices.
South Australian accountant Peter Hayes is part of a group that is lobbying federal politicians to increase the threshold, which has not changed for seven years.
"One client of mine wanted to relocate and their combined assets were in the order of $6 million, so they didn't comply with the CGT small business threshold and for them to move was going to cost them $1 million in tax," he said.
