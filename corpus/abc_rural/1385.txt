Bishop makes no promises on education report
The federal Education Minister, Julie Bishop, has officially launched a report about the drought's impact on education, but has failed to give any commitment to implement its recommendations.
The study has called for more financial assistance to help drought-affected families educate their children.
Rural and remote families in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria were interviewed as part of the study by Charles Sturt University.
It paid particular attention to tertiary education and found that rural students are disadvantaged.
It recommended that those who have to move away from home to attend university should be automatically eligible for youth allowance.
At the launch, Ms Bishop acknowledged the challenges of rural education, saying the Government is continually reviewing its assistance programs.
