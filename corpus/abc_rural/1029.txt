European snail found in Launceston
A European snail has been found in Australia, discovered on the outside of grain containers in Launceston in northern Tasmania.
Known as white snails, they arrived on containers of lupins from Western Australia.
Danny Reardon from Quarantine Tasmania says the situation was dealt with quickly and he defends quarantine officers at the port of Fremantle, through which the snails apparently passed undetected.
"When you come to think about it, there's hundreds of thousands of containers coming into the country and there's always a possibility that things will get through the barrier," he said.
"It all depends on what stage the snails were at when they come in. They could've been in the form of eggs, they may not have been developed, they could have developed during the storage process there.
