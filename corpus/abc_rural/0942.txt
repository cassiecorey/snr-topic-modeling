Inquiry likely to recommend geosequestration: researcher
Researchers believe a federal Parliament inquiry will help find funding for more projects to stop greenhouse gases from coal, oil and gas fields entering the atmosphere.
The House of Representatives Science and Innovation Committee will investigate the benefits and risks of geosequestration, which is capturing carbon dioxide from mining and storing it underground for millions of years.
Trials are being carried out in Victoria's Otway Basin and off the Western Australian coast.
Dr Peter Cook, from the Co-operative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies, says studies are making progress.
"We're very confident that that inquiry is going to endorse the use of this technology as one of the options for decreasing CO2 emissions," he said.
