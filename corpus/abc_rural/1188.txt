Trade policy expert talks up possibility of Japan FTA
An expert on trade policy says the prospects for a lucrative free trade agreement (FTA) between Australia and Japan have never been better.
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer discussed a possible FTA with the Japanese Prime Minister in Tokyo yesterday and both countries are completing a feasibility study.
Dr Ann Capling from Melbourne University is studying the potential benefits of such an agreement, which was flatly rejected by the Japanese Government in 2002.
Japan is already Australia's most important trading partner, but quotas and high tariffs continue to restrict exports of beef, dairy, pork, grains, oilseeds, and fruit, and vegetables.
Dr Capling says there is increasing pressure on Japan to allow more of these supplies in.
