BJD trace proves NLIS's worth: vet
The Queensland Government has rejected criticism of the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS), after using it for the first time to track six potentially diseased cattle across three states.
The system, which aims to achieve whole-of-life traceability, has been accused of being inaccurate and costly, and is now subject to an independent audit.
But Queensland's principal veterinary officer, Dr Rick Webster, says the system has been used to trace cattle from a herd diagnosed with Bovine Johnes disease (BJD), avoiding a costly eradication program.
"Because of NLIS we were able to check the records and see that all six animals had all been slaughtered and they had only spent time alive in feedlots," he said.
