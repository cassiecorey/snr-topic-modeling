Not enough full-time doctors
While rural Australia continues to cry out for doctors, there's now alarm over the falling number of doctors willing to work full time.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says the number of full-time GPs fell more than 30 per cent between 2000 and 2004.
It says some country residents are now waiting up to three weeks for an appointment.
Dr Peter Rischbieth, from the Rural Doctors Association, says the holiday season will put extra pressure on rural communities.
"There are some towns that have massive influxes of population through the tourist and holiday season, and some of these towns do struggle to provide appointments for both their residents and the tourists who are arriving, as well as some doctors understandably wanting to have leave during this time with their families√Ç"
