Wool grower wants mulesing trial money redirected
Wool growers are being urged to start breeding so-called bare-bum sheep now to stave off future controversy over surgical mulesing.
The industry has vowed to phase out mulesing by 2010 to placate animal welfare groups.
Dubbo grazier Don Mudford is already breeding sheep that do not need mulesing and believes the industry should be spending more money on marketing, instead of searching for mulesing alternatives.
"Because the day will come whether it's in three years or not, the day will come when they won't be able to mules but to stop mulesing the whole flock will take a few years," he said.
