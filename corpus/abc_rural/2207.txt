Goulburn wins water-saving award
The residents of one of Australia's driest cities have been recognised for their efforts to conserve water.
Goulburn in southern New South Wales has halved its domestic water usage under stage five water restrictions over the past 18 months.
Now the council has won a National Water Conservation Award for Excellence, ahead of 700 councils from around the country.
Goulburn-Mulwaree Mayor Paul Stephenson says the council is now applying for state funding to install a cover for the Pejar dam to reduce evaporation.
"It still allows the ultra-violet rays to get through to do the normal purification of your water, it reflects a lot of the heat," he said.
"Your blue-green algae problems start to dissipate and you stop all the wind action because these things are moored up reasonably close together.
