Threatened squirrel gilder found in south-east SA
A mammal, similar to a sugar glider, has been found for the first time in the south-east of South Australia.
The squirrel glider is a threatened species more commonly found in western Victorian woodlands and along the eastern seaboard.
SA Department of Environment ecologist Dan Harley says the discovery was made by a researcher at the Museum of South Australia, who thought she was looking at a collection of sugar gliders.
"When she got to this handful of specimens from the Bordertown area, she got some really weird results and scratched her head and couldn't work out what was going on," he said.
