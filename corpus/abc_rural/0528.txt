Draft dairy report recommends support for GM crops
The dairy industry has been embarrassed by the leaking of a draft report that recommends it join other agricultural industries in supporting genetically modified (GM) crops.
Until now state governments have had the backing of the dairy industry in banning commercial GM crops.
The draft report was commissioned by the Australian Dairy Industry Council (ADIC) and was not due to be released until much later this year.
Policy director with Australian Dairy Farmers, Robert Poole, says the current policy was written seven years ago, and was due for review.
"Had we not had it happen where it's now become public we would have certainly gone to the point where we would have consulted widely especially with dairy farmers and with dairy companies, although they're part of the ADIC process and obviously ultimately governments as well," he said.
Mr Poole says it is a draft report and not industry policy.
Meanwhile a leading plant breeder says the dairy industry would save millions of dollars, if it embraced GM crops.
Viruses in pastures such as white clover cost the industry $110 million a year, but a virus-resistant clover could be on-farm by 2009.
Research director Professor German Spangenberg says that is just one reason for introducing genetically modified technology.
