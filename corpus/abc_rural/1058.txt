Tuna industry welcomes poaching report
A report that Japanese fishermen may have illegally caught more than $5 billion in tuna over the past 20 years has been welcomed by the Australian industry.
The report by the International Commission for the Conservation of Bluefin Tuna found that about 8,500 tonnes of tuna are being poached each year.
Brian Jeffriess from the Tuna Boat Owners Association says while illegal fishing has cost them income, the figures show there is more tuna in the wild than previously thought.
"That's a large loss of income over the last 20 years, if the report is correct," Mr Jeffriess said.
"That's a worrying situation.
"Strangely enough, if indeed it's true, then it shows the stock in a much stronger condition.
"The way the science works is in fact that the more that has been caught, the more productive the stock is.
