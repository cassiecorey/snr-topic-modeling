Ethanol plant proposal shelved
The Australian ethanol industry has taken another blow, with Bundaberg Sugar deciding to shelve a $20 million ethanol plant in north Queensland.
The company has blamed a lack of ethanol buyers for the decision, but also acknowledges it was unlikely to meet a deadline to qualify for $12 million in federal assistance.
Caroline Honan, from leading ethanol producer, the Manildra Group, says the Federal Government must do more for the fledgling biofuels sector.
