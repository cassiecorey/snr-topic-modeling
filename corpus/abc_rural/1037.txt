Olive leaves show cancer-killing potential
Laboratory tests of an extract from olive leaves have shown it can kill prostate and breast cancer cells.
Southern Cross University researchers on the north coast of New South Wales completed the work for a manufacturer of the extract.
The university's Dr Lesley Stevensen says the results sound remarkable, but need to be considered in context.
She says clinical trials are needed to test the lab theory.
"The effects that we found were lethal in that they would actually kill the cells if you like," she said.
