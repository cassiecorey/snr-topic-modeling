Top price ram sells for $21,000
Despite ongoing dry conditions, average prices rose to around $3,700 at yesterday's ram sale at the Royal Adelaide Show.
The top price ram from the Nyowee Stud at Balaklava sold for $21,000.
Peter Meyer, who brought the ram in partnership with two others, says interest from South American buyers shored up the prices.
"Prices paid in the past, many years ago, when the wool industry was booming and semen sales first started to come into vogue, probably over-valued some rams," he said.
