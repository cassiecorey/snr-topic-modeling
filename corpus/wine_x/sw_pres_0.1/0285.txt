dense colour . quite syrah - like at first , but more baked ( almost burnt ) plum fruit after a while . good texture - feels nice in the mouth . good structure too - this is a rather good , characterful wine . still improving and needing time , but perhaps it won ' t actually quite rate more stars . ***
