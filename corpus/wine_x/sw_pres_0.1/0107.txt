quite tight and lean , i wondered a bit whether it wasn ' t a little thin when judged by the highest standards , but while not an absolute star , more and more emerged with some breathing . very well - defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity . excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage . top ***
