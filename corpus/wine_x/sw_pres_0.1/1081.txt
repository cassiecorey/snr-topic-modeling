most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago . i have since discovered from the nice people at gosset that it is a 93 + 94 + 95 blend . lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones . some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and i suppose it is although i don ' t find it remotely a problem . very rich but now in perfect balance . ****
