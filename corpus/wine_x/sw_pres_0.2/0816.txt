nice fruit , very drinkable . quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard . good balance too . but nice though it is , i find it rather undemanding - no tautness , no succulence , in short no really grown - up qualities . i ' d hope for more excitment from this vineyard . still a fine drink , and it doesn ' t sell for huge money either . ***
