it ' s easy to scoff at musar , and until today i hadn ' t opened one of my own bottles for a year or two , but it ' s really not half bad you know . rustic , yes - ultimately fairly simple , yes - but it does have lovely round , sweet , leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft , amber - edged maturity . so it ' s easy to scoff in the other sense too . ***
