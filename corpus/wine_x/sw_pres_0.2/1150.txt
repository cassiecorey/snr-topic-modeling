these three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that fwd isn ' t always very kind to beaujolais . i tasted these with ljm ( sometime contributor to fwd ). i ' m afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about beaujolais . but they have persuaded me that i need to try a few more .
