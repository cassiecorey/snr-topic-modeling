i don ' t get to try an awful lot of bacchus nowadays , although way back i used to attend the english wine fair and try samples there . i can ' t say i miss it much . this wine is floral , grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon - like flavours . strangely for a cleanly made 11 % white wine , it isn ' t the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it ' s not unpleasant , just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds . hopefully the champagne style pinot that was also sent will be more interesting . *
