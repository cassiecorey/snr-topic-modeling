a bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner . bright and attractive raspberry , cranberry and beetroot pinot - a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style . very pleasant drinking but not profound . will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long - term wine . *** some doing such were ourselves up at most into will what than ours off again while at to but above with have did his should him then
