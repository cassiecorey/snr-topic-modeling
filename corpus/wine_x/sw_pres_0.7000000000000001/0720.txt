i have quite a lot of this wine , and i have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether i needed to rush to drink it up . on this bottle ' s showing , i need not have too many worries about that . not quite up to the standard of the previous wine ( it somehow lacks the breeding ), but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together . no rush to drink up . **** as such to yours me they than t ours now our itself him ours below themselves who
