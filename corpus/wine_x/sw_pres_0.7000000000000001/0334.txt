lovely appetising , drinkable wine ( breaking for another mouthful as i type ). not a hint of the varietal flab , yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones . something of almonds about the whole package too . this has the balance to keep well for a while i feel , and it may even improve over a year or so . dry yet not austere , and with really good length . classy . *** if i does doing yourself further has doing yourselves now me few are because but their too my he how than so where of
