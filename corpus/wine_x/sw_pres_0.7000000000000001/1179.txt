ok , so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage . the label wasn ' t in the best condition . the next morning i was just sorting through the corks when i noticed we had really been drinking the 1982 . the last time i had this wine i was disappointed , and i was again this time . it ' s ok , but it hasn ' t got the structure or depth expected . *** can again will up it up its himself some their don yourself himself below few s my
