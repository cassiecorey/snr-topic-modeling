lovely appetising , drinkable wine ( breaking for another mouthful as i type ). not a hint of the varietal flab , yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones . something of almonds about the whole package too . this has the balance to keep well for a while i feel , and it may even improve over a year or so . dry yet not austere , and with really good length . classy . *** off if any who no their own over again all any did no i this then he not by before against by it ours off those not its these for for than any can my you some yourself own and
