this was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of bin - end offers : the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule . however , the wine inside was lovely . this was as tight a riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity . a really fine effort with time ahead . ***(*) out am yourself other some some theirs are don its as hers more me him this have under has his above did my until again once above off which we the have under do of myself
