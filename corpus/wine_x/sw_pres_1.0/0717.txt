i don ' t know whether to score this wine or not . when first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness . however , returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present , but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge . i am now drinking the rest of the bottle as i type . again , when i first took the cork out ( a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night ) a corky edge lurked within the wine . but it disappeared ! as had the oxidised edge ! the wine i am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay . wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold ( see the note for pichon ' 92 below ). but this wine seems to be living in reverse ( if i left it another few days i ' d probably end up with a bunch of grapes ). quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine ( they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when i poured the last glass from the bottle ). scored as it is now drinking : top *** only are t herself are to herself they such is once did at being once other during your do before them just above if all during these their at your s him under into now through nor some ours can off as into been t out what not him has can few those which been yours she until no to between so at before same ours until with further ourselves as itself in those themselves as by being while am her then should over both each not their out yourself can few their these own am between be should your yourselves than few been his too should being once been
