my memory of vintages of this provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good : provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box . very much a point and it has kept well . a little simple perhaps but i believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property . good effort - i ' d like to try some other vintages . *** about some each its hers hers where
