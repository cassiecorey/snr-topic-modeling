the lamaione is a disappointing wine . i remember having it for the fist time ( before fwd , in 1995 or earlier i guess ). then it oozed class , and in 1997 i still rated it highly . but since then it has declined , and now one word will do : ' undrinkable ' - although i ' ve expanded slightly beyond that below . i wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making ( carb . mac .?). there aren ' t many wines i ' ve poured down the sink , but this was one of them . again he few now each your why my whom
