i don ' t know whether to score this wine or not . when first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness . however , returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present , but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge . i am now drinking the rest of the bottle as i type . again , when i first took the cork out ( a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night ) a corky edge lurked within the wine . but it disappeared ! as had the oxidised edge ! the wine i am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay . wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold ( see the note for pichon ' 92 below ). but this wine seems to be living in reverse ( if i left it another few days i ' d probably end up with a bunch of grapes ). quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine ( they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when i poured the last glass from the bottle ). scored as it is now drinking : top *** have for having themselves own t are
