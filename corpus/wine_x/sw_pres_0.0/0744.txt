rich and full , fairly advanced ( as the wines from this producer often are ) but no sign of the premature oxidation tha plagues the vintage . there ' s a bitter edge to the fruit that stops me giving the highest rating - it ' s a funny thing , bitterness : sometimes it seems an asset to a wine sometimes a problem . i ' m not so keen on its manifestation in this wine . still a top ***
