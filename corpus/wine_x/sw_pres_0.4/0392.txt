the things one finds when cataloguing the cellar - an auction purchase of a couple of bottles i seem to recall . i opened one with trepidation but no need : actually a healthy light colour and a lovely , fresh , tar and roses barolo nose . the fruit had that underlying sweetness that good barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins . not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking . ***
