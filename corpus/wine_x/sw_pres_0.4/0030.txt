huge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather . i find this a bit much . returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit and to be a substantial wine in its way , although i find it hard to decide about it . many will admire this , and i may too given time to consider it - i had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed . i think i ' ll reserve judgement for now . not rated
