Lovely appetising, drinkable wine (breaking for another mouthful as I type).   Not a hint of the varietal flab, yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones. Something of almonds about the whole package too.  This has the balance to keep well for a while I feel, and it may even improve over a year or so.  Dry yet not austere, and with really good length.  Classy. ***
