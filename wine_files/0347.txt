This has now opened up nicely - gorgeous long, mouthfilling greengage fruit.   It was so tight a few years ago and it has been fascinating to watch its progress.  It is bone dry and has that Wachau sternness that (slightly to my surprise) I am often a bit ambivalent about.  This though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it's just a mistage to try and drink these wines young.  Very top ***
