Rich and full, fairly advanced (as the wines from this producer often are) but no sign of the premature oxidation tha plagues the vintage.  There's a bitter edge to the fruit that stops me giving the highest rating - it's a funny thing, bitterness:  sometimes it seems  an asset to a wine sometimes a problem.  I'm not so  keen on its manifestation in this wine.  Still a top ***
