The second bottle of H. Lignier 1er cru from this vintage I have tried recently.  This is so pure, digestible and generally fine, but understated - it doesn't shout and it doesn't have a particular note of individuality for me.   Yet it is a complete wine that I like a lot.   Beginning to drink well, but not a long-haul wine.   Top ***
