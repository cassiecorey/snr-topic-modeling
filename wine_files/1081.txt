Most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago.  I have since discovered from the nice people at Gosset that it is a 93+94+95 blend.  Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones.  Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don't find it remotely a problem.  Very rich but now in perfect balance. ****
