Very graceful, almondy nose - slightly floral, but pleasingly free of overt varietal statement.  (I think it's a blend of various varieties, for what it's worth.)  On the palate, completely balanced with perfect acidity and a touch of ripe lemon around a concentrated but understated palate.  Very fine.  ****
