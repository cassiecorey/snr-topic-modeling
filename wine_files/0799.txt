100% old-vine Pinot Meunier and thus interesting.   Floral and perhaps floury (or am I being influenced by the name of the grape) fruit, quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the mid-palate with an ordinary finish.   Real Champagne balance (quite dry) makes it pretty drinkable however, although it is hard to find much real complexity.   An oddity that is worth trying, particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like Moet NV, for instance.  Scrapes ***
