Quite fat and mouthfilling - I haven't drunk this producers wines or Chablis from this vintage much so I'm not sure about the cause of this rather atypical richness.   Still, this has a lovely honey-influenced palate and enough underlying minerality to be very enjoyable. Absolutely at peak.  From a half.   Top ***
