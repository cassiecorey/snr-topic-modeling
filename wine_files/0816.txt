Nice fruit, very drinkable.  Quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard.  Good balance too.   But nice though it is, I find it rather undemanding - no tautness, no succulence, in short no really grown-up qualities.   I'd hope for more excitment from this vineyard.  Still a fine drink, and it doesn't sell for huge money either.  ***
