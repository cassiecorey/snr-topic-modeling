Very pure, high-toned yet silky fruit.  Somewhat in the Burgundian style but with roses, tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe Nebbiolo tannins.   On the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old-fashioned Bordeaux.  Doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well-made it is a pleasure to drink now. Top ***
