Pale tangerine colour in a decanter.  Intensely gingery on the nose (as Ramonet's wines often are) but to a grotesque degree.  Rather horrible palate - probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way.  A day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness. No Stars
