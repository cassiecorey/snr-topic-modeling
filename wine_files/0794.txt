White bread and currants on the nose.  Light to medium weight - elegant fruit. Quite a lot of Meunier - which shows slightly negatively on the palate. Very good but could one ask for slightly more intensity without sacrificing the elegance? I'm not sure.  I'm being critical - but this is very nice.  (2001 plus reserve wines - disgorged June 2004 - I like the informative back-label). Very top ***
